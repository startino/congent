We may sleep to-night with light\nhearts, Caroline!'\n\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\nevent, was one of pleasure.\n\n'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or\nthat dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever\npresent to me.'\n\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;\nand as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\nbut nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house;\nthe dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the\nchildren seated round the fire.\n\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\nin one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\nThe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\nwere very quiet!\n\n'\"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\"'\n\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\nmust have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why\ndid he not go on?\n\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\nface.\n\n'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.\n\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n\n'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It makes them weak by\ncandle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes\nhome for the world. It must be near his time.'\n\n'Past it rather,' Peter answered, shutting up his book. 'But I think he\nhas walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,\nmother.'\n\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful\nvoice, that only faltered once:\n\n'I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon\nhis shoulder very fast indeed.'\n\n'And so have I,' cried Peter. 'Often.'\n\n'And so have I,' exclaimed another. So had all.\n\n'But he was very light to carry,' she resumed, intent upon her work,\n'and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble, no trouble. And\nthere is your father at the door!'\n\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had\nneed of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,\nand they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young\nCratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek\nagainst his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father. Don't be\ngrieved!'\n\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.\nHe looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed\nof Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,\nhe said.\n\n'Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?' said his wife.\n\n'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob. 'I wish you could have gone. It would have\ndone you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I\npromised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little\nchild!' cried Bob. 'My little child!'\n\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped\nit, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they\nwere.\n\nHe left the room, and went upstairs into the room above, which was\nlighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close\nbeside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there\nlately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and\ncomposed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\nhad happened, and went down again quite happy.\n\nThey drew about the fire, and talked, the girls and mother working\nstill. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's\nnephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the\nstreet that day, and seeing that he looked a little--'just a little\ndown, you know,' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.\n'On which,' said Bob, 'for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you\never heard, I told him. \"I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,\" he\nsaid, \"and heartily sorry for your good wife.\" By-the-bye, how he ever\nknew _that_ I don't know.'\n\n'Knew what, my dear?'\n\n'Why, that you were a good wife,' replied Bob.\n\n'Everybody knows that,' said Peter.\n\n'Very well observed, my boy!' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. \"Heartily\nsorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in\nany way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that's where I live.

I mean\nto give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\nI pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\ntemper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it\nonly put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.'\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\nat, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\nmerriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\n\nAfter tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\nwhat they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\nnever swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\nit. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other\ntunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle\nit in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched\nScrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost\nof Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things\nthat Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;\nand thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he\nmight have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with\nhis own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\nMarley.\n\n[Illustration: _The way he went after that plump sister in the lace\ntucker!_]\n\nBut they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\nplayed at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\nbetter than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\nStop! There was first a game at blind man's-buff. Of course there was.\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\nin his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\nScrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\nthe credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\nover the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\namongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\n\nScrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buff party, but was made\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to\ncut\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He is described as a tight-fisted, grasping, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor and a disdain for human sympathy. Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future. He is deeply affected by the scenes he witnesses, including a dark room with a dead man's body and the actions of Joe and others. These reflections and supernatural encounters lead to a significant transformation in Scrooge's character. He becomes generous and kind-hearted, especially towards Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim, and experiences a change of heart, ultimately becoming a man who embraces the spirit of Christmas and human sympathy.\n\nIn summary, Scrooge's character arc takes him from a miserly, solitary old man to a generous and kind-hearted individual, profoundly changed by the ghostly visitations and the reflections they provoke.\",116\r\n13,GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT,\"The Ghost of Christmas Present is a character in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" known for being kind, generous, and hearty.

He is described as a tight-fisted, grasping, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor and a disdain for human sympathy. Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future. He is deeply affected by the scenes he witnesses, including a dark room with a dead man's body and the actions of Joe and others.

He is described as a tight-fisted, grasping, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor and a disdain for human sympathy. Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future.

He is described as a tight-fisted, grasping, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor and a disdain for human sympathy. Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future. He is deeply affected by the scenes he witnesses, including a dark room with a dead man's body and the actions of Joe and others. These reflections and supernatural encounters lead to a significant transformation in Scrooge's character. He becomes generous and kind-hearted, especially towards Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim, and experiences a change of heart, ultimately becoming a man who embraces the spirit of Christmas and human sympathy.\n\nIn summary, Scrooge's character arc takes him from a miserly, solitary old man to a generous and kind-hearted individual, profoundly changed by the ghostly visitations and the reflections they provoke.\",116\r\n13,GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT,\"The Ghost of Christmas Present is a character in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" known for being kind, generous, and hearty.

Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future.

He is described as a tight-fisted, grasping, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor and a disdain for human sympathy. Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future.

He is described as a tight-fisted, grasping, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor and a disdain for human sympathy. Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future. He is deeply affected by the scenes he witnesses, including a dark room with a dead man's body and the actions of Joe and others. These reflections and supernatural encounters lead to a significant transformation in Scrooge's character. He becomes generous and kind-hearted, especially towards Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim, and experiences a change of heart, ultimately becoming a man who embraces the spirit of Christmas and human sympathy.\n\nIn summary, Scrooge's character arc takes him from a miserly, solitary old man to a generous and kind-hearted individual, profoundly changed by the ghostly visitations and the reflections they provoke.\",116\r\n13,GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT,\"The Ghost of Christmas Present is a character in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" known for being kind, generous, and hearty.

Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley and is approached by gentlemen asking for charity during the festive season, to which he responds with his characteristic grumpiness and strictness.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge experiences a series of supernatural events and ghostly visitations that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is guided by various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and a Phantom, who show him scenes from his life and the lives of others, such as the Cratchit household and the impact of Fezziwig's kindness. These experiences cause Scrooge to question the actions and intentions of the spirits and reflect on his own life choices, particularly his pursuit of wealth and its impact on his relationships.\n\nScrooge's journey includes interactions with the spirits where he learns valuable lessons, feels anxious and powerless, and shows concern for Tiny Tim's future.
