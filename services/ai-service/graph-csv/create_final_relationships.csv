"SCROOGE","CHRISTMAS",40.0,"""Scrooge has a complex and evolving relationship with Christmas. Initially, he despises the holiday, considering it a humbug and a time for financial burdens. He refuses to make merry or donate to the poor during the festive season. Despite his outward disdain, many of Scrooge's memories and reflections are centered around Christmas, indicating a deeper, more conflicted connection to the holiday. This complexity is further highlighted by a series of ghostly visitations he experiences during Christmas, where he is guided by spirits to witness various Christmas celebrations. These supernatural encounters and reflections ultimately lead Scrooge to a profound transformation, where he learns to keep Christmas well and becomes generous. The events and reflections of Scrooge predominantly take place during the Christmas season, underscoring the significance of the holiday in his journey.""","['166b41d31c21bdff77c782c019c33814' '38cde9f8e64c2069b4b5b319dbf349e9'
