14:41 - Jorge Lewis we don't know how to put this to work you know like on a website or something I'm going to eat. Are you ready? What? I'm going to eat. Describe to us. We are WordPress.

15:15 - vitor We are a community of WordPress. It's something simple. We just need a CRM and a chatbot to access. We can train the chatbot only to answer the niche questions.

15:54 - Jorge Lewis Because this website has a lot of things that We want to know. You can just copy.

16:27 - vitor We can create a micro-test, which is software, and put two words. See how it works, and then we can put more function items. Yeah? But we have to do a first... First...

16:56 - Jorge Lewis I don't know, how is the name of the... MVP! What?

17:01 - vitor MVP! Yeah, we can put a first MVP and then we see how it works.

17:20 - Jorge Lewis Say again, say again please. Like, we're so busy right now with all of our other businesses that we don't know if we'll be able to have enough time to make this broadcast.

17:43 - vitor It's not like a million dollar idea, it's like a thousand monthly dollars idea, you know? It's just a sandpaper, no?

18:00 - Jorge Lewis Something like that, not a million dollars, you know? Don't worry, bro.

18:18 - vitor When we have time, you can see this with more patience and think more about and we can see what we do, you know? Yeah we we think about it too it's like you you say we we planned the platform like you say we search some platform that is working right now and we like I don't know. We send our clients into this platform, like to a Reddit platform, and state some percentage about the client. But what? Fuck. It's like our second option, you know? Our first one. We will think about it like last night.

20:01 - Jorge Lewis We will think about it. So, ah, let's talk to Jorge and see what he thinks about it.

20:07 - vitor I think we have a lot of, a lot of Softwares like like this to sell in cold Kenya. We came back for test $30 We just have to put it work We buy for $30 and make $1,000 for I can't hear Say say say Yeah, that's a good idea too. But it's something that we just planned yesterday night. So we don't have nothing like 100% sure. We just talk about this with you to see what you think about. But until Vietnam and during Vietnam, probably we'll have more ideas to do together. Okay More more customized Country Like, that's what we want, you know?

23:33 - Jorge Lewis That's what I try to say for you. What? Probably yes, yes, yes.

23:54 - vitor Some, some platforms, sorry. Yeah, that's why I, I tried to copy something, you know?

24:00 - Jorge Lewis But, improve better. I'm not trying to make you cry, I 100% think we can make it better. This guy is probably one of the best users of the new technical experience, so if you're trying to make it, it's gonna be a little bit tricky, but it's what he does, and it's not very good, I think. So it's not gonna work. But man, I know it's just not gonna work, but it deserves a lot of love and people's support on it.

24:24 - vitor That's because your biggest client yesterday, like yesterday night, said like, hey, we need another platform and I will search for some platform this weekend and like, I will turn off this platform because it's so expensive. So we need another and we need to see for them.

24:50 - Jorge Lewis So ah, we can create one or we can search for another and try to... You can create one. What?

24:59 - vitor You can try to use the same one.

25:02 - Jorge Lewis No. Hmm.

25:20 - vitor What, what, what do you mean?

25:22 - Jorge Lewis Like, what, for, for how long, or? I can share my screen. Okay. Can you see? Yeah, yeah.

26:03 - vitor That's a good one, but we need something that we can put like API from Instagram to like we can capture the leads of websites, of Instagram, of some ads, and turn these leads into our marketing. Like, we can get the email, WhatsApp, and make some email markets, or send some message on WhatsApp. From Google AdSense or Meta AdSense or Wi-Fi. It's like a platform that is used a lot in Brazil. Like you enter on Wi-Fi, but to have access for Wi-Fi you need to put your email or number. You find some new platform and like we can signature this for a month or I don't know because our client need this like to to this week you know So it has to be fast. So we can tell them, ah, buy this one, and we can look in the platform and see what they have best, what they can improve better.

27:48 - Jorge Lewis What can we fix and do the better one, you know?

28:06 - vitor yeah EBI so we we can take this new platform and record something to you guys and pass the information and see what we can prove better our ABBI's Yeah, will you try to learn more about this this new platform
