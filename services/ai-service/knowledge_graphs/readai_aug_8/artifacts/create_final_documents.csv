0:23 - Mike John Eviota 
Can you hear me?

0:27 - Mike John Eviota 
I can't hear you, sir. Lately, I can't hear you. I don't. Yeah, I can't hear you, sir.

0:52 - Mike John Eviota 
Um, you can hear you, sir, Jorge.

0:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

1:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Doesn't work. Does it work?

1:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm sorry.

1:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Does it work now?

1:26 - Mike John Eviota 
Hello, sir. Can you hear me? I can hear you now.

1:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Just a quick introduction. This is Jonas, the co-founder. Yeah, I can't hear you. Yeah, I'm Jonas.

1:39 - Mike John Eviota 
Can you hear me? I think I'm having a internet connection. Okay, okay. Let me, let me connect to different network.

1:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, okay.

2:00 - Mike John Eviota 
I don't like this. What is happening?

2:11 - Mike John Eviota 
What is happening?

2:25 - Mike John Eviota 
I think my internet is stable now, Sir Jorge. I believe it's stable now. I can hear you, yeah. Thank you.

2:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice to meet you, Mike. Technical difficulties out of the way now.

2:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So, how are you?

2:51 - Mike John Eviota 
I'm good. I'm actually just... Doing what makes me happy, like coding.

3:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So where in the Philippines are you?

3:05 - Mike John Eviota 
I live here in Kainta, Rizal. Mostly it's a province, Rizal province, but almost in a city. It's in the boundary of a city like Pasig and Taytay.

3:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. And how do you know Will?

3:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Pardon?

3:27 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you know of Will?

3:30 - Mike John Eviota 
Sir Will is my... I met him in a Svelte community where me and him started studying Svelte when Svelte was in Svelte Tree at that time. It was in a not really stable release. So, me and Sir Will, quite late, I believe Sir Will joined I joined Svelte community that time when Svelte is in very stable stage now. And me and him shared some insight about compiler and some libraries like React because that time React is very problematic and we both have the same issue that I think finding a new library will make the productivity much Much better, and I believe I worked with Serwil in some front-end job, like it was a CMS-based application where I built the front-end, most of the front-end, and he was in charge with the back-end. The back-end is mostly AI powered, like machine learning stuff, just like that. Where I'm just, yeah, he built the entire API, and I'm fetching the endpoint. I'm just calling the endpoint and doing some transformation from the server to the client, then just front-end stuff when I was working with Zervil. And yeah, that's it. Most of my experience is just based in locally here, where I'm building capstone projects and websites for businesses and some local um, enterprise business, such as finance or unfinanced financing.

5:20 - Mike John Eviota 
That's cool.

5:22 - Mike John Eviota 
That's cool. Yeah. All of it is built in. I'm the only one using in here in my country. Then later on, I realized that there's a community.

5:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. How big is the community?

5:33 - Mike John Eviota 
I'm not really, maybe just only 10 is active. Maybe me. I'm only the active there sometimes. Yeah, the community here in the Philippines is not so big, but it is there. It is there. This is a big community and most of them are very skilled and have an entitled job outside the world, nationwide.

5:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice.

5:57 - Jorge Lewis 
My co-founder, he plans on moving to the Philippines like when? Like January? I think like three months after. Which dialect of the Philippines are you speaking?

6:12 - Mike John Eviota 
The problem is I'm only staying here at home and I'm not really socializing. So I'm really not familiar in some places here in the Philippines. But yeah.

6:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool.

6:27 - Mike John Eviota 
Pardon, I can't hear you again. Did I lose my connection?

6:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, yeah, I don't know how I turned I was muted by exit So I was saying I took a look at your profile. I like I liked the way they looked really nice projects You should see n all the time, right?

6:54 - Mike John Eviota 
yeah because that time using a built-in components can take a lot of time since building from scratch is quite repetitive and the colors and such behaviors is most of them is very repetitive so why not let's just use cn we can just back forward programming it since the component is already given to us the the it is headless so we have the ability to modify it from scratch again but The ShedZine is enough. The ShedZine design is enough to bring us the design what we need. So, yeah, I use ShedZine. But sometimes I use, sometimes I copy from Daisy. Sometimes I use Skeleton. There's a lot of UI library in Svelte. There's Beats. There's a Melt. Melt is come out recently, but it was... It is good for Scratch component. But for me, I use Shard because sometimes ShardCN gives a lot of productivity since you can decide if you want to modify it from Scratch or not. If this behavior is enough, then why not? Let's just change the color. And since it's built as a compiler, we can just ignore the bloated stuff ShadCN gives us, since it's underdeveloped, it gives us the JS, plain JS. Yeah, exactly.

8:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Our stack is the exact same. We use SelfKit, ShadCN, Tailwind. We tried Daisy UI for a little bit, but I don't think we're using it right now. Are we using any at all? No, none right now. We did try it. The idea is nice, how it's very minimal and it's pure. But in terms of functionality, when you need to make a lot of apps, when you need to work in a team, ShadCN makes more sense. Yeah, ShadCN.

8:49 - Mike John Eviota 
Actually, ShadCN the best.

8:53 - Mike John Eviota 
I agree.

8:55 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, you know Hunterbyte?

8:58 - Mike John Eviota 
Hunterbyte, yeah, yeah.

8:59 - Mike John Eviota 
I watch his stream always when he was building ShadCN. It's more fun. I can finally quit React.

9:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, he's a legend. Hunterbyte. I want to meet him one day. I want to tell him thank you, because what he's helped with is so much. He introduced Svelte to so many people.

9:19 - Mike John Eviota 
He's the only one making this build kit a battery framework like Laravel or NestJS.

9:24 - Jorge Lewis 
He's the only guy doing it more fun.

9:28 - Jorge Lewis 
More like him.

9:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. Cool. Okay, so I want to go into a little bit about What you would be doing with us. I haven't introduced myself. Sorry My name is Jorge. I've been programming for about six years. I started this consultancy with Jonas last around like eight months ago I I'm from the US and Mexico. I grew up in Hong Kong, but I'm currently traveling around I live where I'm staying in Thailand right now I Our consultancy is a, we help entrepreneurs and startups make their MVPs and prototypes. We've gotten a lot of demand for the AI ones recently. Um, so the project that you would be working on initially would be a life coach Bob, but there's another aspect of the project, which is an LMS. So we would have you work on that most mostly, um, Yeah, that's kind of the idea. And the idea is that what we really value is being able to work long term with our team members. We want to build a team instead of an assembly line. So we want to make sure that the connection between our team is very strong, and we're able to just kind of be honest and be very transparent with our team, have clear communication, and enjoy working with each other.

10:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I think for me, what I value most is being able to grow with each other. If we both start from a low level and then we continue to grow together, for me, that's very nice to see. It's something that I love to see. Even if you grow beyond our company and you choose to work at another company, that still makes me happy to see that our team has grown. So that's what we're looking for.

11:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so that's kind of my introduction and what we're looking for and what we do.

11:24 - Mike John Eviota 
Is it okay to ask a question, Sir Jorge?

11:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Please do, please do. Yeah, please ask.

11:30 - Mike John Eviota 
So our backend mostly will come from Python, right? Since we're dealing with AI stuff.

11:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Interesting.

11:38 - Jorge Lewis 
So we moved, we used to use Python, but then we transitioned it to TypeScript because that's what SvelteKit is amazing at. It is a little bit tricky because Python is stronger, it's better for AI stuff, but there is enough support for the TypeScript that we decided to move for it. So now all of the project is done in TypeScript or Svelte. So that'll mean it'll make it a lot easier for you to probably understand and to work with. We no longer have the distance between an API and the database and then the front end. It's all just one project, so we don't have to worry about that. Yeah, does that answer?

12:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

12:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I can go a little bit into about our existing team. So currently, as of like right now, we are four members. So me, Jonas, and then two other developers. And then we're in the process of interviewing three or four other candidates for AI as an AI role. And then for SvelteKit, we're also hiring for a SvelteKit role. I initially was looking at Will, but he referred me to you. So, and I saw your projects and I really liked them. So, so yeah.

12:58 - Mike John Eviota 
Actually, I do have more projects. I build a lot of stuff, but that's the projects recently I made. So I just showed it up since ShadCN was recently introduced. So yeah, that project is made in ShadCN, but most of my projects made from scratch. It was in my GitHub, but I don't know if you will like to see it. It's just there.

13:18 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll take a look sometime. I'll have Jonas take a look as well, yeah.

13:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool.

13:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have any other experience with programming other than web development?

13:32 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah. I am just focused in web development because I tried to study mobile development, but the demand that time where the clients is really high. So I have no time to study Flutter, but I do. I can read Flutter. Just a basic Dart. I don't know if I can have the skill enough to market it in the team, but I do. I can read Flutter language, but I can't really market it as a skill. So that's why I'm confident to market my skill in SvelteKit and Svelte.

14:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Same for us. We went through a little phase where I was learning Flutter and Dart. We were going to try to make an app, a mobile game for it. But so that's how I learned Flutter and Dart in that. But yeah, we don't know. I liked Dart. Dart was fun. But yeah, cool, cool. Yeah, OK, so I have a, yeah?

14:34 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, Flutter Dart is not really matured enough since it was really used only for Flutter. I don't see any use case for Dart.

14:41 - Jorge Lewis 
The ecosystem was very tight.

14:44 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, yeah. It is quite new. So I think it's, I'd rather learn Go than, Okay, I have a question.

14:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is related to your goals. So I kind of want to ask where do you see yourself being in a couple of timeframes? So like six months, one year and five years. Where do you see yourself? Where do you want to be?

15:10 - Mike John Eviota 
I want to see myself as a most learned full stack developer, so I can share my knowledge to other beginners. And yeah, I think I can bring a lot of experience in the team, hopefully. But one thing I am really quite unsure is that sometimes I question myself that I am really have the ability to do this task, but then after that, later on, oh, I can do it. I have that kind of behavior that sometimes, that's why sometimes will curse me like, hey, why you always think like that? So my motto is just, I want to be better and share my knowledge someday, sometime, someday to other beginners that wanted to be in this type of field.

16:08 - Mike John Eviota 
I see myself maybe in one year or more as maybe an experienced full-stack developer in this field, hopefully in this project. Starkino, right? I think it was in Starkino when I tried to research it, and I see they were using FastAPI and purely spelled from scratch.

16:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Yeah. We, yeah, we need to, that's funny. We need to update our website. Yeah. We, we were using fast API, but now we use, uh, just, just okay. Um, cool. So, so in, in the future, like you want to like coach, maybe do some coaching for felt kid or like maybe YouTube, like tutorials and help share your experience or what were you thinking?

16:53 - Mike John Eviota 
I am actually, actually have a YouTube channel, but it is full of cringe. If you see it, you will see it. Yeah, you will see my learning journey with Svelte and you will find it sometimes very cringe, very cringe of like, more of, why do this, why you do this?

17:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Suddenly, yeah.

17:17 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, sometimes when I see my code three months earlier or a year ago, I think to myself, oh shit. But I can't delete it because, Is it okay, Jem? Maybe it's full of cringe, actually.

17:34 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's fine. That's how, like, everyone had to start someplace. If they didn't start when they were cringed, then they wouldn't have started later.

17:41 - Mike John Eviota 
It's actually full of guides. That time before, in my country, I was the only one trying to force the, force the beginners to study Svelte than study React because it is a very good, um, have a very good, uh, understanding in how, how the, how should the DOM manipulates and we should get rid of virtual DOM. And, but yeah, that's why I make a channel so I can share my knowledge with Svelte. And I think I failed to, to persuade some of them. So, because, uh, The React power in my country is very huge. The demand is so high that when even you have the skills like making to-do list, you can actually land an actual job just with the to-do list skills in React. That's how high demand React in my country. But I still use this belt because I love this belt. It is very the future.

18:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I think SvelteKit is definitely going to keep growing. Fundamentally, it's a really good framework. It's an amazing framework to work with.

18:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the SveltePack also is game-changing.

18:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, personally, I only used Svelte until SveltePack came out and I was doing business tasks, so I haven't tried it really.

19:03 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, we can actually use SveltePack, which is stable.

19:08 - Mike John Eviota 
The candidate release is just waiting for the documentation to be finished because Rich Harris, I see Rich Harris, they were just only building the new web dev website. So I think that is the only left. So if the website is finished, they will officially release this belt pipe as official stable release. But the candidate release is enough. That's why Hunter Biden is rewriting the library to his belt pipe. He's starting it now, if you see.

19:38 - Jorge Lewis 
We're using Svelte 5 in our projects right now, right?

19:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

19:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Svelte 5 has good legacy support for Svelte 4. Yeah, we are using it, but I don't think we're using any of the new features, like runes or stuff like that.

19:52 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, that's cool. I use Svelte most 5 of my projects I build in Svelte 5 now, and I don't find any breaking changes. Everything is working. It's just with that.

20:06 - Mike John Eviota 
Class-based activity is very unique than the store, than using store. You derive things in the server and bang, the server crash. But in Rooms, you can just get the state in the class, then it works even in the server, even in the hooks, even in the sequence, it works. That's so cool.

20:30 - Jorge Lewis 
That's great. Well, I've got to go soon. It was amazing talking to you, Mike. Is it Mike or Mike? Which one?

20:39 - Mike John Eviota 
They call me Mike. Mike is actually my nickname. They call me Mike. But my full name is Mike John. Mike John, but you know, maybe you're not.

20:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Mike John, maybe you're not. Yeah. Okay. I'll call you Mike. Do you know Mikey Bustos?

20:56 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah. He's a streamer here in the Philippines. He's very famous. Yeah, Mike Bustos.

21:04 - Jorge Lewis 
That's funny. I know him because, you know, he does, uh, he's Ants Canada, right?

21:10 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, he's, uh, multinational. I think he's Canadian. He's Canadian, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Calma si Mikey Bustos, eh? Yeah, I think, uh, he's a multinational because I see his blog, but most, most of his blog now is here in the Philippines, maybe. Yeah, yeah.

21:29 - Jorge Lewis 
He was a lot in Canada before, but now I think he's staying more in Philippines.

21:33 - Mike John Eviota 
He's quite exotic. He has some ants. He has channel for ants.

21:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

21:41 - Mike John Eviota 
All right, man.

21:43 - Jorge Lewis 
It was great meeting you, Mike.

21:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Great to see you.

21:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll send you a message over the weekend to let you know how we can move things forward. Do you want to stick with Upwork or do you want to move off of Upwork?

22:00 - Mike John Eviota 
I think I will be sticking with where are you more comfortable because in Upwork I have no problem or in Discord I have no problem. Actually, I have no problem but it's the best.

22:14 - Jorge Lewis 
The only thing is just Upwork, I think they take a percent from you, right? I think 10%?

22:18 - Mike John Eviota 
Yeah, they have a percentage deduction.

22:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but then they also provide you with security as well, so maybe how we can do it is we can start on Upwork, and then if things are going really well, we can move off of Upwork. Does that work with you?

22:34 - Mike John Eviota 
It's okay, it's okay. Or if you want to send it directly to PayPal, it's okay. Or if not, Upwork, no worries.

22:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we can see. Yeah, not a problem for us. We don't have to work through Upwork. Before when we first started, we believed that Upwork, the benefit to us was that we could track the screen and the hours very accurately. But now we've kind of had to have a more just holistic approach where we should be able to feel that our team is working all hard enough to what they're saying they are. And I feel like if we're tracking their screen or their hours, then it doesn't feel too transparent. And it kind of promotes behavior that isn't the kind of desire. So yeah, I mean, we'll work with whatever we're both comfortable with. If it's off of Upwork, I'm fine with that.

23:29 - Jorge Lewis 
And you get to keep more of the money, so.

23:32 - Jorge Lewis 
That's good. That's a good idea.

23:34 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, Mike. Thanks for chatting, man. I'll see you around.

23:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Thank you, sir. Bye-bye.

23:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye.""","10 Min Preliminary - Mikey Transcript.txt"

Thu, Jun 27, 2024

1:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello. Can you hear me?

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I can.

1:39 - Jorge Lewis 
How are you doing, Mo? I'm doing well so far.

1:42 - Jorge Lewis 
How are you?

1:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm doing great, yeah. Good. Having lunch? I think you're in the Philippines? Yep.

1:51 - Jorge Lewis 
What time is it for you right now? It's 5 p.m.

1:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, it's close to dinner, actually.

1:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice.

1:59 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm in Thailand currently.

2:00 - Jorge Lewis 
4pm for me.

2:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, I see.

2:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Where in the Philippines are you? I'm currently in Makati, the business district.

2:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice.

2:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

2:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so just a little call to introduce ourselves. Get to know each other.

2:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, I guess I could start us off and then you can follow up.

2:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So my name is Jorge.

2:31 - Jorge Lewis 
I've been programming for about six years. I started with game dev, went into some competitive programming, then some machine learning and Python. And then now in the last year, I've done web dev.

2:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Last year, I started a consultancy, this consultancy with my co-founder Jonas. We started with just making simple websites, but we've pivoted into and kind of evolved into making MVPs and prototypes. But we've gotten a lot of traction for AI ones recently, but we just do all of the above for any startup or entrepreneur. So yeah, that's what we're looking for, someone to help us out with the SvelteKit part and to kind of just help us develop the apps.

3:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

3:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Anything else or should I speak, should I introduce myself now? Yeah, go ahead.

3:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

3:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, for my part, hi. I have been a Svelte user for about a year now. I have been an active member in the Svelte Philippines community. I'm also a bit knowledgeable in Python, AI, and a lot of the backend stuff. And I guess I dabbled a bit on project management. So you can actually say that I'm a bit of a generalist in terms of web tech. I know a lot about anything, but not necessarily an expert, except on Svelte. I think I can say that I'm knowledgeable enough in that field.

4:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you in school right now? Or are you graduated? I'm currently...

4:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I don't have any commitments education-wise. I'm looking for work. Okay, cool.

4:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you... So for us, we're looking for someone to work with long-term. We want to really build a team. We want to build a team that everyone's comfortable working with each other, build a long-term relationship. I feel like that way, if everyone enjoys working with each other, and everyone knows each other, then it makes working a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable. Are you only open for short-term or is long-term something you're more interested in?

5:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm looking forward with a long-term kind of role too. Assuming the company is great and all. Yeah. I think it's a good fit. Yeah, of course.

5:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Ooh. Yeah, so I can give you some background regarding our team currently. So it's me and my co-founder Jonas. We were both programmers, but I've taken on a business role recently. And he's taken more of a high level kind of design and everything. And then we have two developers. One is a Python developer who is helping us build the APIs. And the other one is a SvelteKit developer as well. He's, I think, I think he's a SvelteKit expert, I would say. He only does SvelteKit. So yeah, that's our team. We're currently hiring for a two, or I think probably two LangChain developers. So are you familiar with LangChain?

5:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm not, can you tell me more about it?

6:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, LangChain is a, it's a framework for building like AI applications, pretty much, LLM applications. Oh, okay.

6:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That's, okay. Yes, pretty much just AI developers.

6:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So we're looking for two of those right now. So with the Svelket developer that we're also trying to hire, we'll have a team of about seven. So almost double.

6:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, the company is located, it's based in Hong Kong, but the whole team is remote.

6:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, that's nice. Within the same time zone, I presume. Or less.

6:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Everywhere.

6:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, okay.

6:47 - Jorge Lewis 
My co-founder Jonas is in Thailand with me as well right now. He's actually going to move to the Philippines, um, probably like March next year. Um, but then the rest of the team, one of them is in Switzerland, one of them's in Benin, Africa. And yeah, our clients are based around the UK and the US.

7:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

7:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That's nice.

7:15 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. I just want to know a little bit more about your experience as well. Like, what type of projects have you built? And maybe just kind of go off, maybe tell me your best, your favorite one.

7:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Right now, what I've, yeah, for my past work in Sormonshots, basically, I've helped with the redesign of their website. Basically, Sermon Shots is a SaaS company wherein they turn sermons into shortened clips. Do you have an idea of what Opus is?

7:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Opus, the AI?

7:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Opus, is it an AI product?

8:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, no, no, not cloud. Opus Clip, AI-powered video repurposing. No, no, I'm not familiar.

8:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

8:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, yeah, converse sermons into short clips for Instagram with Facebook reels and YouTube shorts. Yeah, that's cool. And yes, I did play around with my portfolio website, but everyone does their portfolio websites. I guess my favorite one, my favorite one is when I I rewrote my portfolio website in C because I really wanted to get a grasp on how networking works, like from the root on how to create sockets, how to bind them to ports, and how to receive it with all the memory management and stuff.

8:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
You built it with C?

8:55 - Jorge Lewis 
C, yeah. Like the programming language C? Yeah, C.

9:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's kind of the front end is shit because That's what happens when you build a web project with C.

9:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
thinking of creating a templating engine in C, but that's insanely hard. I'm just thinking of the scope right now, and it's something I want to do, but I don't have a lot of time to do.

9:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. That sounds cool. I see on your website, by the way, I've seen that you used Tailwind for one of them.

10:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep. Wait.

10:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me see.

10:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I am proficient with Tailwind as I've used Tailwind for about a year or two now and my previous projects as well. I think Tailwind is the industry standard already so that's why I use it.

10:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
I love it. It's amazing.

10:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know what I'd do without it to be honest. Of course.

10:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Me too. Me too.

10:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you familiar with ShadCN?

10:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
ShadCN?

10:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you worked with it before?

10:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep. I had a friend who advocated it to me. We had this mini debate. His main argument towards using ShadCN is... That it's very customizable, whereas for me, I'm actually a DayZ UI advocate because I like using class names instead of components. But yeah, when I use ChadZN, I understand the philosophy. It's very customizable. It's just that I'm a bit lazy, so I use DayZ UI.

11:13 - Jorge Lewis 
It's funny because my co-founder Jonas, he advocated for DayZ UI at first. In a project, we were like, all right, how about instead of just argument or instead of debating using arguments, let's try them both out and see which one is actually better and more productive. So we tried Daisy first, just better. I think when you're working with a team at a larger scale, Shazam makes a little bit more sense. Daisy UI has nicer fundamentals, like it's more pure, but it only sounds nice.

11:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I'm just saying since most of my projects are by ones, I just need like a component and that's why Daisy is good.

12:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, Daisy is really good if you're just building something fast, if you don't need to build something multiple times. But for us, Shazian is a game changer. So we do use Shazian for all of our projects.

12:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, if you're familiar with SvelteKit, then it shouldn't be an issue. And Tailwind as well.

12:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm familiar with both.

12:31 - Jorge Lewis 
You use TypeScript, right? Just checking. Of course. Of course.

12:36 - Jorge Lewis 
No, you'd be surprised.

12:38 - Jorge Lewis 
You'd be surprised. So many people use JavaScript still. I don't know. I have no clue either.

12:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's like they're fans of PHP or something.

12:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but the people I'm talking to, they're like young. They're like 22 and they're still using JavaScript. And I'm like, wow. I think it's because all the resources are currently still in JavaScript.

13:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Fair, fair.

13:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Also, TypeScript, it has a slightly steep learning curve. Yeah.

13:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
But I think it's good.

13:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, of course, it's good because it requires better code. But yeah, the learning curve is a bit. I think if you know JavaScript, going to TypeScript is easy.

13:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Fair point.

13:23 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, well, any questions for me?

13:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, you told me already the stack. How do you host it? Do you use Vercel or do you use node build? Yeah, we use Vercel.

13:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. We use Vercel, yeah.

13:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I have one more question for you, actually, regarding your goals. So where do you see yourself in a couple years' time? So like six months, one year, and five years, where do you see yourself?

14:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Six months to one year, I can still see myself building the skills necessary to have my own startup. Not necessarily a startup, but my own business. And by five years' time, I will either, if I don't have the capital necessary to start my own business, I will be at the high executive position at a startup or a consultant, web dev consultant, of course.

14:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice. Cool, cool.

14:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Sounds fun.

14:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you thought about what type of business you want to start, if you could?

14:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Of course, as a developer, it's, yeah, it's a developing web development company, but I'm really hoping that I can have that great SaaS idea someday.

14:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, man. That's cool. Thanks for sharing.

14:57 - Jorge Lewis 
As far as I know, I don't have any more questions. What about you?

15:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'd like to know, for this role, of course, this is going to be one of the difficult questions, but what's your typical budget for compensation for long-term employees?

15:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so for long-term employees, we only started in August of 2023. So to give you an idea, our budget for this role is somewhere between 700 and 1,000 month. But the goal really is to not have a budget, but rather, if you can get a better offer elsewhere, we'll match it. Because we believe that if we're working with you, you provide a value that is should be compensated for. And if you can get that compensation elsewhere, then we have to match it if we really like working with you. Otherwise, why would we be working with you?

15:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So that's what we think. Second question that I have is outside of the compensation, what are your expected working hours? Or what time should I be available? Yeah.

16:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So the schedule. Yeah. Sorry. Good question. I didn't realize we didn't go through any of that. Yeah. So for schedule, it's completely up to you. There's just one point in the day. Every day, there's a stand-up, so a daily meeting. For me, that's For you, that would be 3 p.m. Okay. But if that time doesn't work for you on a daily basis, then we would just talk to the team and find a better time.

16:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Other than that, there's no requirements, just 40 hours per week, roughly.

16:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, not much else. We just want you to be really comfortable with how you work. The only things we need in terms of output is just having good communication and then being reliable. That's kind of what we're looking for. Okay, sure.

17:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think I can do all that. Lastly, when can I hear next from you? Of course, I assume I'm going to be tested by my technical skills or whatnot. Yeah.

17:13 - Jorge Lewis 
So for me, today's Wednesday, right? Yeah. So probably early next week, so Monday, Tuesday, something like that. If not, over the weekend. How does your schedule look like, Do you like working over the weekends?

17:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's see. Outside of this one, event that I have at Saturday, I'm usually working on the weekends.

17:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, your microphone's kind of like muffled a little bit. Can you say it again?

17:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, outside of my other charity engagements, I usually work on a Saturday.

17:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then Sunday is the Lord's day.

17:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, the day of the Lord. Yep, yep, cool.

17:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That sounds great, yeah.

18:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool.

18:04 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe I'll be able to get back to you maybe on Saturday or Sunday, if not. Otherwise, just probably early next week. Yeah, cool. Thanks so much, Will. It's been great meeting you, man. Yeah, it's great meeting you too, Jorge. Thank you. I like your suit. Thank you. Have a nice day. Makes me feel underdressed. Bye-bye.

18:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye-bye.""","10 Minute Preliminary Interview between_ Transcript (1).txt"

Tue, Jun 25, 2024

0:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

0:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh I'm doing good. Yeah. So is your name Dewas or is it? Yes, it's Biwas. Biwas. Okay. Nice to meet you, man. Sam. So just a quick call to introduce ourselves and what we're looking for. Yeah. If things go well, we'll discuss how things can go further. So sure. So yeah, I'll start us off. So my name is Jorge, I have been programming for about six years now. And last year, I started the software consultancy with with my co founder Jonas. And we've built it. We started we first started with building websites, and then we transitioned into building MVPs and prototypes for entrepreneurs and startups. So but now, We've got a lot of demand for AI projects, so we're looking to expand our team with blockchain skills. Do you have any questions? A little bit about the team. We're a team of four currently, so me, my co-founder Jonas, and then two other developers. We're looking for two more currently, so that's what our company's team is looking like,

2:27 - Biwas bhandari 
So, okay, first let me start by introducing myself.

2:32 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm Vivas Pandhari. I currently reside in Nepal. I have been coding for around 2.5 years. I also first started with web development.

2:45 - Biwas bhandari 
Then I just switched to AI since the web development was being saturated. The market was very saturated in our country. Everybody was just going in web development and There are no further progress in AIs and that. And there are not more opportunities here in AI also. So it's been around. I first started with BlankChain around eight months ago. I was working in a startup based on San Francisco. And the co-founder introduced me to BlankChain. And he said that it will be more used in future. And now it's being used widely.

3:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Then I did two projects at that time using LinkedIn one, that one, it was called LCIN chain where people can normally query and ask what is the transaction history of my Bitcoin address. And then the result would come using Python. And then after that, I just stopped using it. And on YouTube, I started to find more and more tutorials on LinkedIn. Then I switched to it. And we started coding in Python and build some three to four projects. I think currently I'm building a discord bot using LinkedIn where you can normally ask it about myself. If you have queries, yeah. If you have queries about anything, then you can simply ask, who am I? What do I do? And it replies instantly.

4:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:19 - Biwas bhandari 
That's it about me.

4:23 - Biwas bhandari 
And I'm currently studying bachelors in computer application. So I have college around three hours in the morning, six to nine p.m. And I'm around free, totally free. I just do some project and stuff.

4:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice.

4:40 - Jorge Lewis 
That's all.

4:42 - Jorge Lewis 
And are you in your, which year are you for your school?

4:47 - Biwas bhandari 
Currently I'm in third year now. Just two weeks ago my second year's exam was concluded and now I'm in third year.

4:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay nice, so two more years.

5:01 - Biwas bhandari 
Yes.

5:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice. And are you on summer holiday right now?

5:07 - Biwas bhandari 
Not quite. The school has already started but I haven't gone. I will go from next week.

5:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice.

5:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

5:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I just have a couple questions. So you said, so the question is, was like, what the story of how you got into, how you got introduced to Lankchain? And if I got it right, you previously worked at a startup and the co-founder introduced it to you?

5:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

5:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, cool, cool. Nice.

5:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I did it in Python because there were more easy documentations in Python and JS. They were just introducing it newly. That's why I switched to Python, but I have experience in React, Next.js, TypeScript.

5:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice. Nice. Um, okay. Okay. So if you, if you could have any projects that you could build, like the type of project, what type of project would you want to build? Like what's your, your dream project to build?

6:06 - Biwas bhandari 
For now, I want to build that, um, what do you call it? Like a CA something that CA does when you should just show him your sales report and analyze it and provide you the future predictions.

6:25 - Jorge Lewis 
What is the SA or CA?

6:29 - Biwas bhandari 
Yes. You provide your sales data to the user, to my chatbot. And then that's what will analyze all your sales data from past and how much you are selling and it will predict how much you will sell in next 10 years, five years, depending on. Cool. Cool.

6:48 - Jorge Lewis 
That's really cool. Is it for like, for what type of businesses would use it?

6:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Normally, small businesses cannot hire CA, so it will have a subscription model. And then people can usually subscribe it and analyze their sales report. So it's for small and medium scale businesses who cannot hire CA and pay them more. Cool.

7:11 - Jorge Lewis 
That sounds cool, man. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Yes. Okay, so I just have another question. If it's about your goals, where do you see yourself in the different time frames? So let's do like, where do you see yourself in six months, one year and five years?

7:32 - Biwas bhandari 
In currently I'm learning machine learning too. So in six months, I will have all the basics of machine learning. And then just Querying through LinkedIn and querying through the OpenAI models and JVM models will cost you more and more. So you need to train your chatbots, you know, instead of just querying and increasing more and more expenses and taking more credits. It's good. It should just train itself and stop querying in six months. I should be able to do that. And in one year, two more years, I will have completed my bachelor and start my own startup I'm planning.

8:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, cool, cool. The startup is what you explained earlier, the idea? Yes. Cool, cool. That's cool, man. That's nice. So like a software startup.

8:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

8:32 - Jorge Lewis 
That's cool. That's cool. That's good, man. Um, yeah, thanks for sharing. That's, that's all I have. Uh, Oh, actually I want to talk about, uh, the, the web stack that we use. We use chat, see chat with yes. Okay.

8:46 - Biwas bhandari 
Yes. I was exploring your website and that all, and you were using self lead. Uh, I use, I use that same with react. Almost every project I did, I did it using section. It's very easy to use and that.

9:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. I love it.

9:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

9:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and then, but you haven't used Svelte here, right?

9:07 - Biwas bhandari 
No, I do not have experience with Svelte, but React and other Next.js.

9:15 - Jorge Lewis 
And Node.js. Ideally, you'd be able to learn some Svelte, so that you'd be able to kind of do a little bit of the work yourself. And since you've used ShedCN before, it kind of saves a lot of the front-end work, so.

9:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep. Yeah.

9:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, cool. Yeah, so You know type, you know Lang chain and TypeScript.

9:40 - Biwas bhandari 
Is that correct or yes Not yeah, I haven't used Lang chain with TypeScript, but JavaScript I've used it with and it should not be that much of a difference I can use it with TypeScript Yeah, because we are moving

9:58 - Jorge Lewis 
from Python to TypeScript for all of our projects because it allows us to be a lot leaner with our team. But yeah, the only thing is just the Python documentation and the tutorials are more, there's more resources.

10:15 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, I don't think it'll be too much of an issue. Well, since it's so new as well, if we have like three LangChain developers in our team, we can all work together to kind of learn and maybe post some documentation for TypeScript and tutorials.

10:29 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I've been using LangChain mostly with Google Vortex AI and generative that Gemini Pro. Since OpenAI created, I cannot buy it. And it was free. So I've been mostly I'm more familiar with Gemini Pro and what they say, but if we read documentation, it's, it's all about documentation in LinkedIn.

10:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Yeah. So we can, yeah, it'd be fun. That's cool. All right. Thanks, man. Any questions for me?

11:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Um, no, you can tell me your hobbies. I like to listen to people's hobbies.

11:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Um, so, so before, so currently I'm traveling around, I'm in Thailand right now. I grew up in, I grew up in Hong Kong. Um, so, so that's kind of, I guess, a hobby I'm traveling around. Um, I'm currently in Thailand. Uh, I've been here for like two, three months or two months ish. So that's a hobby. Before I came, before I started traveling though, I did jiu-jitsu, like the martial art, you know, Brazilian jiu-jitsu. But then I don't have time for it right now, so I've just been going to the gym. Just the gym. Yeah, I mean, I like to go to just have some drinks with my friends.

11:56 - Biwas bhandari 
I like watching more and more series.

11:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Like Netflix or? Yep. Nice, nice. Cool, cool.

12:06 - Jorge Lewis 
That's cool, man.

12:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, anything else?

12:11 - Biwas bhandari 
Nothing. So the project will be based on BlankChain and SelfRaid.

12:17 - Jorge Lewis 
That's it. Yeah, BlankChain and SelfRaid. We use SuperBase for our database, by the way.

12:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so I think that's it.

12:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Can you tell me more about your team?

12:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sure. So our team, we're a team of four. It's me, my co founder. We have two other developers. One of them is from Benin. One of them is from Sweden.

12:52 - Jorge Lewis 
So we We, the company started in August, like last August, so it's not too old. We're still growing. Um, we're currently hiring for two or maybe three more people right now. Um, so that's, that's what we're doing right now.

13:08 - Biwas bhandari 
You have two startups. I think one is startt.nu and AIT node, I think.

13:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So we're a software consultancy, so our ITNO project is our own product that we're working on, but we've put on pause because of clients that we've gotten recently. Our main thing is providing services for clients and building their products. But that was a project that we were working on when we were not too busy with clients. So it's still in progress.

13:42 - Biwas bhandari 
Yesterday I tried chatting with it, but it was not responding.

13:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so we put that on pause. Yes, Tartino is the brand behind the consultancy. Yeah. Okay.

14:00 - Biwas bhandari 
So you have experience in machine learning too?

14:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I first started with game development at the very start, like six years ago. And then I did game development for a good while, and then I got introduced to Python and competitive programming. Three or four years ago. So I did those two and then in the last year I've been doing web development and some basic Python stuff here and there for scripting and automating some work. I've been doing a lot of less development myself nowadays because I'm working more on the business side of things.

14:42 - Biwas bhandari 
So, do you have any interest in blockchain development or Web3?

14:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm not into any of that, no, no.

14:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I was really busy building the business when that became popular, so I missed the phase.

14:59 - Biwas bhandari 
Nowadays, there is competition between Web3 and AI, so...

15:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. I think AI will win now. Web3 is still too new, I think. It's still a nice time.

15:13 - Biwas bhandari 
Most of them just started for funding. They do preceding and leave the project.

15:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. It's too early right now for the technology is good, but I think that there's no infrastructure. We need, we need to wait a little bit. That's cool. Um, yeah, well, I gotta, I gotta head off soon. Anything else?

15:35 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so project, when do we get started? How do we get started?

15:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, so after this, I'll let you know on LinkedIn how we can move things forward. Most likely, we'll go through another, maybe one or two more interview rounds, some technical ones, so you can show us how you like to work and how you program.

15:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

15:57 - Jorge Lewis 
And then after that, you'll just get started on one of the projects that we're currently working on in the middle of

16:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

16:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:12 - Biwas bhandari 
I think that's it.

16:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks guys. It was nice talking to you. Thanks for those great questions. Yeah. Hope to see you soon.

16:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:23 - Biwas bhandari

Tue, Jun 25, 2024

0:02 - Jorge Lewis 
23 August, we first started making websites and things like that. And then we started transitioning, we transitioned into MVPs and prototypes recently, I think a couple months ago. And specifically, we do MVPs and prototypes for startups and entrepreneurs. And lately, we've gotten some more demand from people wanting AI projects. So that's what we're looking to kind of scale in terms of what industry you want to do. So that's us. Do you have any questions?

0:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, let me introduce myself. I am Chinmay. I'm currently in the fourth year of my college. I study computer science. And I am studying artificial intelligence in the last year I was into web development before but I was always more enthusiastic about python and deep learning and machine learning so I dived into machine learning and then later on I moved on to studying large language models and then I came across using langchain to maintain web applications and integrating LLMs Nice, cool.

1:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's great. So it's Chinmay or Chinmay?

1:19 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's Chinmay. It's an Indian name, I guess.

1:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Chinmay, right?

1:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Are you facing any noise or sound disturbances?

1:33 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, there's some. It sounds like wind in the background. No, my fan is on.

1:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's a very powerful fan.

1:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, it's quieter now, very quiet now.

1:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry about that.

1:45 - Jorge Lewis 
All good. So, Chinmay or can you tell me again?

1:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Chinmai.

1:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Chinmai, okay. All right. Sorry. It's an interesting name.

1:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

1:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I have a couple of questions. So, what's the story behind how you got into Lanchain?

2:06 - Chinmay Pandya 
So I wanted to make large language models. I wanted to make web application that uses large language models. And so my friend is actually very much skilled in this area of lang. So he suggested to me that I should learn langchain. It's a framework to integrate LLMs into your application. So I started learning Langtian and then I came across RAG pipelines and how to implement those pipelines to be memory efficient and time efficient using vector stores. And I started making projects. I already knew React, as I told, I was into web development. So I was already scaled enough in react and JavaScript and next.js. So I started making projects. And right now, I guess there's a competition for Google, which requires you to make a web application, which embeds Gemini. So I'm also working on a project with my friends.

3:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
that competition is for about 60 days so and my friend is also having a job he's a senior so I do not give that much time so it won't affect any in my schedule But yeah, him and I have many friends who guide me with LLMs and langchain. So I'm working on a project, which is, which is the name is not decided, but it works as is. It's like chat GPT, but it's a visual chat GPT. It gives you. A tree like data structure for research purposes. If you want to research for a particular topic, you just have to pass in the prompt or the title of your research and it will provide you with a tree consisting of nodes and each node will have information. And the nodes will be divided by categories like if you want to search for like AI in finance so it will be it will divide like it will divide the data into categories like key events and further topics and if you click on each node then it will further call the LLM and pass that context summary and retrieve more relevant data and expand your Nice.

4:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That's cool. Um, and how long ago did you start that one?

4:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
We started that about a month ago. We have meetings, uh, two to three times per week. As I said, he, he currently has a job. So he will say it as they cannot afford much time, but I managed for the front end side and he guides me for other limbs and he works most of the time. Cool. Cool.

5:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, thanks. So you said you had experience with web dev before?

5:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

5:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, one second.

5:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So you said you have with web dev. Which framework did you use next, I think?

5:27 - Chinmay Pandya 
I've used pure JavaScript, as well as React, as well as VJS, NextJS.

5:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. We used FeltKit. Do you have any experience with that?

5:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

5:44 - Jorge Lewis 
We used FeltKit. Do you have any experience using that?

5:47 - Chinmay Pandya 
I've heard about that, but I haven't actually used it. No problem.

5:55 - Jorge Lewis 
And then for database, what do you usually use?

5:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
Database for simple web projects, I use the MongoDB database, the cloud MongoDB database.

6:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
And if I have to use extensive data, then I store it in my local SQL database.

6:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
or Postgres.

6:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice. We use Superbase. Have you used it by chance?

6:23 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yes, I've heard about that. And unfortunately, I haven't used that in a project.

6:31 - Jorge Lewis 
It'S not hard. It's fine. I have two more questions. So first one is, if we could give you your dream project, the favorite type of project you could do, what would it be?

6:47 - Chinmay Pandya 
My favorite type of project?

6:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, to work on. Uh, like what do you love to, what type of apps do you love to make and stuff like that?

7:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
I've actually worked on, uh, I have actually had prior internship where I had to make e-commerce websites.

7:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
And so to make apps which require LLMs and also frontend and backend, so it gets me pretty exciting because it's also challenging and it boosts my skills and it pushes me in a zone where I need to constantly develop and debug the errors and keep, it's like a continuous process. So any project which challenges my mind and challenges my abilities is kind of my favorite project.

7:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, cool. Thank you. The last one is, what are your goals for the next time frame? So like, what are your goals for, where do you see yourself in like six months and one year and maybe like five years?

8:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay, so for the short term, I have the last year of my college. So for short term, I'm looking into working with people, working with startups, preferential preferable the startups from abroad give opportunities to Indian students just like yours. So I am excited to work with startups, build my network, build a team and be experienced as a developer and after my graduation if If I feel confident, then I feel like being a freelance developer if I'm not currently a part of any team. But my first preference would be to get a job at a fan company. That's what I'm preparing for.

8:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, big fans, yeah. That's cool. That's great, man.

9:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So like in five years, you would see yourself at a fan company. That's cool. Do you want to live abroad? Do you want to live abroad or do you want to live still in India, like when you're working at the fan company?

9:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
Living abroad always seems like a better option.

9:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's a big move, big change.

9:39 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, it's a big change.

9:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, cool man. Thanks. I think that should be it. I've learned a lot about you. Do you have any questions for me, for the company, or how we like to work, anything?

9:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so actually I was actually I shouldn't say this in an interview, but I was actually unsure of the company because when I looked into the company profile, everybody had an AI AI profile picture. Generated profile picture. So I thought, because maybe you do not know this, but there are a lot of companies which try to lower Indian students and they charge money or they lower Indian students saying that we'll pay you dollars of amounts. And so I wasn't really sure, but I guess I'm satisfied.

10:33 - Jorge Lewis 
What are those companies like, what do they attract? Like, why do they attract people?

10:39 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, they lure Indian students because Indian students want to work with abroad companies. That's the first thing. And the second is that they tell the students that we'll pay you X amount of dollars.

10:54 - Jorge Lewis 
I see, I see.

10:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
But it doesn't usually end up very well, right? So they ask for a temporary payment for confirmation and then they never message you. Yeah, yeah.

11:06 - Jorge Lewis 
That makes sense.

11:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I've ordered some food. I think he's here. So I think we can wrap up here man. It was great meeting you. Yeah, I'll message you I'll message you soon to let you know the plans Yeah, actually I have some questions if you don't mind, okay I don't mind but I'm gonna go get the food. So if you give me like five minutes or two minutes Yeah, sure. All right. Cool. Thanks Hey man, I'm back. So sorry about that.

14:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
Can you tell me about the structure of your startup? Have you hired any other developers from India?

14:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for sure. Okay. So our team currently is, we're four, um, four people in total. It's me, my co-founder Jonas. Um, he's from Norway. He lives, uh, he's been programming for this. We started around the same time. We're really close. And then we have two other team members. One is from Switzerland, Sweden, and the other one is from Benin.

14:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay. So you do not have a developer from India, correct?

14:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Not yet. No.

14:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

14:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
Are you also interviewing other candidates?

14:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Yeah.

14:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

14:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Currently, currently we're interviewing for both, um, the line chain role and then also the spelt kid developer.

14:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay. Can you, uh, give me a brief about my responsibilities if I were to join?

15:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep. Cool. So how we like to work when we have new clients is working in pairs. So we believe that's probably the best way to go forward with things just because it's so efficient, the communication is really good, and you don't have to worry about too many clashes. So for every project that we get, we'll most likely do it in two by twos, or in pairs. And if the project needs two pairs, or if the project needs more than two people, you add another pair instead of just a single person. So we kind of use it as our unit of courtesy. In terms of your roles and your responsibilities, you'll be in charge of helping our team. So currently, I'm the lang chain developer, pretty much, for our company.

15:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think you've got a phone playing in the background.

15:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, it's my mother's phone actually. I told her not to call. She doesn't know that my interview. She came from outside. No worries, man.

16:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry about that. No worries, no worries. Just wait. Alright, cool.

16:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So currently the plan is, by the time we have a new developer, we would have two developers that know Lanchain, so Jonas, my co-founder, and then the one from Switzerland. He still doesn't know Lanchain, but he knows Python, so he's going to learn it.

16:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so you'd be helping the Lanchain part, integrating it to the rest of the project. You would have to communicate with some of the clients probably, at some point you'd have to meet them. Okay. Yeah, in terms of schedule super flexible round full time So just around 40 hours anything around that does and then in terms of schedule on a day-to-day basis completely up to you Weekends you don't have to work. But if you want to maybe like take Wednesday off and do Sunday instead completely fine with us Okay, so you do not have a fixed schedule like nine to five or? No, no, no, because the time zone difference, it's too hard. Yeah, I can tell you how how we work right now with the rest of the team. So the one, Nazif from Benin, he, he wakes up probably around my time, 12pm. That's, that's about it. Oh, one restriction, one restriction we do have, though, is that at At a certain point every day, we have a daily meeting with everyone to let everyone else know how your project is going and how things are going, just to say hi. That is at 2 p.m. For me, so I don't know what time that is for you. So that's the only requirement. I have to calculate that for my time zone.

17:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So, yeah, that's it. Anything I missed out?

18:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, it was, so basically my role would be of like an assistant Lanchain developer, am I correct?

18:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I think in terms of Lanchain, our team is so new to it as well that you would probably be the most experienced in terms of how many years or how many months have you worked for Lanchain or years?

18:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
I have, uh, making projects. I have worked with LangChain for about a year. Okay. Yeah.

18:33 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, I've only been, I've been working with Python for quite a few years, but with LangChain, I only started maybe two months ago, so I'm quite new myself. Um, well, LangChain we've actually used for a little bit longer, but LangGraph is, um, is what I learned like last month. So, yeah.

18:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I think for example, I'll give you I'll try to give an example if this kind of clears things up so I Mean, and I guess a little bit more background in terms of our clients. So currently are we have two clients that are paying us At both their projects are kind of chatbot AI type of thing But one of the clients that we have is a is a really ambitious guy, and he has a lot of ideas. He has a consultancy that helps other, like medium to large businesses to to strategize and how to use AI. That's he consults with them. And the plan is for him to bring clients to us. So those clients wouldn't be startups or entrepreneurs, there'd be big businesses that want to get get an MVP for for some strategy that they discussed. Um, so that's kind of a direction that we might go in, but if he doesn't refer us to any clients in that regard, we continue our current path of working with startups and entrepreneurs.

19:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
That's really exciting to hear. So most of the projects are Python centric.

20:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, okay. All right. We do our lang chain and TypeScript. Now we switched from Python because with SvelteKit, we're able to develop it really like we're able to be really lean.

20:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Beforehand, we had to deal with the scheme of the database changing and the API getting changed. A lot of planning and a lot of time wasted where you have to re-edit things. But now, for the entire project, it's done in TypeScript, and it's all done in one codebase, so it's really simple and lean.

20:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So what's your experience like with TypeScript and then also LANG chain in TypeScript?

20:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
I haven't used Lang chain in TypeScript, but I have used Lang chain in JavaScript. And, uh, for individually TypeScript, I have made a project where I had created a dashboard for admins and it was used to generate invoices. And it was done. It was kind of a dynamic dashboard that I had to use TypeScript. And I also hosted that website. If you want to check it out. Yeah, you can send it over. I can take a look. I can give you the link. It was a very minor project, but it involves using TypeScript and handling data and typecasting. So the entire project was in TypeScript. So I am comfortable with TypeScript. And also, yeah, I use lang chain with JavaScript.

21:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

21:31 - Jorge Lewis 
But your primary one is Python, right? Like you usually work with as an API, right?

21:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, no, not in terms of lang chain. My primary language is Python in terms of deep learning and machine learning. For lang chain, I'm comfortable with both in JavaScript and in Python. I see, I see. Python only because Python has a library called Streamlit. So I do not have to worry about the front end. I can make a quick interface and embed the LLM. So that's why for my most recent project, I used Python with Streamlit.

22:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, cool.

22:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I mean, if we go down the routes of working with larger companies, we'd be making a lot of different programs, but we'd still be working two and pairs. We want to make sure that we don't like for us, we would be as a business, we would probably make more money if we had like 1000 developers on our on our company. And then we just talk we just outsource and bring them in for like one client at a time. But for us, we really want to have like a very tight team. That's like, that's that really likes working with each other. And that way, even a couple of years down the line, it doesn't matter. If it doesn't matter on the clients, but within the company, we all like know each other and enjoy working with each other. If it makes a lot more like worthwhile.

22:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
So you want employees which are trustable and collaborative, right?

22:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like, uh, just being easy. Like we, the first one is just luck and you need to get along with the rest of the team. That one's, that one's just based on luck. Um, and then also just people that want to, that are ambitious. We want you to be able to grow with us because otherwise it doesn't feel like we're helping each other as much as we could. Like we think if we're able to grow together, it's much more beneficial than if only our company grew, but you just, we pay you like a flat thing every time. Like only money, if that makes sense.

23:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. So have you accepted any previous work or any client or something which I can see? So maybe I'll get to learn how you work.

23:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, so our, our first, the, the, one of the projects was in Python and Python for the backend. We use an eight, we use fast API and then spell kit for the front end. But we're currently in the middle of the process of migrating the Python code to TypeScript, switching the SDKs. So we're in the middle of that. And then for the other clients, we haven't started that one yet. We're supposed to get started on that one, actually, already.

24:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
So the work is in middle, right? You haven't deployed.

24:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, it's deployed, actually. Let me send you the link.

24:29 - Jorge Lewis 
And then Seems like it cut out. Did I send the first one?

25:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I got it.

25:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I checked it out. It's it's the same as a it's like a chat GPT.

25:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So that one we're We're working, we're only working on the chat, like the AI functionality. We haven't done any work. It's very simple stuff. Um, right now it's just, it's like a lot of the properties are exposed. It's not done. I mean, to say, right. Um, like the last few weeks of the, of the project, making it look usable for the users.

25:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
I've sent you the link for my project. Uh, the one that I posted, which was built using TypeScript.

25:52 - Chinmay Pandya 
If you want to take a look at it, I've mentioned the link in the message.

25:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm taking a look at it. Um, what did you use for the profile authentication?

26:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
I used an email provider, but, uh, uh, then I scratched that and just, uh, choose the simple username and password because. I just wanted the main thing for the project was how the backend for the dashboard works and not the authentication.

26:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
So I used, but previously I used Google provider, Google auth provider and also the email provider.

26:37 - Chinmay Pandya 
Those are built-in functionalities for Next.js. So with Next.js middleware, it's pretty easy to manage user sessions and use authentication.

26:49 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, the data is coming from the database which is also hosted.

27:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Where's the database hosted?

27:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
The database is hosted in the WordCell itself, the WordCell Postgres database.

27:21 - Jorge Lewis 
It's cool. It's only, is there any AI features in this one or no?

27:27 - Chinmay Pandya 
I haven't included any AI features, but it's the entire project is done in TypeScript and it was a lot of code.

27:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it looks like it. Have you, do you use ShadCN?

27:41 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I switched from use cases. If ShadCN is the better one, Mostly I use and, no, Material, sorry. Material or Tailwind. And I've used ShadCN in one of the hackathons I went. There's a city, Surat, and it hosted a hackathon, a global hackathon for students. So there I used ShadCN.

28:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Gotcha. Yeah, we always use Tailwind CSS, and so far we've always used ShadCN.

28:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's what we use it for our front end. I know you won't be, or I haven't, uh, like the official role isn't for a web dev, but if you are able to learn so kit that, or like some of the web dev part, that would be fantastic as well. Is that something that's like totally out of reach for you? Or what is that? How does that look for you?

28:43 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's not totally out of reach. Yeah. If you talk about my preference, I would prefer to be a Lang chain developer. Because I see my career as an AI ML software engineer. And so I would prefer to be the line chain developer, but if anybody from the team needs assistance in a website, so I have already experienced in react next year. And I also, uh, I like to learn new things, so it's not a problem. I would learn sweat kit anyways. If I have to collaborate with the team, I guess I have to learn it anyways.

29:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool, man. So yeah, if you have no more questions, then I think we're good. I have another meeting to get to.

29:27 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I have no further questions. All right, cool. It was nice to meet you. Thanks for your time.

29:34 - Jorge Lewis 
It was lovely meeting you as well, man. I'll hit you up on LinkedIn soon and we can see how to move things forward.

29:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

29:41 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool, man. Take care. Have a good day or good night.

29:46 - Chinmay Pandya 
Have a good night. You.""","10 Minute Preliminary Interview between_ Transcript (3).txt"

Sun, Jul 7, 2024

0:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Tuesday, so busy week.

0:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice.

0:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, what about you?

0:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I'm doing good. It was a rainy day at my side, so yeah.

0:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you in Pakistan?

0:16 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, I'm from India.

0:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, in Pakistan, it's raining really hard right now.

0:21 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. In India, basically, Mumbai is the main attraction of rain.

0:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it sucks. Does it affect the Wi-Fi and the power often?

0:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, no. It's a city area, so it's not been affected much.

0:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so just a quick little call to introduce each other. I know we kind of gave introductions through the interview, but just a one-on-one in person or real-time one, so we can kind of get to feel each other out. Yeah, sure.

0:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I can start us off just real quick. Once again, my name is Jorge. I'm the CEO of Sartino. We started about a year ago. I myself have about six years of experience programming. We started with making very simple business websites, but transitioned into MVPs and prototypes a couple months ago. So recently we've gained a lot of traction for the AI specific ones and luckily for us, that's something we're That's something we really like to do. We really like making innovative things with things like Lionchain, so that's something we're kind of niching down towards.

1:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Where we look to go is just continue doing AI projects, looking to take on more clients. That's it.

1:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, great.

1:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you want to just say a little something?

1:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah, sure. So, hi there. My name is Hasnain. Talking about my education, I have completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology. And apart from my studies, I have a key interest in participating in hackathons to solve the real-world problems. And talking about my experience, I have completed two internships. So, the first was with AWS Innovate, where I was working under a project called CodeMate, which is a VS Code extension. So I was working under Lanchain Technology and integrating a vector database as a RAG model. And the second internship was with Mericor, which is a US-based startup. So it was a quite long internship of six months where I was building S2S shoes, which is a sneakers e-commerce platform. Yeah.

2:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

2:50 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you like to do in your free time?

2:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, actually in the free time I like to upgrade my skill set and read books on medium or daily.dev. I like to explore new things in the technology domain. Nice, nice.

3:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you play any sports? Do you play any video games? Anything?

3:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. I'm a very great fan of cricket. I like to play cricket in my free time.

3:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice. In Mumbai, is it popular? Yeah, yeah. In India, it's like a festival. Yeah, yeah. I'm aware. India won last week, right? Against South Africa? Yeah, yeah.

3:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Right, right.

3:37 - Jorge Lewis 
They usually mess up the finals, don't they? But they pulled through this time. Nice, nice. You play any video games?

3:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Actually not because I have a MacBook so you know like Apple doesn't allow gaming.

3:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Where's my MacBook?

3:59 - Jorge Lewis 
My one's from 2016. I can't do anything. I haven't used this in like years. When I'm traveling, I use my... You're looking for a new laptop? Okay, one of the Mac, the one from ZenBook.

4:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So you said you finished your bachelor's last year or?

4:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, no, this year, recently, 2024 graduate.

4:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. So like, yeah, okay, cool. Dude, I graduated, I finished my school year last year and I keep forgetting that it's already been a full year. It's crazy. It's already July. Sorry. Yeah, cool.

4:50 - Jorge Lewis 
No problem.

4:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you plan on doing a master's at any time soon?

4:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Not yet, but in the future I might be. I want to upgrade my technology and in the degree perspective as well.

5:06 - Jorge Lewis 
What are the two arguments for getting a master's now or waiting and then pursuing a career already? What do you think about when you decide that?

5:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, currently, I feel like I want to explore more into the industry itself, like working closely with the light projects and building cool stuff. And in the future, I might be doing masters to get a master in computer science degree, because that will unlock much more opportunities in the future. Yeah.

5:40 - Jorge Lewis 
That's great to hear.

5:46 - Jorge Lewis 
What else can I ask?

5:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Not much. Do you have any questions regarding the company, how it works, or myself? Anything?

5:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, not now. I have visited the Startino website. I have got the introduction within that website itself. I don't have any questions right now.

6:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll kind of just speak a little bit regarding it and then also as well as to wrap up I can show or I can talk about the three options how we can move forward after this. So Startino, yeah it's the business we started about a year ago. Currently we have, so like a week ago we had four developers, now we have six. So with this new position I'm hiring for, which you're applying for, it'll be seven. But we're also hiring one or two more web devs. So hopefully within a month or two, we'll have seven to 10 members. We're going really fast. Hopefully, we can keep up the rate of business. If things go well, great. If not, then we'll slow it down. Just trying to make sure not to go too fast, since otherwise the team feels a bit too scattered. We want to really feel tight with everyone. Because if we bring on two new people every week, they'll start working on a project and never have time to have fun with the rest of the team. It'll always feel like things are too busy. So we're trying to make sure we take it slow, not burn people out, and enjoy the time.

7:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so how things could look moving forward from here, there's three options. Dude, I hate these. Do you have the AirPods, or what earbuds do you have?

7:31 - Jorge Lewis 
AirPods.

7:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I bought these Sony ones, the Sony XM5, a couple days ago, but they just keep falling out.

7:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So, anyways. Yeah, so the three options is, number one, we say no, we both go our own ways. Second option is we say yes, but give us some time. We found another candidate that we'd rather have on at this time. And third option is just yes, let's get started. Can you start today, tomorrow? And also for my message, I don't know if you remember, but we adopted just a trial methodology where we just put you in the team, see you work, see if we enjoy working with you, see if you enjoy working with us. That's the most efficient way we feel like, Yeah, so those are the three options. We'll probably give you an answer today is Sunday, give you an answer probably I'm looking for a full-time job.

8:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
With that said, any questions?

8:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, not yet. I will ping you if I have any questions.

9:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Anything at all, let me know. Do you use Discord?

9:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

9:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you use Discord? Yeah, yes. Okay, send me over your Discord and I can add you. We use Discord for all of our communications.

9:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

9:20 - Jorge Lewis 
were cool like that, Fox Slack.

9:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
So you're like 22 then?

9:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh yeah, right.

9:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice.

9:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I want to know a little bit more about the US startup you worked for. So it was an e-commerce company, right? Selling shoes.

9:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah, right. It's Estere Shoes.

9:54 - Jorge Lewis 
How are they doing now? Are they doing good?

9:58 - Hasnain sayyed 
Actually, they are doing well. The co-founders are working in a very MNC based company. So yeah, they are running their startup side by side.

10:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice.

10:22 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you send me an invite of the Discord channel? I will just accept that.

10:42 - Jorge Lewis 
You don't have it on your computer, I'm guessing?

10:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I have the Discord ID.

10:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, I have joined the channel.

11:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Do you have any feedback for me?

11:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Regarding?

11:19 - Hasnain sayyed 
regarding application or any in general, anything you want.

11:26 - Jorge Lewis 
In general, let's see.

11:31 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I mean, things went pretty well. Communication was clear. Things were very smooth.

11:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, if anything comes to mind, like at this point, I'm just trying to provide feedback so you can improve, right? That's the goal?

11:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

11:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So if anything comes to mind, I'll be sure to let you know. We're all about just kind of being straight up honest and providing feedback to help everyone grow. Just no ego, just straight up. If there's feedback for anyone, it's always appreciated. If you don't know something, asking is always the best.

12:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, cool. All right, man, it was great. I created a group chat with you.

12:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, thank you.

12:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So the other person there in that group channel is Jonas, my co-founder.

12:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

12:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, cool. It was lovely meeting you. Okay. You're going to have to, you're going to have to help me out here. So Has. Not like, not.

12:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Hasnain or Hasnain?

12:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Hasnain. The second one. Which one?

12:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
House name, okay.

12:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, right, right.

12:55 - Jorge Lewis 
You know, it's so weird. From high school, all my friends were Indian, and they all had Indian names. But now that I'm interviewing a lot of Indian people online, I don't know if it's the microphone, but I'm struggling so hard with the names.

13:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
By the way, are you from USA or are you living in Hong Kong?

13:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'm half Mexican, half American, but I spent like four years in Egypt, and then I grew up the rest of my life in Hong Kong. And now I'm traveling around.

13:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, that's great.

13:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonah is my co-founder. He's living in Thailand right now. We do kind of have some goals long term, like maybe like within five months to bring bring some of the team members down to Thailand? Would that be something you're down and you're interested in? Of course, you don't have to give a yes or no answer, but does it sound cool is kind of the goal.

13:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
That sounds cool, actually.

13:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, great. Get you a visa and fly you down here. Cool, cool. All right, man. It was great talking to you. If you don't have any questions, I'll see you around. See you soon.

14:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. OK.

14:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Make sure you get notifications for Discord by the way, since I've noticed a lot of people don't. So whenever we message them on Discord, they don't end up replying.

14:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, I will turn on the notification for Discord.

14:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

14:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Great, great. All right, man. Take care. See you around. Thanks for your time.

14:28 - Hasnain sayyed 
Take care. Yeah, nice.

14:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye-bye.

14:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Oops. That's the first time someone's left too early. Usually it's too late. It's like, yeah, take care. And then they look for the butterfly.""","10 Minute Preliminary Interview between_ Transcript.txt"

Mon, Jul 8, 2024

0:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Thank you very much.

1:53 - Nazim Girach 
Hello, hello.

1:54 - Nazim Girach 
Hello. Hi. Hey, how are you, man? Do I call you Jorge or something else?

2:02 - Nazim Girach 
Jorge. Jorge works. I met a Spanish guy with the same name. It was Jorge or something like that.

2:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. My name when I was born was supposed to be Jorge. Jorge. But since I live in an English-speaking place, it's usually Jorge.

2:17 - Nazim Girach 
Got it. Thank you. So you're from Europe?

2:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So my mom's from Mexico, my dad's from the US. But I grew up in Egypt and in Hong Kong.

2:28 - Nazim Girach 
Interesting. So what are you up to? Travelling for your wedding?

2:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I got back last night. My clothes are everywhere. But I'm leaving again on Tuesday.

2:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, brother's wedding in the US. I wasn't planning on going to the US, but just brother's wedding, so can't miss that. But for me, I'm mostly traveling. I like to stay in one place for like three months at a time. Just came back from Thailand. Next step is probably China or Japan.

3:04 - Nazim Girach 
Oh, interesting. So you're like other so-called digital nomads. You keep going to different places and keep working parallelly.

3:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. It's great. I love it. Sorry?

3:18 - Jorge Lewis 
What are you working on?

3:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I have been working... So our most recent project is a life coach, Chapo. It's aimed at helping people keep habits. Yeah, so we've been working on that.

3:35 - Jorge Lewis 
But now, I'm more kind of just taking a step back and doing things like hiring and looking to get some more client acquisition going. Yeah, just more high-level things.

3:45 - Nazim Girach 
So, you're targeting smaller businesses or you're working with, let's say, medium-larger enterprises?

3:51 - Jorge Lewis 
No, we're working with startups. For example, our three clients right now are just entrepreneurs. They're people with full-time jobs that they either quit or are working right now. And they just decided, you know what? I've got all this experience. Let's build an app that solves this problem that I've been facing.

4:12 - Nazim Girach 
So, yeah. So, you're focused on AI or you're taking work as general?

4:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Initially just work as general, but now that we have two projects to AI projects that we're working on I feel like I mean, it's something that we enjoy as well So if we're able to kind of go in that direction more than happy to it's kind of where we're going And we've we've seen the demand for it.

4:35 - Nazim Girach 
So I don't think it's much question really There's a lot of people wanting to build different things in AI. At the same time, I think enterprises also are putting aside budgets for investing in AI. So that's where I think, currently for myself, we are also focusing more on, so I started out, I'm a business owner. Startup warehouse automation company called Clockers. We did our 2 million in sales last year when I quit. And after that, again, I come from a computer science background and I really, when I saw GPT-4, I was like, hey, this is something that will shoot off and I need to change my domain. So I switched off, I quit my earlier startup, started working with my brother for a fashion AI company. We We did about six months of time building it. What we were doing is we were trying to get data from Instagram, Facebook, news channels, fashion shows, processing it in different ways and making like a data bank. And then using that plus company's historical data, we were trying to project how much each particular new design would sell in each store. So, we spent 6 on that, we built a POC, got good feedback, made an MVP, went to the companies for partnership or sales, realized there was no product market fit, we needed to spend more time inside the company, inside the fashion industry to get more understanding of the fashion working sense and then we improvise the product. And given how fast the tech was moving, I wanted to build more things and get my hands dirty. So we tried to keep that aside and there were a lot of people coming to us for projects with AI. So yeah, I started taking up projects on AI. So I worked with a couple of people from UAE, a couple of people from the US. Now I have a major client, Matthew Cassioli from Australia. So right now that's what we're doing. We're trying to target consultants and And people who have already projects in their hands from a lot of enterprises. And we like the back office where we build all the projects inside Azure cloud, AWS cloud, using Lanchain and other data extract. So that's what we have been doing.

6:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So these clients that you guys are working with, they were referred to you by consultants or if I understood correctly?

6:56 - Nazim Girach 
No, no. Consultants keep the client. So what right now consultants are doing is they are basically helping companies analyze their own company and see where the gaps are. Help them with a strategy, give them an action plan of how to do it. And then they tell, hey, I can build that for you as well. Like, if you want me to, this is what the charges are. Most of the companies, because it's the same consultant, they give it the order to them and then these consultants give the order to us to execute these programs, build it in their infrastructure and execute them.

7:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it kind of white-labeled? Does anyone know about your company's name or is it kind of behind the scenes?

7:32 - Nazim Girach 
It is not white-labeled. So usually a lot of enterprises, let me give you a little bit of example. So all the companies who are say maybe above 100 dollars, they want to keep the data with themselves. They want to keep the AI solutions inside their own cloud. They don't want to keep it outside the cloud. There are a lot of AI products like meeting review, meeting summarizers, or LinkedIn post generation, all those things. Companies like smaller startups and smaller companies are experimenting with that, but enterprises are not. Because what has happened in the last couple of years is, a lot of AI startups have gone bust. So these enterprises are very scared on adopting these products. They are like, hey, if I adopt this product across my organization and it goes bust next year, we are screwed. And because it takes about six months or more than that for them to adopt this product as well. So for them to switch a new product immediately is very difficult. So what they do is they try to build the same kind of similar solutions inside their own cloud. For example, a lot of people I work with use Azure, like a lot of medium sized companies use Azure. And what we try to do is we try to build whatever logic they need, whatever say AI bots or whatever knowledge, CAD bots they need inside their own ecosystem, deployed inside their own teams. So what happens is it's not outside, it's in their own Azure cloud and whatever is communicating, communication is happening inside the teams, but nothing is going outside. And so they were comfortable with that. And because it's like a gradual implementation, that's what a lot of enterprises I see are going towards. They're not going towards product adoption. Again, depends on the risk appetite of a lot of companies, but a lot of non-tech companies are very scared of adopting these products that are there in the market. So that's one thing we are seeing in the market.

9:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's great. Thanks for sharing. Kind of what you mentioned how you guys work is kind of similar to how I think we might end up going one of our clients Is a he's been working in the IT industry for like 15 years now Uh-huh, and he's he's quit his his job at his consultancy for to start his own AI kind of strategy consultancy So he's talking with a lot of big companies like kind of enterprises to see how could how can they reduce their costs with and just other things how to how to use AI and another tech to improve their business. And then he's going to refer them to us or kind of just pretty much what you guys are doing where they're just like, yeah, these guys can build it. So that's kind of one angle. And if that doesn't work, if the clients he brings to us aren't kind of like the ideal clients or if just he isn't able to close any, then we would just go down the same route we're going down now, which is just startups and entrepreneurs. So it's quite fun working with just these really passionate individuals and they have a vision. And it's like always, usually we only take on the very interesting projects, but of course, if they have the money, then if, and if, if the business model makes sense, then if it's just copying a software, that's very simple, but changing one thing that'll make it better than the other one, then that's okay with me.

10:33 - Nazim Girach 
What's the tech stack you're using right now? Like what do you usually work with?

10:36 - Jorge Lewis 
We use Vercel for hosting, Cellkit for the frontend and backend. We did use Python beforehand, but we moved our line chain stuff to TypeScript. So now everything is done in TypeScript. What else? Superbase for the database.

10:54 - Nazim Girach 
So you're deploying AI solutions in a web interface?

10:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:01 - Nazim Girach 
It's more of a chatbot kind of solutions or it's more like complex ones with knowledge?

11:07 - Jorge Lewis 
One of them is a chatbot. So the life coach one, it's an advanced chatbot. I'd like to think about it. We wouldn't be happy building just something very simple. It's something that we're going to hopefully be really proud of It's using a whole bunch of different systems like RAG on the data source that he's given us. A whole bunch of analysis on data, just a whole bunch of cool features that I'm quite excited to... I started the development myself, the first two weeks of the Lanchain dev was me, but now I'm pushing it to the rest of my team to take over. So, hopefully they're inspired by my code.

11:50 - Nazim Girach 
Nice. So, you have a team working with you or it's different developers remotely working with you?

11:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Our team as of last week was four, but then now we are six. I'm currently hiring for, and they're going to be seven next week and then hiring for eight right now. Still undecided though.

12:13 - Nazim Girach 
Yeah. But you're the only owner in the company right now?

12:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's me and my co-founder. My co-founder is Jonas. He lives in Thailand. Yeah. So where we just were.

12:24 - Nazim Girach 
Oh, interesting. So these developers, you're keeping them on freelancing, or you're hosting them full-time?

12:31 - Jorge Lewis 
We're hosting them full-time, but all the paperwork's under as a contractor. It just keeps it really simple and lean for us and for them as well.

12:40 - Nazim Girach 
So again, one maybe feedback or input I would need from you. I had a question basically. How is your marketing strategy right now? What's your main lead source? How are you getting your work?

12:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Our first client in the MVP and prototype area was a referral from my co-founder's friend. So that one was just super lucky. The second one was from Read.AI. He put a post, something technical related to chatbot. And I told him, yeah, try a link chain or take a look at it. And then he ended up asking, hey, Could you could you coach me on this because he's a tech guy, but he hasn't yet coded for like 15 years So he was like, hey, can you coach me how to close this myself? And then so he looked into it at his own time and then realized yeah, probably not the best idea So he ended up just hiring us to help him build it and the third one that we're planning on and in the planning phase right now Was from the second client so they're they're really close buddies those two Yeah But I think in the future after we finish, because during the onboarding and development of that second client, I spent all my time doing the developments. But now that our team has increased a little bit, I'll be able to take a step back again and do what I do best, which is sales and marketing. The areas I'm looking at or going down are probably just going to be, I'd like to take on a new approach, I think. I don't know if it's new actually, but I think it is, which is just Ads and content marketing. I noticed since dev houses are so traditional, they kind of stick to the cold outreach methods, which of course works. We'll definitely try it out. But I want to try out other strategies, which is through just Google Ads, Reddit Ads, some Facebook Ads as well, but our ICP is in there. And then just some content as well would be cool to make.

14:40 - Nazim Girach 
I think LinkedIn also is a very good source for getting leads. So again, I have not been very extensive in marketing on LinkedIn, but I have a pipeline set up which I want to start churning out projects. Because what I've realized is there are a lot of posts about hot leadership on LinkedIn, like people in AI space, this is what could be done in AI, this is what you can do with AI. Show like in a sense you know hey this is a team's app this is where you can say maybe upload your HR policies and you can have an HR bot that talks to your system gives you interview packs gives you questions to ask certain questions or you know how to terminate an employee all those things so when you have such videos or projects made and you publish it on LinkedIn I think that could give good traction as a So that's what I'm thinking right now. I've got good leads till now. And I think I've mentioned to you, I messaged you about the AI Hackerspace episode. So like, how I operate is I spend 70% of my time and whatever extra time we have, if we don't have clients. So we only book 70% of our time for clients and the remaining 30% put on developing new things, learning new projects, developing new demo projects. And there's this Saturday, Friday Hackerspace, where I just demo the project that we built. And yeah, it gains some traction. People message me on LinkedIn, and some of them book a meeting. And I think that's one good way as well. So maybe if you're looking to advertise a bit, try LinkedIn. LinkedIn also is pretty good.

16:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's great like I feel like yeah these new routes were just like doing other things and then cold outreach and like email marketing think like these things where it's just producing some content that is interesting but also provides more practical insights into how AI can be used because like everyone's like oh yeah so much potential you can do this and that but who's doing it like no one no one's getting told who can do it so yeah that's cool I'll definitely give that a shot we're definitely on the same page about like we want to make sure our team is not fully like booked up because then we can't have time doing what we love which is like work we'd love to work on some like of our own projects and open source stuff we'd love to improve the documentation around langchain.js since it's it's terrible I don't know if you do you guys use langchain.js?

16:48 - Nazim Girach 
Not js, I use langchain. Langchain has become better like over the past year but yeah I know how it was probably a year ago. And we work a lot with Microsoft, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Bot Framework, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft AI Studio. We build a lot of Microsoft stack. It's horrible out there for Microsoft. There's not a single article I found about implementing Bot Framework systems with Teams. Not a single one. So it's very bad. So I also want to write some articles, documentation to help others out as well.

17:22 - Jorge Lewis 
It's just what we enjoy and also as a side bonus, it'll bring traffic. If you're building things that people can check out that's open source, it helps a lot I feel like, And especially for image, it does a good thing as well. How big is your team? How are you guys working right now?

17:41 - Nazim Girach 
So right now, it's me and my brother who are the main developers. We have an intern full-time who is again, who's learned LinkedIn for the last couple of months and now he's building projects. Whatever I want to know, demo now. He started out this month, building projects. He was learning before that. I have three more interns who are just doing smaller work. I have two full-time developers who are having a full-time job. But I did join in, you know, just come in if the work is needed. And I'm now trying to hire two more freshers because I want to expand as well. I'm seeing a lot of demand coming in. So probably potentially end of this month and next month as well, I might be closing a few more deals. So I'm also expanding my team right now, especially with Python developers right now. So that's what we stand for.

18:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I've got it.

18:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Since we're looking for LangChain.js developers, and in my search for the LangChain.js developers, I've come across quite a lot of Python ones. I can send them your way as well, if you want.

18:39 - Nazim Girach 
Oh, sure. That would be quite helpful. Are they Indian, or where are they based out of

18:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, mostly India or Pakistan.

18:47 - Nazim Girach 
Got it. Because it'll be expensive for me to hire someone from outside India.

18:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. How much should the interns I'm guessing are either free or like super cheap?

19:01 - Nazim Girach 
My interns are kind of my brothers and my cousins so I'm like hey guys I'm starting this you want to join so all of them are really excited so I'm like why not? They'll learn. I'll get some free labor. So that's what we are at right now. And I don't mind paying them but for them but it has to be like a for a paid contract so I've made it clear with them like if I have a paid contract you're working on a paid contract you'll be get paid but I think it'll be not much at the same time for full-time developer I am planning to hire somewhere around of you usually do dollars right so let me listen dollars yeah dollars So somewhere around $15,000 per annum.

19:53 - Nazim Girach 
So that's, I think you can find a refresher.

19:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, probably. For our first developer, it was our first developer that we hired. He was a web developer, first of all. Best developer I've met so far, apart from my co-founder Jonas, maybe even better, I don't know. He was super talented, but we got him for like, Math.

20:21 - Jorge Lewis 
For like $520 per month. Absolute legend, that guy. We're now paying him like $800 a month.

20:29 - Nazim Girach 
That's pretty good, I would say. And is he in India or Pakistan?

20:34 - Jorge Lewis 
He's from a place called Benin in Africa. It's a country. Yeah. Yeah.

20:41 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's even cheaper in there than in India, which is crazy. And his English is great as well. He is absolutely phenomenal.

20:50 - Nazim Girach 
That's interesting. Where did you find him though?

20:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Upwork. I was so shocked. Usually, on Upwork, you don't get the best people.

20:59 - Nazim Girach 
Upwork is expensive as well sometimes.

21:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, because they get charged a fee as well. And they are always increasing it every few contracts. So, it was like a needle in a haystack.

21:13 - Nazim Girach 
And you got lucky with that, huh?

21:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, super. I think he was like out of three people as well. We have an intern that we are kind of paying.

21:31 - Jorge Lewis 
400 a month just kind of like as a just we don't want to feel like we're wasting your time But he's mostly just doing a lot of learning. Yeah, but he lives in Sweden so it's like it's it'll never work out long term in terms of like cost which we're both aware of but hopefully we're able to build up his portfolio and get him a lot of work experience and then Maybe later down the road, if he grows enough, he can take a management position, but he's just way too expensive. His minimal salary is like the top 1% India or Pakistani developers.

22:06 - Nazim Girach 
Yep, that's the case. So, again, one last question maybe. Maybe you can opt to not transfer that as well. In terms of pricing, how are you charging your customers? Is it for hourly basis or are you taking project basis?

22:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, I got these new headphones or these new earbuds.

22:24 - Nazim Girach 
That's clear though, I can hear them clearly.

22:27 - Jorge Lewis 
That's my microphone. These earbuds keep falling out and every time I have to fix them, this side changes the noise transparency and this side pauses the video in the background. So super annoying, sorry. Yeah, so we're still trying to figure it out. We first started off with just doing project-based.

22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
And then, for some reason, I had the idea to do a weekly basis, like a weekly retainer thing. And then, that kind of ended up working okay, more or less. But then, with the clients that we were going to first adopt that with, we kind of ended up just going into, you're going to pay this amount for the project, so really just project-based. We gave them the context of this is kind of our weekly rates So I think in the future we'd kind of like to stick to mostly project based with just telling them Hey, this is our weekly rates. So if the scope changes, this is kind of what you're expecting Since since hourly I feel like is too fine-grained and like really no point in tracking maybe at a much larger scale for sure But for us with with us, I think working with weekly just makes a lot more sense web dev estimating does not work and or sorry, development estimating does not work. So we're at this point, we're just like, just, yeah, just whatever.

23:44 - Nazim Girach 
Got it. Yeah, interesting. But I think that's eventually, like, I would say it's a good spot to be at doing project based. But my only concern with project based is our timeline, like a lot of times, there's client expectation that's different from what you have set them. And then it takes longer than what you expect.

24:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So Yeah, that's the biggest thing I've learned in the past two months is just expectation management. It's the most taxing thing of doing development, really. And it's something that you just have to get good at, and it's something you have to really set early on and say, hey, we're good at what we do, but we haven't done this exact thing before, so things change. Yeah, the timeline thing is just kind of, I feel like when you do project based, more of what they care about is knowing that, okay, this is how much the project will cost. And this is roughly the timeline. But I think telling them, hey, the timeline is The timeline isn't the important part. The important part is that you're paying this amount. The timeline is up to us. We'll discuss this. We'll try to stick to it, of course, but that's not what you should be focusing on. The point of the project base or the best benefit of the project base is probably the fixed cost for the client because when you go into hourly billables, the clients, especially when they're depending on the company really, it can range from like three to four times the initial price.

25:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Although, like I said, that one client that could bring us some enterprise clients, he was asking for our hourly rate. I had no clue what to tell him. For our new developers, for the freshers, we give them $800 a month. So that's I think $10 hour.

25:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I had no clue what to charge or what to tell our clients what to price us at. I told him 40 is where we want to start at, but later down the road I think in the UK, he's from the UK, in the UK I think the average price for a senior I think is around I'm 100 not mistaken.

25:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Dollars, I believe. I might be totally wrong, I'm not sure.

25:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, I think that's what I'm pricing at, I don't know if that's low or high or anything.

26:01 - Nazim Girach 
I kind of think it depends on the client as well. A lot of clients don't research a lot. For example, if you know someone and he doesn't have time, he's maybe willing to pay $50, $100 well. But if you have a client who has enough time, who knows the market well, he could know.

26:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Our client, he's been in the IT space for 15 years, he's managed like 50 developers before, so he knows usually the rates, so we can't tell him anything random. And also the clients for his consultancy, they've done development outsourcing multiple, many times.

26:41 - Jorge Lewis 
He was laughing at it because he didn't belong at the table, but he was talking to the head of NVIDIA and Dell UK sector, and he was getting a lot of insights from them. Yeah, those companies are investing tons of money into AI. Dell is doing, I think, web AI consulting as well. So like for enterprise level, that's kind of where their money's going at right now.

27:06 - Nazim Girach 
So yeah, let's see. So right now, that's my whole goal to niche down to things where I become a commodity, our service becomes a commodity, become do things that are more rare. So right now we're moving more towards agentic work. I'm experimenting a lot with agentic workflows and we grew AI.

27:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I definitely think that's the future. Like for me, I personally believe chaining and just being able to chain different steps of a generative AI model is just where all the future is at because Exactly.

27:40 - Nazim Girach 
I don't understand.

27:41 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know how though, like it just, it makes so much sense, but people aren't using it. I don't know.

27:46 - Nazim Girach 
No one is using it. And when there are very few developers who are developing it, like, you know, working with it and this itself, like there are few developers inside tech company who are doing it for their own tech company. There are very few, like, you know, agencies, I would say, what focusing on agentic stuff. It's all focusing on drag and, you know, simple Java application. That's what I'm trying to niche down and go in that direction.

28:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. One of our projects that's in the planning phase is a multi-agent marketing team. There's two projects that exist out there, but they haven't gotten anything. It's just all smoke and mirrors. They haven't gotten anything down yet. So our goal is to make sure we produce the best stuff. And I think with the tools we're using and our team behind it, I think it's possible.

28:28 - Nazim Girach 
Okay then Jorge, I think I'll have to call my day.

28:31 - Nazim Girach 
It's 10pm here.

28:34 - Nazim Girach 
I'll have dinner and take rest some. But yeah, it was nice talking to you. Likewise man. Good conversation. Let's be in touch and maybe our paths cross or maybe we can discuss some ideas as well. That'll be helpful. For sure, yeah.

28:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll be down to have another talk sometime. I've met actually quite a few people doing what we're doing, which is like a generative AI consultancy.

28:57 - Jorge Lewis 
What I'm thinking is we can maybe work all together. You're the first person I've met.

29:04 - Nazim Girach 
Maybe we can do a meetup, a joint call to see where everyone stands, exchange ideas. Maybe if we need someone with a helping hand, we can help each other. That's one thing we can do.

29:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I think community is something I'm missing in what I do because for all the other businesses like social media and all these other businesses, they have communities where they can share their learnings and experiences. But for dev houses, it's pretty hard. I don't know.

29:32 - Nazim Girach 
And I think that if we're doing it and catching all of them and building a community is the critical part. I think I'll be open to it. If we're able to arrange maybe two or three more people, I'll be ready to get involved with discussing. Yeah, cool. Sounds good, man.

29:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks so much for your time. Let's keep in touch. Do you have Discord? Do you use Discord?

29:49 - Nazim Girach 
I used to, but I've been super busy off late, so I haven't opened Discord yet for like two months now.

29:55 - Jorge Lewis 
We use Discord as our main communication, so that's where we chat. We can keep in touch on LinkedIn, but later down the road we can use Discord if you don't mind.

30:04 - Nazim Girach 
Sure, no issues. And let's see, if you're able to arrange the call, I would really love to come on a networking call. I love talking to people, exchanging ideas.

30:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for sure. But otherwise, I'd love to have another call just me and you, if you don't mind just kind of going into a few more things. Now that we have like the background of each other, we could probably prepare some questions that we might have.

30:22 - Nazim Girach 
No issues. They can do that. And we will have some interesting projects, which might be interesting to you as well. Like I found like this one I'm working on where it's an consulting project where we gather company's information. There's a few government websites in the US who have detail about each job roles that are present, about 1000 plus job roles. We populate that info with company and make a virtual organization tree, analyze each task, see where AI can be implemented, build a deep report for the top three to five tasks, make it visualizing, make it look pretty, and then give you the output. So before you go into a meeting, you have a report in your hand. Like that's a lot of attention from a lot of consultants I've met. So that's one thing I'm working on. Probably next week I'll be able to finish it up. But yeah, next time we meet, we should be able to see that as well.

31:09 - Jorge Lewis 
See, even if we can't, even if we've spoken everything about our businesses and we know each other's businesses in and out, we can still always discuss these AI ideas because there's so much potential, like just brainstorming.

31:21 - Nazim Girach 
Because again, we only had half an hour. If we had an hour or so, that's what usually I do. I go first half, we just discuss about things, where you come from, some ideation from your thought process, what you're seeing in the market. Next half, I try to focus more on discussing ideas, brainstorming, what are some ideas you're seeing. In the market, what ideas I am seeing in the market, what ideas we are building, we are building, what you want to build. We can brainstorm some ideas. So I love doing that. So probably some other day. Right now, our brain is really exhausted. We have worked a lot over the weekend. So let's see. We'll catch up probably next to next week. I think Monday or three. And yeah, looking forward to it. Love it. Cool. Thanks, man. Have a good one. Bye-bye.

31:54 - Jorge Lewis 
And sorry or not, have a good dinner. Take care. Bye-bye.

32:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, yeah.""","""30 Minute call with Nasim, AI consultan_ Transcript.txt"""

0:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Silence.

0:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Silence.

0:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hello.

0:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, how are you?

0:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Good, good. And yourself?

0:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, ready to go home.

0:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Nice. How long have you been in Spain?

0:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Nearly a month now.

1:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you learned any Spanish at least? Any more Spanish?

1:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
No.

1:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
I got a holiday that way. I don't need to think.

1:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Just a gringo in Spain.

1:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
So want to talk about streaks and milestones, yeah?

1:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yep, yep.

1:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Did you guys get a chance to read my text that I put in this morning? And does that make sense, the difference between a streak and a milestone? And a streak has two qualities, two aspects. I don't want to use the word quality.

1:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me.

1:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can say it again now if it saves time.

1:51 - Jorge Lewis 
From what I understood, a streak is just the user inputting data that's good quality or of a certain standard to the user.

2:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, it's not the standard of the data, it's the quality of the habit formed, shall we say. So for example, I was having a big debate with my sister yesterday because she was over here as well.

2:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you think about, do you know Duolingo? It's a sort of learn to speak languages app. So they have a thing where if you do something for a certain number of days, let's say like 60 learning the language, you also get these things called gems and you can spend gems to give yourself a break. Let's say like I'm going on holidays for 10 days without losing your streak. And I'm like, In habit formation, if you don't do it for 10 days, that's a proper problem, certainly in the program. Maybe in the later stages, we can look at that. But the streak is about doing something every day.

2:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, if you are supposed to walk an hour a day and you walk for one minute a day, that's also not useful because you've just walked one minute a day. If you're supposed to be eating 1,200 calories and you eat 4,000, you can record the data But it's not good data. It's not a good habit. If you're on the carb restriction, if you're supposed to be eating zero carbs and you're eating loads of carbs and you're recording it, is that useful? So I don't have an answer, by the way. The streak is the consistent doing of an activity plus the recording about that activity or habit. And that habit's actually useful. Or good, whatever word we want to use.

3:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're supposed to walk an hour a day and you walk 45 minutes a day and you record it, that's potentially good. 55 minutes a day is better. An hour is great. Anything over an hour is a bonus, right? It's brilliant. There's no penalty for going over the hour.

4:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you don't record it, well, then you'd lose your streak. And in that regard, if you're doing the habit well and you're not recording it, we want that data. So that's sort of our encouragement is to say, hey, record this, record this. Yes, it's beneficial for them that they've done the activity and the habit, but it's also selfish for us to say, well, we want that data so we can track your behaviors.

4:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then on the other hand is they're recording it every day, but they're not doing the habit very well. They're only walking for five minutes. So there's those two aspects of a streak. And then a milestone is an achievement of a certain amount. So you've walked five kilometers, you've walked a marathon, a half a marathon. Oh, you live in London. You've now walked from London to Manchester. You know, some some contextual relevant like, oh, well, I bought from London to Manchester. That's amazing. Great. And you've lost, you know, in weight, you've lost 15 pounds and you've lost five bags of sugar. You know, you were not we want to try and make it a bit more emotive and connection rather than to say you've lost three point six pounds. That's interesting. But let's convert that into something that's a bit more tangible. So there are milestones and The, um, the milestones, and I think where you were going with XP points was like the sense of the level or award. And I think some of the stuff, what I came up with yesterday is sort of more, maybe the achievements, like you're the milestone master, you're the, this, you're that, like they're badges that you can attain. You can't lose a badge. It's a badge that you have, like you just, you've just given a badge. So.

5:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you've got streaks with two aspects, you've got the milestones and badges, and we've got to figure out the right way of bringing that together.

6:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think for us, what we confused was, so to explain our first sheet, by the way, we were using the term milestone as a reward. And for us, a streak, we were thinking of rewarding the user for a streak at certain points only. Does that make sense? But realistically, what you wanted was, the streak is something that's every single day, the user gets notified, this is your streak, good job, keep it up. It doesn't have to be too prominent, but it's something that's not exactly like, oh, you reached a seven-day streak. Or, I mean, we can make, we can add emphasis on 31 days.

6:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
The streak, you're right. So streak is a little bit of game theory. It's to drive behavior of recording your data.

6:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Because if you break it, then all of that work was for nothing.

6:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, your streak would go back to zero. Now, we might give them a day's grace. We've got to do the scenario. Well, what happens if they're recording it every day? Let's just keep the scenario simple to walking, right? Let's say they're walking a day, but it's five minutes a day they're doing. They're not doing the hour. So in one aspect, the recording streak is protected or preserved. But the quality of the habit is not. And actually we care about that. It's like, okay, so you're recording. Great. Good on you for doing that. But you're not really hitting your targets. You're not really forming your habits. That's not really beneficial to you. So in that regard, you keep the streak. But I think it's a low quality streak. It's like you're never going to hit your milestones.

7:41 - Jorge Lewis 
We want to reward them for logging their data, but we also want to make sure they're doing the things that they need to do.

7:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Exactly.

7:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then milestones and badges are just certain accomplishments on distance.

8:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I can make a suggestion that we use streaks just for data entry, and then milestones for awarding good data. But I'm just saying good data as in just the what's like, you know, 55 and not five.

8:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
But...

8:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I'm assuming we have, well, I don't know, do we have separate streaks for eat, move, mind and sleep?

8:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, what do you think? I think so.

8:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think that's something that we'd have to, I think I find that very difficult to decide up front. I think that's something based on user behavior we might need to change to be one or both or four.

8:53 - Jorge Lewis 
We can speculate what would be better like for example for if we used one for each it might end up being too much like Since there's too many streaks. There's not enough value behind them Potentially it could be too noisy So like for example and then on the other side we could do it at the end of the day in the check-in Where we say hey congrats you completed all the check-in items.

9:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Here's your streak or you know, that was the original thinking but there is a certain aspect of measuring it between each four and And then obviously we need to figure out the, I just want to play this out in my head. So if you like, so every day I'm recording what I'm doing, we care about that. And then for example, if you did, if you did something every single day for the full eight weeks or whatever, how long the program ends up lasting, you could get to this level of a badge. If you miss four or five days, you're going to lose that potential to hit that milestone. But actually not necessarily because that's a streak. Milestones are distance. So if they basically did nothing for a week and then the second week they basically walked five hours a day, they could still hit those milestones.

10:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So milestones are literally just accomplishments of a distance or a weight or a thing. It's an accomplishment. It's not related to time. And streak then is a consistency. I mean, certainly if you do any UX research on the benefits of streaks and stuff like that, like Snapchat has streaks, most of them have streaks. It's about consistent behavior day on day. And I think for that is, for us, Like Snapchat doesn't give a shit whether you post a good post or a shitty post. Like people just post things like photographs of their knees. They don't care. It's just, it's their tracking engagement. That's all they care about. They don't care about the quality of the engagement where we have the

10:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes. If there's, if the street, what we don't want to do though, is have stupid sycophantic rewards going, Oh my God, well done. You, you've just done 10 days in a row of recording data. And they've walked one minute a day, like that doesn't make sense. I agree with you, a streak is the consistent logging of data, but we can't be championing and rewarding putting in like shit data, if that makes sense. I mean, because this has another dimension, we're not just tracking engagement, we're tracking habit formation. So I mean, at that point, if they're three days in, And they're tracking the data. Good. Good behavior. Well done. But we've noticed that you're not hitting your targets. That would be a coaching opportunity, or the mentor would step in and say, hey, what's going on? How do we help you?

11:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that shouldn't be going on for too long. But we need to have the most important thing is consistent entry of data, because then we understand what they're doing, whether that's good or bad. But we just need to make sure that the reward messages or the congratulatory messages around streaks are not independent to the quality of what they're doing. Does that make sense?

12:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's tough.

12:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's why I think you have a consistency metric. Are you doing something every day? And then you have a quality metric. And the message, messaging to them is a combination of those two factors. A high consistency, high quality is an awesome. A high consistency, low quality is a different message. A low quality, sorry, high quality, low consistency is a different message. And a low, low is another message. So you just have those four options of the flavor of messaging.

12:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, one thought is that it's not the streaks job, or it shouldn't be the streaks job to facilitate making sure bad data is not rewarded. Bad data should be addressed, I think the same day, or at least within two days.

13:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, all I'm saying is at the end of the day, if you've recorded data for seven days, but I don't want to have a message that goes amazing. Well done. You you're on your track to seven days streak. And they've like, yeah, but I've been eating 50,000 calories and I'm not walking a streak. Yes. Is the consistent input of data, but there's another dimension that we get, we get, we do care about the quality of their habits. So.

13:46 - Jorge Lewis 
What about we have, so for each, I wonder how the UI would look for this, but, um, for each, so what I just thought of in my head, maybe I could get, let me get my screen sharing.

14:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Hmm.

14:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is for not sure how we're going to make the UI for this, but I'm glad you brought that question up because I don't have a clue either. Yeah.

14:46 - Jorge Lewis 
A streak is going to be two things. It's going to be the day and a color.

14:59 - Jorge Lewis 
If the data is bad, we can make it something like grey. If the day is good, then we make it a good color.

15:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So their streak here is four days, but it's clear that their data was only really good for two days. And we can make these ones more appealing or make these ones look kind of like, oh, we need to improve those ones. We need less gray ones and more yellow ones. We need that urge in them.

15:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, you're getting into UX here and UI. I think, first of all, we need to agree what the foundational principles are. And so if you were to do a, um, is that a Figma jam that I've got access to? Yup.

15:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yup. Uh, I can send a link.

15:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's, uh, it's the adapt spec, is it?

15:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Just in case.

15:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

15:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what you actually have is this, so you have, um, Oh, huh.

16:07 - Jorge Lewis 
So actually for some inspiration, GitHub, do you know how the GitHub UI looks for commits?

16:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
No.

16:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So let me send, where can I, I'll send it in. So I just sent an image in the Discord, so that's how the, GitHub looks on your profile. So that's my profile. When you put a commit, it makes it green. The more commits you have, the greener. So that is, that is valuing quantity over quality, but in the same way we can make the greener, make it more saturated for the days that, you know, I think that's perfect as a report.

16:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just think, um, let me show you what I mean here.

16:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So you've got these two there and then you've got, and I can see where this is a really good UI to use for reports. You can see, okay, Tuesday's a day where we're kind of lacking every single time.

17:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and that starts building up patterns.

17:53 - Jorge Lewis 
That's going just into coaching.

18:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So did you see, can you see my, can you go to my boxes there for a second? So you can either have high, medium, low, or no for quality. I don't think streak is either. Actually, I need to change that. So for streak up here, you either have it's either done or Not done. You either input data or you don't input data. So that's the streak over here. And quality is either, do that here, is either high, medium, or low. Or no, didn't do it. And it's not done. It's entered, not entered.

19:08 - Jorge Lewis 
For the quality, do we want to be giving them four different options rather than just saying, would it be better to say, this doesn't meet your standards?

19:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, no, no. Let me just explain what that is. It's not four options. Sorry, I've just got to charge my stuff.

19:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, a streak, you either enter the data or you don't enter the data. That's very, very clear. The quality, so high for a calorie one, for example, they were supposed to do 1,200, they did get 1,200.

19:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Medium might be 1500, low might be 1700 above. No doesn't really make sense because you sort of eat that. Well actually, no might be, I didn't eat that day. I fasted all day. Okay. If it's walking, I walked an hour, I walked 45 minutes, I walked 10 minutes, I didn't walk today.

20:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So these are a spectrum and depending on the habit, the spectrum thresholds are different. And the point being that depending on the streak is one message, but the high high message is going to be awesome job. The high medium message is, hey, well done for doing it. Let's try harder to get to the high. A low message is, hey, great for doing it. More to come. A consistent set of lows might trigger a coaching event. And then a set of no's is a problem. It's like, okay, how do we help you? And not enter it on the streak is also a problem. It's like, we're not getting your data. Like what's going on? You said you wanted to do the program. What's happening?

21:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. For, for a series of, I think for, for just a series of one of these or for a series of medium, low or no, could that, could we tell the user, Hey, if we're, if we're getting more of these, you're, you're going to lose your streak, you know? So let's, let's try to, Could that be an option?

21:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I don't think you're going to lose your, this is the whole question, right? A streak is just a consistent application, but it's the, the quality of it is, is a coaching thing. And that's the thing. I mean, it's, it's a good point. Like at what point, you know, just going in and I mean, it's the same issue. I know loads of people who have problems with like things like Salesforce, cause they always just pick the first dropdown. Like they don't actually fill it in. And with all of these things, ship data in, ship data out. There's no way around that. So this is about rewarding people's behavior. We're going to assume positive intent. So the streak is about maintaining consistency of behavior and recording the data. And you really want people to be green, green or green, amber, anything that's going into green, yellow, green, red, even if it's consistent or, or pink, red, pink, anything, because we don't, if it's pink, we don't have their data. So that's a problem.

22:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's actually maybe do that as red.

22:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's green.

22:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So any combination of red, red anything, we don't know what the quality is because we didn't get the data. So red is an immediate problem.

22:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I can see, I can see where you're going, like for the streak, we can still give them the streak. Um, even though they're doing like consistent lows and then we rely on the coaching to make sure that it's, it's, you know, going to be improved.

23:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Because we don't want to like, do we.

23:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Is there a problem or downside with giving them a streak for a day that we say, Hey, we're going to, we're going to go into a coaching today because you've, you've been putting low quality data. I don't know.

23:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, I think, I think the streak, I think we have to keep this simple. I think a streak is about the entry of data. The quality of the data is a coaching aspect.

23:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
What the coaching needs to be doing is going from medium to high, from low to high. That's what the coaching needs to be doing is driving those arrows up.

24:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think that's the model there.

24:33 - Jorge Lewis 
The quality is only regarded by the agents. A streak doesn't rely on any quality.

24:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, a streak is binary. I've entered data or I haven't entered data. But any sense of messaging to the user about like, oh, awesome job, has to consider quality. So a streak is a streak, but the messaging to the user has to consider quality.

25:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sam, is this making sense to you?

25:16 - Jorge Lewis 
You're muted, by the way, if you're.

25:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hussein, can you hear us?

25:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just have one question. For example, if there is a seven-day streak and the user has stayed five high and two medium, then are we averaging whatever the higher will be we are getting the message to the user? Or what the message would be like,

25:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So streak for me, yeah. A streak is about, so you're on a Friday the first week, right?

25:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's look at this, actually.

26:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's say, no, it's not there.

26:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is sort of getting into your grid view. We're just there.

27:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is something we want to be showing and giving to the coach, I think, in an escalation or during the check-in.

27:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's all these different scenarios that you guys need to spec out. So, for example.

27:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you think I could delay this one?

27:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
The left side.

27:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe.

28:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is the agent message. You say, great job, for example.

28:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
It might be something like, Something like that, do you see that? So it's more interesting those two.

31:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so this is a milestone here, right?

31:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's the integration of a milestone coming up into the text rather than it being a separate thing. It's about because again, we want to have human conversations as opposed to transactional statements.

31:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but at the same time we want to incorporate, at least later down the line, UX that kind of makes it feel, you know, the whole gamify, like, ah, you know?

31:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, completely. That's, you know, that could be badges along the top, it could be anything, you know, hey, you're, you know, you're...

31:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like a flashy message.

31:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, generally, we know what will happen is that in the first two to three weeks, people are going to be hyper committed, and they're all going to be in the middle period, people will hit a dip. And that's where you need to be saying, Hey, listen, you're so close to walking a marathon, go go hard today. And this is the like, when you get close to a milestone is bringing that into the text as well to say, Hey, you're so close. Let's do this. Let's do this. And that's, that's the whole motivational aspect of this is really important.

32:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you're either near a milestone or you've gone past it. Because we don't do it in races. You're not actually hosting a marathon where you say, hey, you finished it. So you're very rarely to actually hit it exactly.

32:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

32:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, I'm just using the term quality. I think we can understand that it's like,

32:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

32:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so just pointing out, hey, you had a dip. What can we do to make sure it doesn't happen again? And the next day, if it's improved, great, reward that.

33:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Reward conquering it.

33:15 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you spell conquering?

33:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah.

33:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Did I get it? Yeah.

33:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

33:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So it'd be really good actually. So this is actually great. We can, let's do this again, um, for a scenario for just a different scenario.

33:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, could you use the rectangles or the squares instead of the sticky notes?

33:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sure, whatever.

33:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Whatever works. Thanks.

34:07 - Jorge Lewis 
So here we can try a different scenario where let's try So yeah, could we, could we have you go in and just fill like a lot of these scenarios in and then we can infer because that way we can.

34:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I think the whole point is, is that I start showing this and then you guys start taking, start doing out all the scenarios because as an engineer, you need to be thinking about all of these scenarios. So this is the transition. Rather than me being explicit about all of them, I've shown you the criteria. For me, when I would code, I would now take this and I would work out the different scenarios. The text is what we should be able to refine and tweak in the admin rather than having to get a precise. So it's more beneficial for you guys to start taking this on and seeing, I know I can create this. That's not going to prove anything. You guys taking this on and extrapolating out and taking ownership is that transition of knowledge, which I think is really important.

35:14 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, what else? Okay, so the streaks, so that's the streaks down. So we're going to, it's a binary value and then the coaching or the quality of it is handled by the chatbot.

35:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Very nice. Okay. So for milestones and then milestones, that one's pretty clear. Although I did have one question. So does, so when you say successfully control your calorie intake for one week, that means seven consecutive days or just in total one week, like, or seven days in total.

35:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, say that again.

35:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So when, for example, if you open the Google Sheets, the milestone thing, and in there you mentioned successfully control your calories intake for one week. Does that, is that consecutive? Like seven consecutive days?

36:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is where, this is no, this was a, based on what we've now talked about, this was a hybrid of milestones and streaks. These are badges. So, um, You know, what milestones do we have for eating or calorie if you're tracking calories? So. This needs a rethink based on what we've just talked about is the shorthand combination of both. But I think this gives you an idea for. So streaking this, you know, these could be streaks rewards.

36:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And that's what we were thinking for a streak where it's like you have, you have milestones for a streak or you have badges for a streak.

37:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Just because rather than just saying 71 days done, 72 days done, like you need to have micro achievements within the streaks as well to lock them in. Now the question is if you, become a calorie conqueror, you've done it for three consecutive days. And on the fourth day, you don't do it. Do you lose that? Or do you retain it? But you just got used to you. I think you keep it. But you've got to go again. Like if you then did another four days, you don't become a calorie controller. Because a streak is about doing something consecutive consecutively for a full week, not a week over time. Like if you did, if you did one day a month for the next seven months, you don't become a calorie conqueror.

37:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And it's, yeah. One interesting thing though, is, is using Snapchat as an example, they don't, do they have, they don't have, um, kind of levels. It's always a number. They do change. I think the, like how it looks, but I don't think they have kind of levels or like fixed points.

38:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just trying to look here.

38:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
So to maintain a streak, you need to send at least one picture every 24 hours.

38:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
And if you do for more than three days in a row, you get a flame icon.

38:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
And another flame indicates how many days in a row. So there's some interesting UX aspects that we can take from other things.

38:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Are there any apps that we could take a look at that does a good job for gamifying things for older people?

38:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Less of the older people, thank you.

39:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry. The wiser people? Experienced, I think. Experienced.

39:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's some really nice UX on this.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, very iOS UI. Hmm.

40:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so streaks we've got down, that's something we can move forward on at least. And for the milestone, so if you look at our sheet one, this is kind of where we're going with it, where a streak, So if we go to the sheet one, we can see there's a type which is streak. Or let me do this, milestone type, so it's more clear.

40:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So this can be a streak, or it can be one of these. And all of these will end up as badges, so let's just do badge text. So let me just copy one of yours.

41:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So can you see how they connect?

41:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So the criteria would be two things, the number of days of the streak, and then the quality, so the value.

42:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So I've taken two examples from the walk and put them in here.

43:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Are we using cat? What unit do you want to use for... For distance, by the way. Just what's more...

43:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
It would be different to different people.

43:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but kind of for us, what's more appropriate with the type of data we're going to be getting?

43:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Miles and kilometers.

43:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Kilometers, okay.

43:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Miles and kilometers.

43:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but just so that we can stick to one. I don't want to put miles and kilometers everywhere.

44:25 - Jorge Lewis 
It's interesting because for these milestones, there's two variables. There's the number of days that it requires and then also the quality of it. So it's how do you mix and match those is going to be interesting.

44:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you following on the on the sheet one that I'm on?

44:58 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh yeah.

45:23 - Jorge Lewis 
The XP thing, by the way, you mentioned this at the start, it's something that's pretty easy to implement, like a level system for the user. It'll 100% take fine-tuning over time, but do you want to work on that now?

45:39 - Jorge Lewis 
I think implementing a basic system right now will have benefits and then over time we fine-tune it because we will want it at some point, I think, almost definitely, right?

45:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
To find depends on the boundary between basic and not basic. But I think with all these things we need to start somewhere and then refine it to experience rather than trying to get it all right up front.

46:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly, because we need something to see where should we go. So basic as in Every user has a level. Reaching milestones gives you XP which adds up to levels or points. Let's call it points. And we can give points for a lot of things by the way. One thing that I can't pinpoint it but let me, Give me a second to think.

46:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, like for example, Discord. Some Discord groups have a bot that gives you points for every message you send. There's criteria for it, but pretty much for how active you are gives you points. So if you send a message, you might get a certain number of points. But of course, there's criteria so they can't spam. So we can probably do something similar where it kind of promotes the user to chat with this bot. I think it would be cool.

47:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Useful.

47:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to rename this sheet to Gamification.

48:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

49:04 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think, did you hear what I said regarding the points?

49:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Say that again? So Discord has a, there's a, in some Discord groups, there's a bot that rewards where you can farm levels and you get some XP points from sending messages.

49:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Of course there's criteria to prevent spam and all that but I think that would be a cool way to At least later down the road, we can give points for things like really nuanced things or just kind of small things that add to this gamification where it's like, oh, you know, sending a message, we can give points. Of course, that shouldn't be rewarded that much compared to something else. But for all these things, we can give points. So for a session, we can reward, hey, thanks for chatting. You know, you got five points from last session or something like that.

50:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe. We just wanted to get noisy.

50:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

50:18 - Jorge Lewis 
How does the format of this Google Sheet look? Sheet 1.

50:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not walk, it's move.

50:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's a sleep. It doesn't make sense. Well, I'm just going to look at move for now.

50:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it's not walked like this. That's not, this isn't, this isn't correct.

50:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's, it's, we've talked about a streak is data entry. There's you, you, you merge stuff again.

50:57 - Jorge Lewis 
This, this was from your milestone. So I just copied it over. So, I mean, but are we not giving milestones for streaks?

51:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
There is, but it's not this. It's not just walked. That doesn't make sense.

51:15 - Jorge Lewis 
you So let's work on this. How long do you think it's going to take to settle what you're dealing with?

51:58 - Jorge Lewis 
About half an hour.

52:00 - Jorge Lewis 
All right. Okay. Can you reach it back out when you're done?

52:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I'll pause that for a second. Why are you saying a streak is consecutive days walked? Because that's not what we've just talked about for ages.

52:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's the description here, which is taken from the milestones sheet, where we have walk at least for 15 minutes each day for three consecutive days. Is that something we want to know?

52:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why is it 15 minutes? It's not useful.

52:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That was from the milestones. Change it to the values that would be useful, because we don't.

52:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
What are we trying to achieve here that we don't have on the Figma gem?

52:43 - Jorge Lewis 
We're trying to get in a format that we can use for the system, like the structure of a milestone.

52:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, then you guys take what we've done on the Figma gem and create it into whatever format works for you guys.

52:56 - Jorge Lewis 
The Figma gem is for streaks. We discuss streaks only. We haven't discussed at all milestones.

53:04 - Jorge Lewis 
The milestones currently that you gave is a mix of streaks and milestones, which is like, is fine because we can reward for, we can give milestones for streaks, but there's also other things that we need to consider like total or accumulated distance, total.

53:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

53:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
This format doesn't make sense to me. I'm going to do a different sheet.

53:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Are you creating a new sheet or? I guess. Yeah.

55:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Something like that, and just flesh it out, figure it, I mean, that's the way I would do it.

55:24 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the bag of sugar here?

55:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you've lost a pound, that's a bag of sugar, or a kilo of a bag of sugar, whatever. You're just translating it into objects that the people understand, so it's an emotional concept.

55:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, okay.

55:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, you could do percentages, you can do explicit amounts, three pounds, four pounds, half a kilo, a kilo of stone, bag of sugar, you know, a football, a fucking, you know, a newborn baby, who fucking knows, like, I'm just making it emotive rather than just transactional.

56:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no, I got that part.

56:05 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just doing the same up here.

56:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And then do we want to have a milestone for an all time high? Like, Oh, you walked, you know, today you, yeah. For, for in one session where they walked the most they ever did, like a certain amount.

56:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Say that again.

56:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's one other type of, which is like an all time high where we can say, Hey, you walked, um, a new all time high and we can have a new records.

56:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
You set a new something. So records, you know, that could be on a daily basis, a weekly basis, both for weight and distance. Yeah, that's a nice idea. I don't know whether you'd call that a milestone or an achievement or a full-time high, whatever.

57:01 - Jorge Lewis 
And then for Can we build this part out of meta? I don't get what you're doing here.

57:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you mean?

57:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where are you at?

57:40 - Jorge Lewis 
On the 3-7 section.

57:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Which part do you not understand, sorry?

57:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see this part I'm selecting?

57:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

57:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, mostly this. So what is this?

57:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the street milestone for Eats for three days in, this is where you probably take stuff from the milestones page.

58:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for example, that would be a calorie conquer.

58:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Something like that.

58:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, and these are... Okay, these, okay.

59:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Four.

1:00:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Do we want to reward or have milestones for time?

1:00:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, yeah, you could say you've walked for a day, you've walked for a week.

1:00:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
You okay, brother? Do you need help with any of the shopping?

1:01:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so we'll try to fill this out. And then we'll ask you to iterate on afterwards.

1:01:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sounds good.

1:01:11 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Do you have time today later on for Chinmay to discuss kind of the check-in, end-of-day check-ins?

1:01:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
What does he need to cover on that? Sorry, I'm a bit lost.

1:01:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Pretty much just the overview. What's it going to look like, We know we can list out some things that it should do, but we'd like to go.

1:01:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because I thought this was quite extensively done in the mural before we moved to Figma Jam.

1:01:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Like the one from the original mural, you mean?

1:01:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1:01:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, we only could find, the only thing that was helpful from that mural was the screenshot we sent.

1:02:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you send me that? Sorry, because I didn't have a chance to look at that.

1:02:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I can bring it up.

1:02:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:04:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see the mural?

1:04:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
many things at the same time. So which Which part of the image do you guys, are you looking at, sorry? Can you share your screen and I can take you through it?

1:04:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:04:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you go to where my cursor was?

1:05:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so that chat there is basically a day in the life, I think.

1:05:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So is that kind of still as as how we left it before where it's just a daily video that gets sent to the user and they watch it It's not just a video.

1:05:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's, there's other content that's there. There's motivational statements, you know, there's content that there's a, there's content available on a daily basis.

1:05:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:06:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So did you look at this section when you were looking at the daily check-ins?

1:06:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Uh, no, not this one.

1:06:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So have a look at that. Then it goes down into different scenarios and

1:06:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Down here as well?

1:06:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the whole thing.

1:06:25 - Jorge Lewis 
But is this under the new system where we're doing a daily check-in at the end of the day?

1:06:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, is the check-in must be at the end of the day or how is that?

1:06:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's it's not like it doesn't check in at the end of the day. There's an interaction What I suggest is can you have a look at this conversation? See how you think this is relevant or not relevant because I I think this still stands, but you might feel differently Okay Sounds good then Well, I'll have to may look at his own because he's building out that one

1:07:17 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. So yeah, we'll keep you updated then.

1:07:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool, yeah, have a look at that and then let me know. And I appreciate you having me around as much as I would have liked to have been. I think things will settle down from Thursday this week.

1:07:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
From Thursday, okay, cool.

1:07:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I've got my son's exam results on Thursday morning, so depending how they go, my day might be a good day or a bad day. We'll see.

1:07:42 - Jorge Lewis 
We'll see. All right, thanks, Cuan, for your time.

1:07:48 - Hasnain sayyed

0:01 - Biwas bhandari 
I want to be able to see your web environment on the screen.

0:30 - Biwas bhandari 
Can you see everything? I think I can see now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so...

0:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think that's it.

0:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So let me just run the app at first.

1:46 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

2:03 - Biwas bhandari 
Nice, nice.

2:05 - Biwas bhandari 
So these are the posts that I've made, yeah, that I've faced. And this probably is not in this.

2:18 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I'm following you now.

2:25 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

2:34 - Biwas bhandari 
ok yeah this is pretty much so let me first explain the code to you and this one is for authentication and the red is for recreating server field and password and this one is for fetching code which inputs plus and filtering it. For example, if the same Read.AI ID and title is in the repository, then it will not pass it to the evaluator of the relevant data.

3:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes. Can you try improving your mic? It's very tough to hear you. Do you not have any other headset at home?

3:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me change it.

3:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe if you hold it to your mouse, it'll be better. I don't know.

3:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you hear me now better?

3:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, now it's much better. I can hear you clearly.

3:41 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh.

3:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, that's it. And for the prompts, I'm just passing the context from here.

3:54 - Jorge Lewis 
You can see.

3:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, OK.

4:00 - Biwas bhandari 
This one I just copied from the Python code.

4:09 - Biwas bhandari 
So...

Okay, so what you were working on was trying to add a button, right?

4:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. So I want to call, this one is the function that calls all the, at first it calls the, it fetches the post and it evaluates it and then tests it in the database. So this is the main function.

4:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, I see. So that function, by the way, should be called, it should be more than process posts. It's also fetching them. That name could be pretty misleading. If I see that function when I'm calling it, it's not very clear that it's processing. I would imagine since the file that it's in, for example, is in evaluation, I would think that it's not very, it's not fetching the post, but it is.

5:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so there's one concept of a spell kit and that's the server files which is, so okay, So we're not going to be able to do a lot of, it's not going to be very helpful if we do SvelteKit stuff right now because the most efficient way to do this is for you to go through the tutorials, the SvelteKit tutorials, which are great. And then once you do those tutorials, then we can do some programming because There's a very basic, well sorry not basic, but there's just an introductory concept where you have server files and then you have page files.

6:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I know, I have read about it, I cannot import the server function in the content, so I think I basically need to create a route.

6:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, exactly. But this is actually not a server function. Server functions should be inside the server folder there in lib slash server. Yeah. So you can, you can just move your file folders.

7:02 - Biwas bhandari 
I had to do that. First of all, I need to move all my folders inside.

7:14 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

7:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, if they run on the server, you probably want them, well, yeah, they need to be in the folder.

7:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

8:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye.

8:42 - Biwas bhandari 
I should have found one.

9:13 - Biwas bhandari 
the Okay.

11:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Now that insight is over.

11:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you done the tutorial?

11:37 - Biwas bhandari 
Was it failed yet?

11:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:42 - Biwas bhandari 
No. No.

11:50 - Biwas bhandari 
Hmm.

12:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

12:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye.

12:55 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay Your your gather characters out of the office just sitting but just standing there okay yeah so So there are a couple of things I need to include here in the content.

13:59 - Biwas bhandari 
People.

14:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you haven't pulled. Oh no, bro, you gotta be pulling. I don't think you've pulled yet.

14:39 - Biwas bhandari 
No, I haven't pulled yet.

14:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. You gotta always be pulling from alpha.

14:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Obviously, it depends on the project. If no one else is working on the project, it's obviously gonna be less likely, but it should be a habit that every day you're pulling, it should be on the back of your head always.

15:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Issues of... No, I think that won't work.

15:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no. Alright, so right now, we need to make a button that calls the function, right?

15:21 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, also, since I'm calling it, it's only showing post and this one, but it's not showing here. Why is it relevant or not? Why do we need to show that?

15:40 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't need that. I don't need why it's relevant or not.

15:47 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. And that's good.

15:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Like for something like that, it's the same thing when you were working on the prompts, improving the prompts. You have to understand. So this is not specific for this project. I'm trying to teach you this so that when you're working on the client's projects, it's going to be a big issue. If you're working on something that doesn't align with them, it's going to be a very big issue because for them, to them, that means that they're paying you money to work on something they don't need, they don't care about. And they're going to question your competence and your character. Why did you not ask me before? Is this important? Stuff like this, right?

16:31 - Biwas bhandari 
The relevance reason is not important to you, you are just fetching the data and putting it in the frontend.

16:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, right now, like for example, right now the current version, it doesn't have it. I don't need it right now. Because, yeah, just what I need right now is not that. And that's exactly the process it should be. You ask me in a chat, hey, I was thinking it would be useful if I had the reason why it was relevant or not, or the reason why it was relevant, then I would say yes or no. And we'd be able to move from there rather than potentially spending time on that, right?

17:14 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Okay.

17:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. Oh yeah. So let's get this button in.

17:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So open up the code and we'll go to... We'll figure it out. So which part were you struggling with? What have you tried so far and kind of where are you at?

17:34 - Biwas bhandari 
So yeah, for the bottom I have an alternative, right? If I just go to the search route, then it will automatically fetch it. I just told the sensitivity to make it.

17:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me just show you.

17:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's a search route?

18:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. In the route, there is... Sorry. These two codes are written by XAPT.

18:10 - Jorge Lewis 
If I enter, then you can see here.

18:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, because if it's fetching the duplicate post, it's not saving in the database.

18:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay, so...

18:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, if I go into the solver, it will automatically fetch all the functions.

18:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so there's two ways we can do this. We can do it the really simple way and have it fetch on the load. So, what you're doing is fetching on load, right? Yeah. You've added the functions on load. The alternative is adding it to an action. Are you familiar with actions?

18:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

18:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So an action is a spelt kind of thing that allows us to call a server function in the front end. So I could show an example. If you go into, I don't know. I mean, yeah, so I guess there's this, there's nothing inside it, but for example, it might look like this. We have, What is it, search or just do, what should we call the end point that we're trying to...

19:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, fetch post and evaluate. So this is what it looks like,

19:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold up.

20:05 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, where's my GIF co-pilot?

20:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, OK.

20:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so it takes in this, and inside here, so what we're doing is we're fetching. We don't return anything since the server function is calling on Superbase. So all we need to do is exactly what you did in the other function, which was calling this, the function, and let's just import it.

21:02 - Jorge Lewis 
It should be good. We don't need to return anything. In fact, since this is going to be a POST request... Oh no, this is a GET request. But we're not going to return anything. I guess we could. What does the fetch... Does it potentially return an F? The return is void.

21:31 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's not returning anything? Okay. So it's not returning anything.

21:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so instead of, usually I don't wrap things and try and catch. That's kind of a terrible practice to be using. There's of course the right place and right time to use it, but that's what I did before and it's great when you want something to work, but when you're trying to, now that we're integrating it into the app, If it errors, we don't want nothing to happen. We need to know it erred so that we can fix it if it's needed. So instead of logging error, we do... Because the console log error would be... It's one way to do it. So we're fetching the subreddit post and this returns...

22:19 - Jorge Lewis 
What if the Fetch subreddit, so okay, one thing I've noticed already so far is you're missing to add the potentials. Like if, for example, let's go into Fetch subreddit posts. This here. By the way, you can follow me, by the way. If you go into live share, you can click follow.

22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

22:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So this function here returns a promise of a post, right? So you're returning here. The filtered post gets taken by this and filterExisting. So none of these actually have the ability to return null, meaning if there is an error, it will return undefined. We're not considering that at all. We don't give it the option to return none. This is exactly where we want to be checking if there's an error, so Okay, so if there's fetch error, then we're going to log it But then what happens okay, so you're using another try catch okay, but yeah, especially for so what I would recommend is Taking a look at some of the other code probably on adapt would be good, but taking a look at adapt and and seeing how we handle things like this. I'll go through now. I'm no expert, so if I write something that isn't the most optimal, oh well. But at least it's not a try-catch function.

23:52 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, so we're getting the data from evaluator's mission, select.

24:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

24:03 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm just fetching it from the superweb to see if the page post from Reddit ID is already there in the superweb. If it's there, it'll filter it out.

24:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So why are we selecting title here as well?

24:26 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, both are the same. I mean, I want to check if the Read.AI ID and title are there on my page. And sometimes there will be same title, and the reddit ID might be different. For example, if you post with a title, I need advice, and I will post with a title, I need advice. Both of our titles will be the same.

24:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, how did I do it?

25:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So, why are we not using the UUID?

25:15 - Biwas bhandari 
because uuid is generated by superweb but what we are trying to compare is the post we face from Read.AI for example if you post from Read.AI it will give us reddit id title something like that it will not give

25:33 - Jorge Lewis 
us uuid So the issue that I can see here, and I think it's good that you didn't actually do what I'm about to suggest, is that the title and the Reddit ID, the Reddit ID isn't actually too unique. It's a five character long, I believe, ID, right?

25:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So by no means is that supposed to be unique. That's not the unique identifier in the program. So the case, so right here, can you explain? I actually don't know. We're checking that ID doesn't match. Oh, wait, no.

26:11 - Biwas bhandari 
No, it was just map before. Oh, yeah, this thing, yeah, yeah.

26:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, and then if there's a fetch error, but this can just always be, if there's only one function, like one super base call, we can call them exactly what they are.

26:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

26:30 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, so we can just.

26:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I can't rename, I guess.

26:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, so we're checking, we're fetching the existing submissions, and then if there's an error, we can get them, throw a new error. We don't want to be throwing, I don't think we want to throw errors here.

27:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is a question I should ask Nazif, because error handling with, well, web dev in general, but especially stock kit, is something pretty hard to get right. So figuring out, asking Nazif how to do that properly might be a good idea. So actually, I'm going to leave it here, and you can ask Nazif later.

27:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Did you make the set function?

27:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Is this built in or?

27:34 - Biwas bhandari 
No. Yeah, the third one is built in.

27:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, what does it do?

27:42 - Biwas bhandari 
It will just set it like a cassette.

27:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Like a what? Store it.

27:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Your mic's pretty muffled again.

27:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Can you hear now?

27:59 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, yeah.

28:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, this set will just store it like a cache.

28:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, your mic's again gone, it's too quiet.

28:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello?

28:11 - Biwas bhandari 
There we go, yeah, that's good.

28:13 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, the set, what this set does is it stores this in a cache.

28:22 - Jorge Lewis 
In a what?

28:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Cache, C-A-C-H-E, what do you call it? Oh, cache.

28:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

28:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see. The big problem with that is that this is a server function, so we can't be using a cache on the server.

28:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you understand how the architecture of a server client works?

28:52 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, mostly.

28:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so using that, do you understand why we can't cache on the server?

29:03 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me think.

29:20 - Biwas bhandari 
No, no idea.

29:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So the clients is the users. The server is not the users. The server belongs to all of the users. And in that way, it belongs to none of the users by themselves. So when we try to cache an individual user's or an individual client's results, that's a bad practice because we could technically... So the server is considered like a machine. It's just like a computer, right? We can store the user's results on there. But if we have 10,000 users storing the results on there, number one, is it going to have problems with scalability? Because caching is very expensive. But number two is it's a terrible practice because a server is made not to be used to store user stuff. You never want to store anything on the server. All you want to do on the server is call a function, produce an output, and return that output. That's always what a server is used for.

30:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually when you want to do caching, you add a layer of caching. So for example, so you have these, you have the clients and then you have, let me just, you have a client, you have a server sometimes, and then you have the database in between. Oftentimes you have a, so for example, before when we were using, when we were using Python, we were using Reads. Reads is a tool that allows you to cache things. So your server calls on Reads for its cache and then uses that instead of, you know, this is kind of the structure that you want to be using if you want to use caches. There's obviously other solutions. You can cache it on the clients on using local storage or something, or you can cache it using database, but probably the most, the simplest option is usually the clients using local storage is my guess. But yeah, so usually we don't want to, we don't want to, store, cache things on the server. You don't want to save any user data on the server especially. That's kind of a... Because if I save anything on the server, it's very likely that it's not safe. That's first of all. And just a whole bunch of reasons why not to.

31:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Got it. You can just add your command not to use it.

31:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so what is this actually doing here? Getting the IDs?

31:43 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Mapping the IDs.

31:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So we can just do that, right?

32:08 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the function? Is it includes?

32:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So we're checking the existing Read.AI IDs. Yeah, okay. So the problem with this, by the way, is like I said, the Read.AI ID isn't unique. So the issue with that is that maybe there's a post with the same ID. It's very rare since they're pretty, like, they're not impossible to get the same, but they're also very, like, they look very different. So it's something that we need to consider for the longterm, but for now it's fine, right?

32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So we'll leave that for now. Obviously, we shouldn't be fetching every time is the first thing, but yeah, so we can figure it out later.

32:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So existing, I guess we're getting the IDs. We're checking if...

33:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

33:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, you're checking both.

33:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

33:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Yeah, I mean, fair enough.

33:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Although, yeah, I mean, I wonder if there's ever a time where, because like, the Read.AI ID, that was random, the title, people make them themselves. So I'm wondering if, like, if I'm a person with an idea, On the subreddits, often I see that people posting very similar titles. So I wonder if we might lose something.

33:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I encountered one. It was fetching two with the same ID.

33:59 - Jorge Lewis 
But like different posts or like different people?

34:03 - Biwas bhandari 
No, I didn't check that, but I just console logged the title and two of them were the same.

34:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so people cross post, they post on different subreddits, so that would make sense. So what we could do is do check for title and user.

34:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Or even, I think.

34:26 - Biwas bhandari 
We can filter it with username.

34:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, if you check for username, we don't need the same, we don't need one user twice. That's a good point, so. So we can do.

34:40 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I should have done that before.

34:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no, it's fine. That's what we learned. So that's why it's good that we're doing this like super fast because then you learn this. If you made this system perfectly, you wouldn't, like it's impossible to kind of predict that you would make this mistake. So it's just great to make things fast. Okay, so we return new posts. If there's no new posts, so this could just be empty. Okay.

35:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it'll just be empty if there's no. Oh, yeah.

35:17 - Biwas bhandari 
If all the posts are duplicated, it will not pass anything.

35:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So I mean, if it errors, if this superbase call errors, we'll be console logging, and then we'll throw this error. But I want to just not throw that error for now.

35:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So now we're getting an error saying that this might be null, data submissions. So one common thing that we do when we're, directly after we call a super base call, we do if error to check if the error is right, but also and if the data is not null. So this way. We know that there is some data that we return. Because if it's empty, well... Yeah, because it shouldn't be... It's possibly null. Why is it saying... Is this...

36:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Is your IDE commenting that out as well? Like, erroring this?

36:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

36:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but I'm checking right here, no?

36:40 - Biwas bhandari 
I think we just need to...

36:43 - Jorge Lewis 
If error... Oh wait, no, sorry, whoops, this should be or.

36:47 - Biwas bhandari 
No, we can just... I had a question mark here.

36:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, we try not to use question marks. That's... Question marks... What question mark does is it just... That it's not null, but if this was saying it can be null, that's a totally different thing. What's the or operator in TypeScript?

37:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Is it just or?

37:13 - Jorge Lewis 
It's right?

37:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, it's like different colors, these two. It looks really annoying.

37:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, but now it's still airing. I don't know. Look, if I do this, that should stop airing. Well, no, without your thing.

37:32 - Biwas bhandari 
I want to learn this. Why is it... Okay, let's try...

37:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so...

37:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, I see exactly why so we're checking if it's not if it's null if it's null Then we're going to do nothing. We still go through with this. So Right here. We should be doing We should be returning an empty list. Oh That way we stop going through this function Okay Okay, so yes, that was why. See, if I said, okay, let me just do this here, I would have forgotten that we should be doing this proper error checking.

38:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah.

38:33 - Jorge Lewis 
And sometimes you want to move fast, but sometimes it's better to write good code. There's a balance.

38:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I do the same. Sometimes I will add a question mark even though I should be error checking.

38:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so this is returning the new post, so we'll go back to where it's been called, which was, where was it being called?

39:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, here.

39:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Here?

39:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Here.

39:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just close all the tabs, because I'm lost. Do we have the, I start always from the page.spelt, and then the server file that's calling it. Then we can go down here. So this is the main function that we're running. We're fetching this. If anything happens and it errors, it's just going to return an empty list. So I think, actually, this one, we fixed the other function, not this one. So yeah, there's a lot of try-catch. Oh, man. No, no, no. No more try-catches. I hereby ban you to try and catch.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, okay. So, okay. You're, you're doing it.

39:46 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh, what is it? Bad practice. Yeah.

39:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so what was the, okay. So for the try and catch, what do you, what do you think you're going to catch? Like, uh, what's the thought process? What are you worried that my error that we're trying to catch?

40:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Um, sometimes we can just, uh, uh, I mean, uh, wrong username and password. So it will just generate another.

40:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's go step by step. So over time, at the very start, if you're a very beginner, try and catch this faster. But at my level, when you understand how to do error checking, it's very fast. I'm not good. Nazif can do this probably in a second. It's going to take me at least a minute or two.

40:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So for fetch functions, if there's no response, it'll be a null, right? I think. Or no, it'll be an empty response. It'll give this as something. So if there's, if it's not okay, is this correct by the way? I don't know the best practice, like for, if we're checking if it's okay. I know there's.

41:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause I think there's, there's a lot of ways to check if the response did well. Let me, I'm asking co-pilot. Let's see. Yeah, it should be fine. Okay, so we're just checking if it's not okay. Error. Parse the...

41:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep.

41:28 - Jorge Lewis 
New... Whoa. This is data, data, data.

41:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Is there...

41:36 - Biwas bhandari 
No, we can just change this.

41:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think an easier way of doing this, or a cleaner way of doing this is, now don't throw any heat, but that. Nope, not that.

42:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

42:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, it's saying not okay.

42:07 - Jorge Lewis 
What is this post data object that I'm, this one here? Where is it? Sorry?

42:15 - Biwas bhandari 
That's the type for post.

42:17 - Biwas bhandari 
Yep. Did you make it yourself?

42:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

42:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it exactly the same as when you return?

42:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. I first check the response and make it. Okay.

42:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so if it, like if it's, if it's exactly the same, then we can do, we can return this data as posts as a list of posts, I believe. Um, Oh, wait, no, this is JSON, so we can do it. So I'm trying to, so the benefit of TypeScript is typing, getting the types. So that's what I'm trying to do here because, I mean, in the end here, you are getting the type as a list of posts. But I'm trying to figure out if there's a better way to do it. Usually, this is something that we should be learning in general, kind of learning how to do types.

43:24 - Jorge Lewis 
For example, Nazif, he's the most experienced web developer on our team. If he can look at our code and say, ew, then we need to improve it. That's always what I think of Of course, if I'm working on a project that's not going to exist tomorrow, then it doesn't matter, but the idea is that you learn it so that when you make a very fast project, it should be natural.

43:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So if, should this actually be, if it's exactly the same, we can cast this here. Can we not, or?

43:59 - Jorge Lewis 
I wanna see, actually, let's, I just wanna see. So I wanna, I want to see what is actually, what that looks like, Can I, can you run that?

44:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, I don't think we've set up the, I don't know if it'll actually run yet. Let's, let's, okay, let's, let's come back here. Okay, we'll come back here to fix all the types and make this code cleaner, but for now we'll finish connecting it up. Okay, so we're, we're calling, fetch, although we don't need a return fetch since fetch is a void, so we're not returning anything here actually. We actually don't even need to store it as a variable. Why are we storing void, right? Okay, so let's continue down this chain. So actually, I think this should work. We need to call it now. So we go into a page file and Here, let's find a button to attach. Let me run it locally as well, so I don't have to. Actually, I can see your screen. So I'm going to ask you to just swap to the web view every now and then.

45:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So we're here. Where can I add the button? Let's add the button inside Data Table. Because if you look at the web view right now, on Chrome.

45:42 - Jorge Lewis 
like if you look at the web on like the web the front end yeah like like on your browser okay well now you can't see it anymore but what how it is is okay let me oh I didn't finish cleaning up the code previously I left a try-catch somewhere Okay, let's fix the try-catches.

46:14 - Biwas bhandari 
Come back to me.

46:42 - Jorge Lewis 
You there?

46:50 - Biwas bhandari 
You there?

47:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello, hello?

47:04 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, hello?

47:06 - Biwas bhandari 
You there?

47:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

47:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, cool.

47:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So, oh yeah, so what I was doing, I just finished removing the try catch, because I forgot to remove the catch part. So now I should an error, I don't think so.

47:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Did it call it?

48:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, nice. Okay, so if you see the filter using ID or something, we wanna add the button on the right of that.

48:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I wanna add it on the right of that. So inside the code, what is that? Okay, here, I found the component. So this is the component that is Oh, you stopped following me.

48:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

48:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So this here is the input component. So this is a flex. Let's make it a flex row and then add it here. So we can add a button, Shadestand button with an on click.

48:39 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh, you are using Shadestand.

48:43 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm using what?

48:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Shadestand.

48:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all Shadestand here.

48:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And then inside here, what do we call it?

49:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Don't spam.

49:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't want to get my Read.AI account banned for spam. So here we're going to call the function for fetchPostAndEvaluate. So we create that up here. We'll do, yeah, okay, thank you very much. Ha ha, Copilot.

49:31 - Jorge Lewis 
But this is actually wrong, so see, that's why Copilot can't save you. It maybe saves you a lot of time, but this should actually, like, if you don't understand any of the code, then you'll be totally lost. This should be fetch, post, and evaluate. So this is the endpoint that we're trying to access through the page server file right here, so this one. And you do that by doing question mark slash to reach this end point here. Post, sure. I mean, we're not returning anything, so post works. I think it makes it more simple, actually.

50:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then string of filter value, we don't need to pass it anything. So what if we don't pass it anything? Can I just not pass it? All right. I think that works.

50:18 - Jorge Lewis 
We can just log the data, sure. I added a console log for me. Thank you. Okay, so now it should work, I think. Let's try it.

50:26 - Biwas bhandari 
Let's give it a go.

50:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so it did call it properly. So let's check out the object.

50:49 - Biwas bhandari 
I think we need to remove that. Sorry? Giving us this error. It's OK.

51:19 - Jorge Lewis 
form actions expects form encoded data okay so what do we do is we're going to google it go ahead all right this is all you I'll guide you with my experience but I want to see how you solve this this bug so we have a bug that we've never seen before pretend pretend like i've never seen it and now you're going to tackle it I think I just need to now if it will But you have hot reload on, you don't have to refresh the page.

52:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

52:09 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so my tip here is you have no clue what this is saying, what the error is saying. The error tells you the problem, but you have no clue what it's telling you. So what do you do? You Google. Or you try GPT? I would use probably Google.

52:30 - Jorge Lewis 
The annoying thing with Spellkit is that there's not a lot of resources on it, and it's a really new framework, so try GPT isn't as good with Spellkit as it is something like React.

52:44 - Jorge Lewis 
You're using Tmux or?

52:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you able to copy and paste from the terminal?

52:52 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, yeah.

53:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see the issue. I think.

53:10 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

53:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, but... Yeah, I mean...

53:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I'm gonna fix the issue to check if I understand it. Okay, can you run it again? I think I fixed it.

53:29 - Biwas bhandari 
Don't look at the code.

53:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Did it not work?

53:44 - Jorge Lewis 
It shouldn't even be, why is it erroring now?

53:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you refreshed the page?

53:56 - Biwas bhandari 
No.

54:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, is it saying? Yeah, what the heck?

54:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, it's lagging.

54:43 - Biwas bhandari 
Alright, I'm gonna go get a coffee, I'll be right back.

54:48 - Jorge Lewis 
You can continue working on this for now.

54:54 - Jorge Lewis 
By the way, I can see, I know the error now, but I'll leave you to solve it, you got this. If you want a hint, it's related to how the...

55:07 - Jorge Lewis 
It's related to, it's not SpokeKit specific, it's post versus get requests. Like what's the difference and how do they work? So that's their tip.

55:36 - Biwas bhandari 
laptop is lagging what? What?

56:05 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, hello?

57:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

58:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you found it?

58:14 - Biwas bhandari 
No idea.

58:15 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so it's not actually, it's a very expected bug, like it's not unexpected. So how I would go about this problem is I would read the error. So let's go back to the error.

58:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

58:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So the error says, Svelte kit form actions Okay, yeah. I think I got it. But...

59:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's going to be very hard for you to solve this.

59:44 - Jorge Lewis 
if you don't understand to a basic how, the basics of how posts and get requests work, and kind of how those work. So what we're saying is a header is kind of to define how the, kind of defines the rest of the function, I guess you could say.

1:00:13 - Jorge Lewis 
provides additional, like it tells the server or whatever we're interacting with about the request that we're making. So in this case, the content type we're telling it is we're passing you this type of content.

1:00:30 - Jorge Lewis 
But we're in a post request, so we're telling it, so beforehand, by the way, so this is actually supposed to be JSON. We're usually passing it JSON, but the reason So we're telling it, OK, the content type we're going to pass you is JSON. But we're not passing it at anything, because I deleted the body request, the body of it. We told it, hey, we're going to pass you JSON, but we're not returning any JSON.

1:00:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's either we can just give it empty data, and that works. Or I believe there's a content type that's kind of empty.

1:01:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me see. So the option is, we don't need to pass it any data. We don't need to pass the function anything. So either we can pass it something empty, or we could figure out if there's a content type that says empty. But I don't think there is. So what we'll do is we'll pass it an empty JSON.

1:01:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, and now it should work. Oh yeah.

1:01:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, there might be an error, but not with the actual, uh, request.

1:01:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:01:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you, have you clicked it again?

1:02:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

1:02:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I was from the error was like 26 minutes, three 26.

1:02:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, now it's 27 already.

1:02:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So click the fetch post, yeah?

1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Is that the error? That's the old error.

1:02:21 - Biwas bhandari 
Is it being clicked or not?

1:02:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Why isn't it not being clicked?

1:02:30 - Jorge Lewis 
That maybe means there's no error.

1:02:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Or nothing's happening, or what?

1:02:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh my, your laptop is just...

1:02:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, but yeah, the get request is... The post request is getting sent. Let's retry.

1:03:00 - Unidentified Speaker

0:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you hear me?

0:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

0:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

0:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. So let's tease apart what's going on. So where are we? Obviously, there's the self-inflicted pressure in terms of we had expectations and hitting that. Is that where you or is there something in how I am or we're engaging with you that's putting more pressure on you guys or?

0:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's definitely the self-inflicting part, which is we want to impress. That's on us. The solution to that one is just start sharing our dev chats to you. And that way, we have no pressure. It's just you're getting the full behind the scenes. But then there's also, I mean, if that solution solves the other issue, which is that you're constantly asking for updates, then that's a perfect solution. But if it still doesn't, you require more like daily explanations in terms of what's going on. And then it does feel like, it feels like you're expecting deliverables every day.

0:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So definitely not expecting deliverables every day.

1:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I've been doing product delivery for 25 years, so I know that's unrealistic and it's not useful.

1:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think when, for example, if I said to you, I'm going to give you 10 pounds on Friday, And then on Wednesday, I know that that's not going to happen. Me telling you straight away and saying, listen, sorry, that's not going to happen. Here's why. Here's what we're going to do about it. And here's when you're going to get it. That's what I mean by managing expectations. So as soon as you understand that something can't be done, it's setting those expectations of, hey, And let's be candid about it. This isn't going to happen. Here's why. I get software changes. But this is when you are going to get it. And this is what our confidence is. Yes, obviously, things can slip again. We get that. But at the moment, from my point of view, there's a huge amount of trust on my side that I'm assuming you guys are working. I'm not seeing stuff that I can play with. I feel from my side, I've tried to lean in and say, OK, Let's get this sort of visual contract of saying, I want to be able to do this. When can I get this thing? And that was supposed to be last Friday. And listen, I get stuff happens, and it's technology. It's never 100%.

2:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I think you're hitting on a really big point that's a part of this, where we don't acknowledge that you understand that software has delays. And we're trying to probably make up for it or compensate for it with just delays. So knowing that you truly do understand how software development is, then it does give us a lot more freedom to just say, yeah, this is what went wrong.

2:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that's more real. I'm not saying it's particularly any more pleasant, but it's more real. And I think it understands, you know, hey, we thought this plugin was going to work. It doesn't work at all. And we've lost a day. It's not great, but shit happens. And we get that.

3:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's better that you know that rather than us just saying, oh, sorry, it's going to be a day later.

3:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because it's just like, Were you on the beach? Did you get hung over? Like, there's no, there's like, we don't know. Right. And obviously I'm speaking with JP and ARIF every day. And they're like going, Hey, cause when you tell me there's a demo on Friday, I'm obviously relaying that boat to the other ADAPT founders, but also to ARIF and JP, because they want to know how it's going and what my point of view is and what you guys are doing before they put their money into it. And, You know, I mean, listen, I think we both recognize that you guys are not a 400 person company. And that's one of the reasons why we like you guys, because we like your personality, we like your drive. And that's why we'd be interested in sort of partnering with you, because I think we can significantly add value to you guys and help you elevate your game. I think there's a three-year window to do something really, really interesting together before AI changes the landscape altogether and scares the shit out of everybody. But I think there's a short-term window to do something really interesting and impactful in the world with this tech. I just think we're fighting a tide of expectations. I was just on a webinar earlier on with ServiceNow, and they're unhelpfully putting out narratives that, you know, you can improve productivity by 70% with AI. Yes, if you want to use builder.ai and you say, give me a clone of Instagram or give me a clone of Facebook, yeah, it's an established pattern. As soon as you want to do something innovative, I'm sorry, you can't just go to software, hey, make this thing. It might come one day. I was watching an article last night saying that there's a multi-agent coding solution which has a test bot, a reviewer bot, coder bot, and they're giving each other's feedback. And it keeps on getting, the coder will keep on getting it wrong and keeps on getting feedback until it gets it right. And so that's quite clever.

5:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Was it called Devon?

5:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Could have been, yeah.

5:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Devon's very impressive.

5:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
But again, a lot of these things are happy path, right? So that's why I was asking you guys, what are you seeing? And yes, obviously you don't have the inefficiencies of large organizations, But I do wonder whether there is a conversation to say, like, how do we manage expectations? Like, could we use AI to manage expectations saying, hey, you know, not that it's of any value whatsoever if you know what you're talking about, but to say, hey, there was 7,000 lines of code written today. There was 15 check-ins. There was five issues. There's even something similar to that. We know something's happening. I don't put in particular, that doesn't mean the needle has shifted, but it does mean activity has happened. So that would be hygiene. I think the evolution beyond that is to say, I was reading a good article about the difference between a roadmap, a product roadmap, and a flight plan. Flight plan has to change the dynamics in the weather and stuff like this. And you have the ultimate goal, but your path there is evolutionary, and it responds to dynamic changes and stuff. So I built myself an hour if we did our first startup years ago, about 15 ago, which was building an AI project manager. We got gazumped by JIRA and Azure DevOps and stuff like that because we just couldn't because we had to use our underlying database and people wouldn't let go of Jira and DevOps because they were so integral to the solution. But people said, well, can you give us the bot? We really like that. So there's a lot of thinking that we've done. And again, another experiment to figure out is after we built this is, could we build an AI project manager to lighten your load from an account management point of view? I think there's some really interesting stuff we could do there. But that's another phase. So on this in particular, you asked some really interesting questions yesterday. And some of them makes total sense. And some of them felt that we weren't aligned, or I don't understand how the coding requires that sort of information. I think I had a preconceived idea of it working a different way. So can you sort of give me an update of where we are with stuff and how close we are to getting it in the next release so I can play with stuff?

7:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, how about I run you down and where the architectures are right now so you get an idea of what it's doing behind the scenes.

8:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just give me two seconds. I want to see if Arif and JP are around. They might like to hear this.

8:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll just give them this meeting link. If they can join, they can join. Um, okay, cool.

8:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm trying to try to post the, I had a drawing. Let me find it there.

9:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Or I think of, yeah. Okay, so can you open up that PDF you sent? It should have been an image, but yeah.

9:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just screenshot and send it. Where did you put it?

9:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because I just got read...

9:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm hearing beeps but I'm not entirely sure where this is.

9:41 - Jorge Lewis 
It's in the dap channel.

9:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
In this? Or in... No, it's in adapt. Sorry, it's in that. Okay, fine.

9:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is it?

9:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, supervisor, entry coach, entity, supervisor, select next, speaker, tool, coach. What's that drawing platform that you use?

10:08 - Jorge Lewis 
The one that you share?

10:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Excalibur.

10:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that would probably be better in there because it's typing some of the text.

10:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sometimes when I'm really in the brain, like the whiteboard, I need the drawing.

10:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I get that. But okay, let's not start with the architecture because that's an implied thing that you need. Hey, JP.

10:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Good morning.

10:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, so where are we with the actual feature set going backwards from the customer, from us? When do you think I'll be able to play with it? We talked about a potential demo today. Is that feasible?

10:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I'm doing currently right now is trying to, so from Friday when we had the demo, what we had was the check-in bot specifically. So behind the scenes, they're split up into different modules. They all have the same persona, so they act like the same person. But behind the scenes, they're each specialized to do one thing. And in our case, I was working on the check-in bot. The check-in bot is comprised of the coach, data analyst, and the supervisor.

11:20 - Jorge Lewis 
So the supervisor, his job is to gather the data, then he sends it to the coach to provide coaching on the data that's given from the user, and then he can get further analysis from the data analyst if he wants or not. And then it goes back to the supervisor to repeat the loop. So that's the check-in thing, and that's what I was working on.

11:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is a multi-agent system?

11:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's evolved into that. I don't know if we're going to call it... It is a multi-agent system, but I don't know if we're going to call that because an agent is often, it can be defined as someone like with a persona. So we don't know yet. Behind the scene, it is very similar.

11:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

12:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So a multi-agent system to the customer or the user would have an experience of working with three different people. But under the hood, what we're saying is it's one unified person experience, but there will be sub bots, sub agents, let's say, call them sub agents that are working together to achieve a particular outcome. And so you're niching up the capability into really thin slices so they can become experts in that one thing.

12:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Exactly. Yeah. And the reason so by Friday, what I had was I had one bot that had the capabilities to retrieve data from the database, get data from the database, and then provide some some coaching. But the performance wasn't that good. The one guy couldn't do it all. So we went into this route of delegating.

12:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
When you say performance, that's got multiple interpretations in terms of speed, in terms of accuracy, in terms of experience.

12:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so speed is actually a very annoying thing because right now it's currently quite slow, but for the performance I was referring to was just the quality of Alpine didn't think it would be able to become I feel like if we modified the prompt, it wouldn't be able to, it's not flexible because we tell it to change one aspect. Let's say for your coaching, do this, do more of this. Then having it integrated within the entire bot, it's not a good idea because by separating them, we get to independently improve one of the modules. It would mess up the function calling quite a bit because function calling is surprisingly pretty difficult for language models. So separating that is usually the best idea. It gives us the most scalability in terms of capabilities and quality.

13:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So for me, there's a milestone I'm looking for, which is to have a version of the bot that we can interact with, pull in data from a profile, and then changing the foundational prompt so that that bot can change its responses to certain scenarios. Because that, I think, is going to give us more learning in terms of all the different types of edge cases of how people engage with it. So that was what I thought we'd have on Friday, and then it was talked about potentially today. So when do you think we can actually play with that?

14:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me keep going into the progress we've made so far, and then we can wrap that. So from Friday, that's what we had, the single bot trying to do everything. And then over the weekend, I worked on it. And by that point, we had the UI completed, but the reactivity was terrible. You'd have to refresh the page every new message just because of the way the backend was connected. Over the weekend, we fixed the reactivity, and I implemented the multi-agent architecture.

14:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So just some feedback, by the way, especially to myself and Arif, because we are quite technical, giving us that level of granularity, saying, hey, listen, we've got this bit done, but the reactivity was really, really shit. That's fine. We would then understand that that's a realistic issue and a glass ceiling you've hit, and then say, hey, while functionally it hasn't improved, we've re-architected it to sort out the reactivity blocker. That's huge progress for us. Even though it's not getting us to the ultimate goal that we thought we'd get on the Friday, but we can understand that level of reality with dealing with software. It goes backwards and forwards and left and right. So having that transparency, I think, is really, really useful. JP, what about you? I know you're a clever guy, but I don't know whether that level of feedback is something that you'd want or not.

15:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
I pick up little bits, and I learn as I go.

15:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Over the weekend, we improved the reactivity and then I improved the bot system. By yesterday, I had finished what I was happy with in terms of architecture. Today, my plan was to fix the prompts to make them more aware of their environment. So pretty much tell them, hey, you're part of the system. You shouldn't have your own persona. You're part of this guy, right? All these things, and just improving the prompts here and there.

16:12 - Jorge Lewis 
By the way, to kind of give you some more context regarding prompting, there's one type of prompt, which is for the persona. And then there's another one that's for functionality. The functionality one is behind the scenes. The persona one is going to be editable by you guys. But I'm trying to figure out a way if we can make even the ones behind the scenes editable for you guys so you can iterate those ones as well.

16:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that would be certainly from an Intelli agent one for JP. I feel that's probably where you're going to need to go because we can't specify the functionality to the end degree. So having an interface that we can modify the functionality while also the style of the personality, I think having those two levers would be super useful.

16:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

16:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
On the sort of the agents and having sub-agents, is there a sense that If the supervisor buzz goes left, even if you want to go right, you must listen to them. Is there a hierarchy of opinion, for want of a better word, in the bus? Otherwise, how are they going to stop? I think you called it a circle jerk. How do they not just get into a really nasty cycle of saying nice things to each other?

17:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So in the one for Adapt, there's not much hierarchy. The flow is usually very simple. So it's going to be gather the data, coach on the data. To coach on the data, he can pull more insights from a data analyst or not. But for something like for JP's one where it's sometimes have a circle jerk, just you have to allocate who has priority and who doesn't. But on top of that, the supervisor in Adapt's case is also the check-in manager, but his main role isn't to manage the conversation. His main role is to get data and then pass it on to the coach to provide coaching. So we could further add another layer on top, which is just a pure supervisor just saying, this is how the conversation should look like, If it looks like there's a power struggle, do this or this.

18:20 - Jorge Lewis 
So if we go into the graph.

18:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I shall send it. Can I send images here?

18:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
I should.

18:39 - Jorge Lewis 
How do I?

18:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, let me let me screen show you this.

18:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you guys see it? Yep. So at the top here, we have the supervisor, but this is also- Can AI rewrite the writing?

19:07 - Jorge Lewis 
We can. Let's see. Thank you. Thank you. See, I did try doing it in Excalibur, but sometimes I need the drawing of the whiteboard. Let's see. I know there's AI features.

19:26 - Jorge Lewis 
No. Oh, wireframe to code.

19:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, supervisor is going to start us off. So if the user says, let's check in, the supervisor starts off. The supervisor and the coach both have a tool to select the next speaker. This is to pass the baton to the next person.

19:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that the next sub-agent?

19:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
The this one or we say speaker is that the person that the sub agent bot that's engaging with the customer person.

20:01 - Jorge Lewis 
This, this, this is a tool. So tools are, are just for the language models to call and for us to manage behind the scenes, like to allocate who should speak next. Right. So the blue ones are tools. They're not real people. This one's also supposedly a tool, the entry. So let's just go step by step. So the first one is he can select, all right, we've got some user data. Let's select the coach to speak next. So we'll start the coach off. This node here is just to introduce the coach to the scenario, saying, hey, we have this new data. Let's coach on it. And then we start into it. The coach can then select the next speaker, which could be the data guy or go back to the supervisor.

20:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So this entry node is also just telling the data guy the context of the conversation so far. The solid lines, by the way, are non-conditional. So anytime the conversation is at the data guy for one message, he gives a response, and it'll go directly back to the coach. The dotted lines are conditionals, depending on some factors. And then after the coach maybe makes some coaching, he hands it back to the supervisor, and we usually repeat.

21:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just going to hide my camera because I'm going to start eating and I don't think any of you need to see it.

21:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I wouldn't mind.

21:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes. So that does that make sense? Albeit the beautiful handwriting.

21:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, it does. But I suppose the real challenge is in the nuance of testing it.

21:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because it all looks fine on paper.

21:42 - Jorge Lewis 
When do you think we can actually start to like So let's so Jonas has been working on the front end side of things So this so this is you guys can still see my screen, right? Yeah. Yeah. So for example, I could select my chat and See, we had an issue this morning. I was working. I spent way too long trying to fix this issue. We're sending to the same messages, but, um, so yeah, we have the conversation going now, but I need to push the changes that I made today.

22:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Could you, could you explain this? I think it's really useful context for us. So that we can understand, for example, if you're doing normal software engineering and you say you pass in two variables, like two numbers, and the addition of the number is the function of the module, 1 plus should be equal to 2. It always will be. Obviously, LLMs and this sort of work is a bit more fragile in that way. It's not as canonical or categorical. Can you explain to us why it started producing double responses and how did you fix it? I think this will just go a long way for us to start understanding the realities of software engineering in this way, that it's not quite the same as building a website.

22:55 - Jorge Lewis 
This was actually not the language model. It was something related to the code, our code.

23:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So the language model was giving you a single response, but for some reason you were displaying it twice?

23:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, yeah, no, well, this, this is my, our side. So the right side is us. So this is me saying I'm 24 years old.

23:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So the UI is doubling what you said.

23:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Not even the UI. Behind the scenes as well, it was making two of the same messages. So for some reason, the bot would respond with one nice message. Perfect. But then the R side would keep putting two. And I finally fixed it. If this doesn't duplicate, I've done it. And it didn't duplicate.

23:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, so I think as soon as I push, I need to ask Jonas, because as soon as I push or merge my changes into the alpha branch, it'll be deployed. But I don't know if it'll work as is. So I need to check with Jonas on that one. But there's also, I don't know how good it looks at the moment, but let's take a look.

24:01 - Jorge Lewis 
There's the admin link somewhere. Let me find it.

24:08 - Jorge Lewis 
We've separated the chat interface, or we've made them into two separate projects so that, I mean, it doesn't make a difference on the user side, but for us, it makes it a lot easier to work with.

24:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Next task.

24:26 - Jorge Lewis 
What should we do?

24:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Eggs and bacon, Kevin? Eggs, bacon, avocado, six eggs. Six pieces of bacon and half an avocado.

24:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Sounds like...

24:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can't find the link.

25:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
It is interesting, though, that compared to using chocolate-covered, cream-filled eclairs or profiteroles, You can't quite eat the same number of eggs.

25:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's amazing.

25:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So yes, the admin page looks like this now. So you can review the responses. So this is the top dropdown is for you to select which user you want to go through. So let's just say mine.

25:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's say this response wasn't that good. You can click on it and you can select if it was a good or a bad response. If it was good, it takes us to this page where it's just the form. So this was the response we deemed as impressive. What was good about it? Where should the conversation... I think this part, I think we were supposed to ask you, but we didn't. Should a good, impressive response have a following field here?

26:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me ask JP and Ira from this, actually. So the reason why I came up with this idea was not just the response, but where do you want the conversation to go after that response? Is there a particular direction you need to take it away from where you think you're going at the moment?

26:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
For example, let's say someone says, oh, I didn't do my walk because my kid went to hospital. And they said, oh, I'm really concerned to hear about that. That's a good response. But where do you actually go next? Do you go back to the previous point? Or would you say, actually, given this is a highly sensitive topic, do you actually now want to say, shall we pause this check-in and come back to you tomorrow?

26:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's that sort of stuff. That was the point of the follow-on. So you've got the immediate response, which is good, which could include a follow-on. But if it doesn't explicitly have one, the follow-on was, as a person, this is where I would go next.

27:01 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, OK. That makes sense.

27:03 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, it's probably.

27:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Up to the user you pose the question. Yeah, I think you're right. Are you okay to carry on today? Or do you want to just pick this up again tomorrow with the clear ahead? Yeah Because I'd imagine doing a marketing thing there's particular Sort of non-logical next steps that jp goes. Uh, if I saw that I'd want to go left or I'm like, oh fuck I would have gone, right?

27:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, that's the communication of your expertise completely that that's it's imperative that we direct them so that they don't decide what to do themselves, so to speak.

27:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Language models are very, what they do is predict the next set of text. They're very bad at skipping a step and going from the results to Like, if they're given the endpoint, it's very hard for them to try to reach it through messages. They usually just go straight to that point. So we'd have to, we should gather the data right here, we should gather the data, and we'd later end up finding a way to make it in a way that the language model would enjoy using.

28:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is it possible, for example, let's say you're running a workshop, And that workshop could be broken down into, have you ever heard of a business model canvas workshop?

28:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Canvas workshop for the business model.

28:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, a business model canvas is like a 12 box diagram of different steps. And there's a particular, there's an effective way that you travel through those steps. And so is there a way that we can create those steps that they must be finished. And then the steps must happen in that order, but the journey to go from step one to two is what's organic, but you have to get to two before you can start talking about three. Yeah.

29:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. That's actually something similar to what we're doing for, for these sub modules. Cool.

29:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So this function here is to select the next speaker within the check-in cycle. So I've given it the standard check-in cycle looks like, The supervisor, he requests user tracking data, the coach gets it from the supervisor, the data analyst gets user from the tracking data, and then tries to provide useful insights. The coach uses this to create some coaching, and it's back to the supervisor. So giving it an example of the orders that we want is usually enough for it to understand how things go. And then sometimes, depending on how well we prompt and the examples we give it, it'll be able to do it pretty well, in between, I mean. Going from one to another, it does a good job.

29:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Those sort of five points, I'm sorry, I think from an IntelliAsian point of view, being able to see those and add to them or change the order of them, I think is going to be imperative.

30:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sorry, excuse my ignorance, where are they sitting, those five points, as far as, it's in the code, obviously, at the moment, but where, as far as a user interface, is it part of a hard-coded prompt or is it something that's modifiable?

30:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's modifiable. We can bring it to the front end and bring it here. But this is a simple one where there's no variables. But something more complicated like this one where we have variables like a profile ID. Or actually, let me go. Yeah.

30:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
I want all of these aspects of a prompt to be in an admin screen that we can tweak and modify.

30:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so we need to figure out the best way to do that because it's obviously possible. Just what's the best way? I'm thinking the best way is just to use So you can see here, we give it a variable. This is a variable here, userInfo. And at the bottom, we give it as the actual value.

31:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I can't see your screen anymore. Is it just me? No, I've lost it as well.

31:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, for just now or the whole time?

31:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, just now. Just now.

31:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me know.

31:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, we're back.

31:42 - Jorge Lewis 
OK, so this part here, so this is a prompt for creating an agent. So we're passing it the user info, which is things like name, those things, right? It's given as a variable using the curly brackets. And then we set the value down here in the code. So we could, on the front end for that, make the curly brackets as a keyword for variable. And we need to tell you guys to not change those. That's the simplest way I can think of as of now. Later down the line, to make it more intuitive, we can make a drop, like an insert variable type of thing. But I don't think there's a need. We can use double curly braces if that's more intuitive and obvious.

32:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
I would just create a CRUD screen with those fields in it that we can edit. And then at runtime, you pull that down.

32:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the risk of going into code and changing something accidental is way bigger. So anything that's changing stuff, I would want to control the experience just to be safe.

32:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, the only one of the problem for the crud table you'd be so we would assign the variables, right? On the UI. But the value would have to be assigned later down the road.

33:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Once you spin it up, that will pull down the latest value, and then we'd have to have some form of... If you changed it, it would have to refresh. Let's say you changed the personality variable. It would have to then take that new personality, so maybe there's a restart, a reboot, refresh, whatever. There has to be a way of pushing that change into the bot context so that it takes that new context into consideration going forward.

33:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the concern is that so user, so let's say if we were to just drag this into a front end, we have the left side of the screen can be the prompts with the right side just being the variables. We can't assign the value in the admin page. It has to be done behind the scenes. So it has to follow a certain key. For example, the key would be user info.

34:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think we need to fix it now, anyway.

34:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we can go into that.

34:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when will this be deployed? Because it looks, you know, it's great to see this. It looks like it's actually, there's a whole load of stuff that's happened. When can we start to play?

34:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I could try pushing right now, if you guys want to see if that will work or not. Actually, never mind, we have a problem with Vercel. They've changed their pricing or their integration with GitHub. Only Jonas, oh, wait, no. Let me give it a go. Only one person from the accounts can now merge into Alpha. Let's find out.

35:07 - Jorge Lewis 
But I mean, yeah, I think Jonas is off for today. But if he's able to respond to my message, I can get it done myself.

35:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it doesn't let me.

35:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
How come he's away today? Sorry, I didn't know.

35:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry. Jonas, I think he's just off for dinner with his girlfriend's family.

35:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so if you can get a copy of it and let us know when you can push so we can test it because...

35:42 - Jorge Lewis 
He's off for my day. His day starts at the normal time. I start late.

35:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I can get him back on.

35:54 - Jorge Lewis 
But if this doesn't have any issues, like with the actual connecting with the front end when it's merged, then it should be...

36:03 - Jorge Lewis 
10 but it takes as long as Jonas can respond.

36:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So we've looked at the good response. Let's take a look at the bad one. Similar thing.

36:18 - Jorge Lewis 
The system prompts.

36:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So now we've separated the prompts into different aspects to give you guys some more room to work with. And this will later be the whole list of prompts that we're seeing that aren't added, like the system prompt for agents and things like this. So we'll add that later down the road. As of now, you can start playing with these. Yeah.

36:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So does that include everything you guys were wondering, or have we missed anything?

36:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, yeah, we need to figure out what we can do. And yeah, if you can send over the latest URLs that we need to play with, and then we can start playing with stuff and giving feedback, that'd be great.

37:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, sounds good. And then just to solve the issue of the daily progress is we'll start moving a lot of our tech chats into your guys' chats, or maybe we'll make a separate channel for us to put the tech-specific stuff, and we'll start just chatting there. Sound good?

37:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

37:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. I'll send the links right now, and then I'll let you know when they're playable.

37:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
Just just let you know as well the payment went through today so it should be in your account now Sounds good.

37:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks so much I hope you could I've hope you've been able to see how we're able to apply some of the coins a lot of cool and stuff to To the most yeah that we're using well behind the scenes. We're using line graph. It's a pretty pretty new framework for for just LLMs. It uses a graph structure, which makes it super modular and flexible. I love it so far. It was different to what we were previously using, which was another framework by Microsoft Autogen, which was a lot more abstracted and less easy to work with. So this one hopefully gives us a lot more just grit and speed. Excellent.

38:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool you.

38:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Thanks guys so much for your time. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.""","comms management & adapt demo Transcript (2).txt"

Wed, Aug 28, 2024

0:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let me share my screen so that when someone is watching this, they understand what I'm talking about. All right.

0:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let's start from the top. So this is the division mission workshop for content.

0:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's make sure we're on the same page. So today we're just going to align on those two things. Here's a quick example of what the vision and mission are. The mission is explaining why are we trying to build this? What problem is it solving? And then what is the solution? So building an online platform to solve this problem. So yeah, so let's get into the mission. So with a mission, what we'll do first is have me say off the top of my head, the problem we're trying to solve.

1:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So, PO, project owner, will explain how the idea behind the project was conceived, what problem arised that gave him the idea of IntelliO.

1:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so the project was conceived because the past two weeks or three weeks I have spent a lot of effort and time into writing, trying to write content, but haven't gotten anywhere.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Number one, I like writing, I like that aspect, but it just takes too much time to write things on paper or on Notion or whatever, to put things down.

1:51 - Jorge Lewis 
It takes a lot of mental effort and time to get those onto paper and then into a script or whatever.

1:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So like I've tried writing content and just hasn't worked out I have time for it, but I just I'm I guess I'm It's too much effort I guess you could say I have better things to do than writing content

2:11 - Biwas bhandari 
or at least yeah But if content yeah sometimes you feel like, okay, I want to write about this, but you cannot start writing in the copy about all the scripts.

2:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a form of writer's block, but also, yeah. Kind of procrastination, but it's like I have better things to do. I'm not I'm gonna save this for later. So procrastination Okay, so with that said let's take just two minutes to notes our interpretation of what I just said and then What the mission is I think you've already done it, but if you want to try again Yeah, I think my one links with your Alright, I've got mine.

3:23 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, yeah. I finished mine too.

3:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, so Marina, why is yours the same color?

3:30 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me change it.

3:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, thanks.

3:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let's read yours. So the project owner will usually read his out first, I believe. Reduce time and efforts required to write content. So that's what I put. And for yours, the mission of the product is to help make content and brainstorm about it. The problem is, is it takes a lot of time to brainstorm about the content I'm making and the current AI tools congeneration is not it. Okay, that's perfect. Your one's great.

4:03 - Biwas bhandari 
No, yours one is like my summarized form.

4:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so one thing we noticed in the last one when we did this with Jonas was his was too many things. So...

4:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so we'll take your one. Let me copy it. And then what we do is we bring it here, and we get a new note, and we put the mission.

4:41 - Jorge Lewis 
And under, the mission. Okay, so we can shorten here. So the mission of the product is to help make content um creation and ideation so ideation is the brainstorm part um faster and or is to make it easier so faster and less mental effort okay because that's that's the problem okay So this part's a good point. The current AI tools for content generation is not good, but I don't think it doesn't belong in the mission. So I'll just bring that over and paste it somewhere here.

5:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so the mission of the product is, so we don't have to say this, so help. So, or not help, just make content creation, content creation and ideation, Why is it saying ideation is not a word? I think it is. Yeah, it is. It's the formation of ideas or concepts, but all right then, buddy. Make content creation and ideation easier, faster by requiring... Okay, just by making it faster and require less mental effort. Okay, cool.

6:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Now on to the vision. So P.O.

6:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Afterwards, P.O. And then P.O.

6:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So P.O. Will give a high level explanation of his idea and vision of the project. Afterwards, I'll invite everyone to write down their motivation behind working on the project.

6:56 - Biwas bhandari 
Can I invite everyone? What do you mean?

7:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just going to tell everyone. All right, everyone, let's do this now.

7:08 - Jorge Lewis 
After everyone is done, we'll collaborate, collaboratively compare all the ideas. Yeah. Okay. So. The vision, so this is really, this is great when you have a lot of like more than a few people. When it's two people, it's, it's very fast and there's only two things. So it's not too much to worry about, which is why I asked Jonas if he could join, because he could give more input. So.

7:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So the idea, so what I imagine this is, and the vision is kind of the end goal of this entire project. It's not a It can be like the very end goal. So for example, for, for adapt, it could be the vision is a chatbot can help coach the user to build habits.

8:04 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

8:06 - Jorge Lewis 
To build good habits. I think that's it. That's the vision. A chatbot building good habits for users.

8:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. How we do that, there's a lot of different ways, but that's the end goal. The chapel will help users build habits. So for this one, what I think, what I like this project to become, well, is I can sit, so I'm going to kind of just draw a story. So I want to wake up, have my coffee. And this is when I usually like to write or do my creative things. Cause I'm just, I've got my coffee. It's morning. I want to be in the chair and just.

8:41 - Jorge Lewis 
like have content there that I just refine. So content is generated and I can refine it. And that content is something I agree with. It's in the style that I like, It doesn't sound like AI at all. And to convert it into an actual post or script, it's not a lot of work. Meaning I only have to change some small things. It doesn't have to be perfect, of course. Well, I mean, of course Google is perfect. I ask it to make something about a topic and it'll tell me, it'll run me through a process to create the content. For example, I want to make a video about the best way to build a SaaS as a non-technical person.

9:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I want it to know what my opinions are on that whole topic. And if it doesn't, I want it to ask me, okay, what do you think about this? What about this? What about this? To build a knowledge base around this whole topic so that it can understand how I would write this. Because a lot of content is so opinion-based. Building fact-based content is very easy. You can research things and find facts.

9:59 - Jorge Lewis 
What people are after for content is experienced people that have done it before that can use their experience to provide advice. And I would say I have some experience that I want to be sharing. Instead of just kind of regurgitating everything like, oh, you should raise funding and then you should do this. Like kind of the very basic things. I don't want it to be that. I don't want this project to be a regurgitation of a Google search. I don't want it to kind of search Google and then print whatever it finds.

10:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

10:38 - Biwas bhandari 
I can keep going, but there's, um, But that can be done in normal AI chatbots like chatGPT. You can just ask, okay, I want to do this and it will reply instantly. So what's the selling point of this product?

11:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Um, it's like, it's like, why would I come to these, uh, the content app instead of going to chatGPT?

11:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so this, this right.

11:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I want this project to write your content, not chat, UBT's content or not the internet's content. I want it to be based off of the, the, the user. So the project's going to need to know a lot about the user, whether it can ask questions or it can take some input, wink, wink transcript. Yeah.

11:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I have a lot of ideas and like features, ways we can do this, but I think the vision aspect of this is supposed to be very high level. So I think hopefully I've done an okay job at keeping it high level. Let's go into our corners and rights.

11:57 - Biwas bhandari 
So the vision?

11:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the vision.

11:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

12:10 - Biwas bhandari 
vision PR plus PC don't understand All right, I'm done. I want to understand and create, okay. All right.

13:24 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I'll go ahead and read mine first. A platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the style but also the opinions and experiences, leading to no necessary modifications post-generation.

13:41 - Jorge Lewis 
To understand and create content through a user's perspective and generate content based on his or her vision.

13:49 - Biwas bhandari 
And both of the lines are same. Mine was. After that end, it's the same. I just realized it. Oh yeah.

14:03 - Jorge Lewis 
User's perspective and vision.

14:07 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

14:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So this part we've got aligned. We want it to be based on the user's perspective and vision.

14:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

14:17 - Jorge Lewis 
And I phrase that as style, opinions, and experiences.

14:29 - Biwas bhandari 
So let's say instead of, uh, instead of, uh, instead of no necessary modifications, I think some, we need to modify it to some content.

14:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But at the end, the vision of this is that I can just ask it to make something regarding a topic and it can go ahead and make something.

14:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh.

14:52 - Jorge Lewis 
or even not even I don't want to like the vision isn't I want to ask it to make content about something I wanted to just make content like on like as if it were me like completely autonomous okay yeah so maybe I can I can so a platform that writes content so we're leaving out to the part where Because the vision shouldn't be the implementation of, oh, I ask it for content and then it makes content. It's just, this is what it, I want it to write content and then we can figure out the rest.

15:27 - Biwas bhandari 
It's like instead of hiring a content writer, you come to our platform and tell us about your perspective and what content you want to make.

15:38 - Jorge Lewis 
And that's the hard part, getting your, the user's perspective to this chatbot, like very well, like done.

15:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

15:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

15:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Wait, there's also, so a platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the styles style, but also the opinions and experiences leading to Okay. How do you think that is that good? Or what do you think?

16:18 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, it's good. No. But we need to be able to tell it to modify it later. For example, like we if we if you are a content, if you are a content writer, you will say, Okay, I don't like this part, please modify it or something.

16:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So the end goal is I can just, it just posts content, it writes and posts content for me, I guess, is the end goal, the vision. So a platform that writes or...

16:52 - Jorge Lewis 
That I'm going to say creates content and creates what can mean what writes publish and all of the above. The creates.

17:03 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Does it align with the mission in the mission? We says make content creation and ideas and fast. Oh yeah. There's creation to creation.

17:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So creation, I guess, is both writing the content.

17:21 - Jorge Lewis 
and everything between publishing it. And we're using the word content here, but we know that since we've kind of already briefed ourselves on what this is, at first it'll start with just text content since it's easiest. And that's where we get into it in the roadmap afterwards. So let's just stay on track. So it writes the content as if it were me without necessary modifications, without, okay. And these things will change, by the way, over time, if I'm not mistaken. Like as we go, we can read this every week and say, oh, we've actually changed the mission, I think. Like, I'm just guessing. It usually stays the same, but I think the vision might change here and there. It changes more often, but they both change. So now we get into, let's delete this, this, and then copy this. That's the vision. And here's the mission.

18:17 - Jorge Lewis 
So the product vision board is, okay. So what is, so this is, we can both just fill in at the same time. This is kind of like a group task where we can just each take a part.

18:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

18:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me check. So what is, okay, so let's just vision. What is your purpose in creating the product?

18:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

18:47 - Biwas bhandari 
Targeted group, it's...

19:01 - Biwas bhandari 
Can I fill all the tabs? The targeted groups and all that?

19:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

19:07 - Biwas bhandari 
Can I fill the other empty tabs?

19:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. At the end we can just refute to make sure we're all aligned.

19:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

19:15 - Biwas bhandari 
Targeted groups.

19:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Now what problem does the paradox solve?

20:49 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, are content writers expensive to hire or something?

20:56 - Biwas bhandari 
Depends.

21:00 - Biwas bhandari 
It depends, I think.

21:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Well, they're more expensive than this, so.

21:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh, yeah.

21:13 - Biwas bhandari 
I think that will go into the business school or something like that.

21:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Not so much.

21:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Content creation is time consuming.

21:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Hey, darling.

22:07 - Biwas bhandari 
What?

22:17 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

22:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. I think this is it. Do you need to go to business schools?

22:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yeah, once I, for the target group, one idea I have is that since, so in general with SAS and I hope whoever's watching this doesn't get bored by this, but, um, SAS there's two aspects of, of SAS. That's really hard making it and making a good product and then selling it. Selling it requires distribution, which is probably the hardest part, getting it to people that need it. For us, our means of distribution for this would be Okay, so the reason why we're advantaged at making a good product on that side is because this is going to serve me. I know I'm the customer of this, so I'll understand my own problems. And then to distribute it, I'll be able to use my network of people that are also, like one example is I could use my network for people that are also trying to start content writing for whatever they're doing. Because I know quite a lot of people instead of people, a lot of entrepreneurs and business owners that are getting into content writing, but they're struggling with kind of doing it and their own business. But because everyone right now understands the value of content writing and how important it is to build the brand and all that.

23:45 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

23:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, and then, yeah, for this also to help the selling part is since I understand the problems, I can present this better to potential users since I, I can use my own pains.

23:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

24:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe, I think I can rephrase it to business or entrepreneurs, I think, because that's the term they use on all their social media and stuff. So entrepreneurs trying to, or that do content creation.

24:26 - Jorge Lewis 
They either do it or they're trying to, no, because if they, One thing to think about is if we, well, I was going to write entrepreneurs that are trying to get into content creation, but that's not really a market because those people that have it, that are trying to get into it, I don't think they're going to understand the value this brings. Like, I don't know if that's, maybe, maybe I'm wrong, but I think starting with people that are already making content and saying, Hey, we can save you this many hours is a much better sell than, Hey, we could save you this many hours instead of we will save you if you buy this.

25:01 - Biwas bhandari 
Yes, someone who is getting into the content creation will come back later after he knows that, oh, it's so much of hassle to brainstorm about it.

25:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, and then, okay, who are the target customers and users? Business owners with no prior knowledge in content creation, but wants to write content for his or her business. That's interesting, yeah?

25:25 - Biwas bhandari 
So, yeah.

25:27 - Jorge Lewis 
That's very interesting because... There's so many people that this could target. It's a matter of picking. The reason I'm picking entrepreneurs is because it's my network. But my network also includes my dad. And he has a lot of friends that are also running a business.

25:47 - Jorge Lewis 
They could have a lot of improvements if they start content creation. If we're targeting businesses that don't do content creation already, we have two jobs. We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?

26:10 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just come to our platform to create content maybe.

26:23 - Jorge Lewis 
That's how we would sell them on it.

26:28 - Jorge Lewis 
For example, if I sold this software to me, I'm already making videos and I'm already doing it. If you tell me, hey, you probably spend 30 hours a week writing content, why not just have conversations with your friends? And use that to create content, save 30 hours and just have normal conversations instead. And I'll be like, damn, that's actually, yeah, okay. Instead, if I sell it to Jonas, where Jonas wants to start a content creation, wants to start writing content, for him, when I come to him, I'm saying, hey, when you start your business, You can, um, or you should start your content creation now because it's so important. I had to convince him of that. Why do I have to convince, why should I convince him when I'm already doing it? Like, I don't want to convince him to start and also buy this instead. I could just, they can already start by themselves and just buy it. So I would, I think I would be a better target customer than Jonas because I've already started. Yeah.

27:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

27:29 - Jorge Lewis 
But later, like this, this has a lot of potential to target like business owners as well. Like we could have a whole sales process of also including that aspect of convincing them to start content creation saying, Hey, content creation has never been easier with this. You should start content creation with our software. That could be a later, that could be our offer later, but right now I think it's better. Make your content creation easier with this.

27:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Yeah.

27:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Okay, so we're the target customers and users. I'm going to just keep that as one question.

28:11 - Jorge Lewis 
This thing is going to change so much that it's mostly important so that everyone's always aligned through conversation, I think, rather than having it on paper.

28:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Businesses use business plans. We, specifically at Startino, use a lean business plan.

28:30 - Jorge Lewis 
The problem, what you're supposed to do is not use that as a, like that's not supposed to point you to success. That's supposed to point you to the next chapter. The next chapter is determined by whenever things change, like all the time they'll change. You have to update your business plan accordingly or your business model. Um, Because in the same way with this, it has to be updated constantly. But it's just a hassle. I haven't gone into that Google document and updated our business model. But we understand, Jonas and I, the same vision, because we always talk about it. So I think that's more important than actually a document that says it.

29:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Having it on a document is very important when you're trying to share it with other people, though.

29:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's also useful for distilling whatever information you have into very concise forms.

29:46 - Jorge Lewis 
What benefit does it provide? What benefit does this product provide? Bro, it's the same... Bro, it's... I'm not gonna... The problem is this. Of course, it's solving the problem. What do you mean... I don't know. Yeah, I'm just lazy. It's only me and you making this and at some point, this is all gonna change, so... How is the product going to benefit the company? What are the business goals? Okay.

30:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Business goal is make money, bro. Quote my Brazilian friends. I think the first goal is to, the business goal is to allow me, allow Jorge to produce content.

30:37 - Biwas bhandari 
It will be launched as a SaaS and also it will help you yourself write content and all that.

30:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So first it needs to allow me to write content. Like, cause if I can't use this, why would I, I can't sell it, you know? So that's the goal, the first goal. Um, and at some point it's going to be launched as a SaaS.

31:00 - Jorge Lewis 
as a market leader in content, AI content creation software industry.

31:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So, we need some, I'd like some fixed, some smart goals. So, something measurable.

31:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So, to allow Jorge to produce content, You know what's interesting? It's, I don't think it's so weird because my problem with me is not that it's, so the problem is that I'm not writing content because I'm procrastinating. It's not that it's taking me too long. It's that I'm procrastinating it.

31:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So. Maybe this should be making it enjoyable enough or making it frictionless to a point where it's easy enough for me to make content. I don't know. Do you get where I'm going? Because I don't write the Startino content right now. And this won't be making it This won't be making that faster because how do you make something faster that you don't do? So I think this is going instead of what this, what benefit does this provide is it. Convinces me to write content that content is that writing the content is worth it because the effort to make it as less.

32:35 - Biwas bhandari 
So, yeah, I think instead of saying make, uh, to help content creation easier and faster should be content creation, uh, enjoyable, maybe.

32:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Content creation what?

32:49 - Biwas bhandari 
Enjoyable, more enjoyable.

32:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that can be the angle because, okay, this is a perfect example. Right now, the call you and I are in, I can upload this transcript to this software and I can say, make a post about the vision and mission statement. And highlight the key points that we mentioned in this. And you can highlight things like, oh, not spending too much time on specific things or whatever. And that'll make content writing more enjoyable for me because I can, instead of writing content, do things like this, where it's just I'm having a conversation with you and it's more enjoyable. So maybe the goal could be to make it more enjoyable, maybe. I don't know.

33:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Because I've tried I tried writing blocks one two times in the blog post and medium I think I've written one two and I've slipped it but if if that would be more enjoyable like playing games and all that but

33:59 - Jorge Lewis 
That will be what if effective maybe yeah, yeah Yeah, that's interesting maybe Yeah, because like, imagine this, imagine instead of writing a script, what you do to make the content is you have a conversation about whatever that topic is with the friend. You tell the friend, Hey, can we have a conversation? I want to record it. I'm going to use it to make a script later. How does that sound? And they're like, cool.

34:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Why not?

34:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

34:39 - Jorge Lewis 
It's interesting. So, um, in, in, um, Give me one second, I'm gonna find a...

34:51 - Jorge Lewis 
A message I sent. Here. Wait.

34:57 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I don't know where... Actually, it's probably on the Obsidian. Let me find it.

35:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Don't worry, I didn't hear anything.

35:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I found it.

35:52 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I'm just going to post it as a note here. So, I think a great method to give these videos both as high quality and validated as possible is to have a recording group session.

36:13 - Jorge Lewis 
The recording should include face cams and screen cams. We'll pretend it's both a live podcast and research session. Merging the two into one in order to save time. The first half can be more of research than discussion, and the second half we can discuss about putting things on paper. So the goal of that is at the end, this makes the production of work, of creating the script, gathering footage, and researching, validating opinions, a lot more fun, and more importantly, faster. We take the recordings of the participants and use it to structure and create the actual video. Probably won't use any of the footage in the final video, but we definitely could. So, this text, by the way, was in my plan for how to do the Startino videos. When I first conceived of, okay, we should probably be doing content. So, I think we're coming back to full circle where this is a big point where it should be fun.

37:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And I think that's the issue because content writing is boring.

37:10 - Biwas bhandari 
Like I don't want to write like it's even, even if you know, yeah, it's important for me to write content.

37:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And also, yeah, it's so, okay. So maybe we can read. If we look at the mission again.

37:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:38 - Jorge Lewis 
So the problem isn't actually that it takes too much time. I think it's that it's not enjoyable enough.

37:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:49 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a little bit of both because I wonder if I would eventually, if I would, okay, an okay example is, okay, no, no, no. So what I've been with Jonas, whenever we, We have amazing conversations. Earlier we were just discussing about SvelteKit and when we should be using form actions versus API routes and et cetera. It was a good technical conversation. If we could just take that conversation and convert it into some form of content, whether it's a snippet of that video and we can publish that or it writes a script for us or a post, anything like that would be great. So, maybe the mission isn't that it takes too much time to write content. I think it's... Can you see where I'm going with this? It's more of trying to use what I already have, which is conversations with my team, which is conversations I already have.

39:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Trying to summarize it and write a blog or content, something like that.

39:15 - Jorge Lewis 
But what's the problem then? The problem is there's no way to repurpose our conversations, I guess. I don't know.

39:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So you see, this is where these workshops are very helpful because you, you're really trying to understand what you're trying to do here.

39:31 - Biwas bhandari 
I think it's not the, uh, what's the problem, but what we are trying to improve maybe because right now we are having a good conversation and that's good. But, uh, what, you know, what, what could make it more effective is if you just summarize it and make a blog post so everybody can read and all that. Maybe so.

39:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so the problem is that when people have conversations, that knowledge and that there's value in that conversation that gets lost as soon as that, that only gets shared to those two people after that conversation finishes. But instead we want to extract as much value as possible by recording it and then converting it into something, into content. Whether you publish it to the public or just your team.

40:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So the problem is that we don't extract enough values from conversations.

40:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But when I'm thinking, it doesn't sound very like, okay, the mission, instead of saying the problem, the mission is to make my conversations more valuable by being able to write content from them.

40:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That's the mission because that's pretty realistic. The only other time is that it's like maybe sometimes it's not my conversations, it's maybe a voice message I recorded on myself. Like I'm on a walk and I just want to discuss the topic and convert it into content afterwards.

41:39 - Biwas bhandari 
So, I think that one is different than what we were talking before.

41:57 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, just before we were talking about that, okay, I want to write a content, but I need to instead of spending my time on company, I'm spending time on brainstorming the brainstorming for the content. It takes too long time for that. And so in order to make it easier, I just need a tool that will help me. I'm thinking of making content on SAS, for example. And based on that, our product will generate a content or something like that, maybe.

42:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I can see. Yeah.

42:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I want to take you through a story of how I can imagine using this. So I have, I've recorded about a hundred read AI meetings between my team and clients and other people I've met within my network. So what I can imagine myself doing is uploading those transcripts or videos or whatever format to this software. And then I say, Hey, Can you write, can you help me write something about SAS on, on how to build a SAS as a non-technical founder. It'll go through all those, try to pull as much as it can from it.

43:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh yeah. So instead of pulling it from the internet and creating separate content, it will take all the transcripts you provided. And based on that, it will create a whole new content. Yeah.

43:34 - Jorge Lewis 
But there's also another aspect of this project of this, of what I want is like, I want, um, okay, okay, I'm getting, so, okay, okay, let me, I'm gonna go on top of the mission, the blue card, so, why is that so small? So, writing, or, having conversations is more fun than writing.

44:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Dumb? Yeah.

44:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Using other's posts as inspiration is easier than thinking from scratch.

44:42 - Jorge Lewis 
using voice using unstructured voice notes is more fun to make than writing scripts I'm gonna say more enjoyable but then also um Using all my previous conversations and data is more efficient to produce new content than restate what I've already discussed.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So I've got these two sides of every point. So that first one is more efficient. This one's more enjoyable. This one's ease is easier. And this last one is more enjoyable.

45:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So those are kind of the use cases I can imagine. This top one is the most business oriented where, or is the most indirect. I'm not thinking about making content when I have conversations. It's just, I'm already having conversations. Let's reuse that into, so extracting more value from conversations. That are already being done so this one's extracting more value from the conversations that are already being done make using unstructured voice notes is more enjoyable this one so what do you mean by unstructured voice notes so for example like What I want to do is open my phone and start a voice note and say, hey, I'm just going to ramble on about my opinions, my experience relating to SaaS and something. So for example, the three biggest mistakes I've seen in my past is that you non-technical founders will have a big vision, but then not be able to isolate one feature. Another one might be they're not niched enough. Etc. And I just rent on for a bit without having to worry about the structure of it being very organized.

47:28 - Biwas bhandari 
I can see this second point is more, I mean, like a practical, for example, in the midnight, I will be having so much ideas in my mind that I can just babble about it on the voice.

47:43 - Jorge Lewis 
It's easier to extract. To put down on paper ideas and thoughts.

47:53 - Jorge Lewis 
So this, so in the end, all of these are going to be content.

48:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So at the end, when you, your notes and ideas are, I mean, they're very nice to have, of course, but the end goal in this case is for content. So like, and then using others posts as inspiration is, What is that doing? That's kind of...

48:24 - Biwas bhandari 
I think we don't need that thought point. Using all those posts as interest. Um, no, no, no.

48:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I actually like about this one, so I think it was in, it was in the other. Oh, what did I click?

48:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it was in the other fake jam. If you check out my screen share on the Google meet or if you just, um, So okay, other contents in the same niche. So what I mean by this is, if we were to take a look at an example of an implementation, I thought of, so I have a, you know, Tinder.

49:05 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

49:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I want.

49:10 - Jorge Lewis 
What I want to be able to do is it gives me content that from the internet and it says, Hey, it gives me the content and I can say, I like this. I don't like this. Or to give it to give more context, I can say, I agree with this part, but I don't agree with this part. So it's still me. I'm adding my opinion to it, but it's giving, it's giving me a foundation, something to go off of Like I can just build on top of that because if I agree with it, then there's no reason to create it from scratch. And I feel like if you do this a thousand times, that's one way you can capture your opinion on things in a very efficient manner.

49:51 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I got that.

49:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe...

50:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So using others' posts is...

50:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I just described is not, is, is a great way to is, I guess it's easier than thinking from scratch or yeah. Cause content itself is, is so it should be unique to you, but if people share opinions, it's not like we're copying someone's post. It's like, all we're doing is going to copy two sentences from his whole post and copy another two sentences from another post. Not because we're just trying to copy it, but because we actually agree with it.

50:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

50:39 - Jorge Lewis 
It's like, um, it's like we're using GitHub code. You might reuse someone's little micro, like someone's project. That's a tiny part of your whole content because you like it and you think it's a good, a good package or something. You could have made your own unique one, but why not? Why just use that one?

51:01 - Biwas bhandari 
For example, if I'm making content on programming, I can see others first, take inspiration, and based on that, I can write my own.

51:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And the important part is that you're actually not being a, you're not, what's the word when you're...

51:28 - Jorge Lewis 
There's a word for being too agreeable and programmers are often...

51:38 - Biwas bhandari 
I can't find it.

51:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So oftentimes when, for example, the primogen, you know the primogen?

51:49 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

51:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So he says a lot of things on his stuff, on his podcast. He reviews a lot of articles, by the way, which is like, if I watch that article, if I was a content writer, I could write a new article watching that for the Prime Agent, for example. So maybe this app, what it does is it facilitates, it records your screen And those reviews of articles and you just review it like that. Maybe that's how it gathers. I don't know. Or we can do the Tinder style where you're like, uh, yes, which part, uh, this part, I don't know.

52:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Or we can just paste the link of the article and say, okay, this is the article and here are my opinions and you can send it via voice input.

52:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like there's a lot of UXs, user experience ways to do this that would make it more accessible. But the main idea is to use that as a foundation to create or to articulate your own opinions. To give you like a... It's easier to say what I believe when someone says their opinion on it. Like you can say you believe in... Are you... Okay, that was a bad example.

53:12 - Jorge Lewis 
If I hear you say that using types is better than not using types, it's a lot easier to respond to that than just thinking, okay, what's an idea? Oh, types. Yeah. Right. I think we got the point. So using other people's posts is easier to gather our own opinion.

53:40 - Jorge Lewis 
And then what else? Having conversations are more enjoyable. I will have more conversations.

54:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Writing content, i.e.

54:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Having a conversation is more fun, so I will write more content.

54:24 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Anyways, there's not much, um, there's no format to this. Like all of these are pretty random, like what's on the left and right side, but I think it's more important to just kind of get those thoughts on paper first. And then we can use that to write something more well formatted afterwards. Okay. This misalignment is bothering me. Why is that?

54:46 - Jorge Lewis 
There we go.

54:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, cool.

54:51 - Jorge Lewis 
And then, this Google Meet was supposed to be just a vision and workshop mission. A vision and mission workshop, but we ended up just going through a rabbit hole of what this project actually is. Which is the entire point of this workshop, so I guess it illustrates that. Maybe Jonas is free now at this point. Okay, so using all that.

55:18 - Biwas bhandari 
So what's the mission now?

55:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, what is the new mission?

55:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's take some time and go and go iterate. So let's, I'm going to go into my own corner and just think about it for a second and write it down.

55:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Hmm.

56:33 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I got something out, I think. I'll be in the restroom real quick.

57:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Oops.

57:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

58:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you finished your thing?

58:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I finished mine.

59:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Changing your thoughts, conversations into experiences, into content by extracting relevant into them.

59:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah.

59:41 - Biwas bhandari 
But if we look at mine, the target audience will not only be content creators and entrepreneurs, but everybody, because everybody had thoughts and experiences which they want to share to others.

1:00:12 - Biwas bhandari 
It is the friction involved in content creation by making it more human.

1:00:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Mine one is more misaligned with the original.

1:00:40 - Jorge Lewis 
It's more what? More misaligned with the from the original mission so make content creation out of ideation faster and require less mental effort technically what we've described does that that's the But I think we can narrow it down more precisely into what we're doing. All of these above that we list is experiences. I think we can group them into just the term experiences.

1:01:30 - Jorge Lewis 
To allow experiences to be used for content writing.

1:01:38 - Jorge Lewis 
To allow experiences to be used for content writing.

1:01:46 - Jorge Lewis 
To create content. Allow previous experiences to be used. So our mission is to allow previous experiences to be used to create content.

1:02:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So we went from making the content creation easier to enjoyable and it's Allowing previous experiences to be used to make content is making it faster and require less mental effort. It's like, I don't know, it's the same. I think we can just keep these both. We'll have all of this here. We don't have to come to a conclusion right now. I think we're pretty aligned on kind of the direction, but the line that we go in, it can be defined later, maybe with Jonas' help.

1:03:05 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Content can be made not only through previous experiences to only maybe we can create content about anything, not only previous experiences.

1:03:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like also like if we use, Hmm, I think, I think the mission, I think this mission makes sense, but I think what we change is the vision. Maybe.

1:03:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:03:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's, um, Let me see. This is accurate. This is what the platform should be doing. It should create content if it were me. Not only the style, this is the vision, the means, how we get there. These are what I want to do to get there. I want to use conversations. I want to use my unstructured voice notes. I want to use other people's posts as inspirations. I want to use my, yeah.

1:04:02 - Biwas bhandari 
But initially we can, uh, make the app that can just, uh, create a content based on your, um, the one that was initially, uh, what do you call it? Proposed or something like that.

1:04:22 - Biwas bhandari 
So you want to write a content, but you are just, uh, and you have the idea too, but you are just not able to start writing it in a copy and all that. So for that, uh, our AI chat bot can help you. Uh, visualize, uh, not visualize. How do you call it? Give a certain context or ideas or just write the content.

1:04:54 - Jorge Lewis 
I think so for me, at least I don't think the ideas are too hard right now. Ideas become hard or no, no, no. In every, so in every day, every day I have a lot of conversations and I'm quite sure that I don't need to create new ideas to write about. I can use those conversations to make ideas. Like I say, Hey, are there any types of like, are there any cool posts I can make from today's news?

1:05:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:05:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. That can be great.

1:05:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So that instead of when you're writing a voice memo, instead of thinking, oh, this is going to be making a video. You're just talking like in general, like you can go from talking about the problems SAS founders make to, um, to ugly code. And then you can go to architectural problems. And in the end, it won't matter because all you're going to do is insert this into, um, the AI chatbot and he'll use it when relevant. So like, um, so. Yeah, okay, cool. We can touch on this. Hopefully Jonas can watch all this and see us going in circles and maybe help us figure out where we want to go. Because usually how this works is there's one facilitator, the project owner, and then the stakeholders, so like, and the developers, I guess. So it'd be helpful if, because I'm also, I'm facilitating, developing, and the owner. So I don't know if that's helpful or not. I don't think that's helpful.

1:06:30 - Jorge Lewis 
And Jonas has watched quite a lot of, he's educated quite a lot on this. I've just done this workshop once with Jonas and here I am trying to do one. All right. Well, I guess let's just leave it at there. We can go into the road. I don't know. Let's go into the roadmap maybe.

1:07:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me, uh oh. Are we in the wrong file again?

1:07:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Not the right one. Let me rename it. I think I'm just gonna copy all of this and paste it into the other file and just use a different page because going through, going between different files is really inefficient.

1:07:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. All right.

1:07:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So I pasted it there.

1:07:41 - Biwas bhandari 
Word bet.

1:08:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have the conception, and then the vision and mission, and then the planning.

1:08:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So the planning will define the backlog pretty much, the features we're going to build.

1:08:31 - Jorge Lewis 
And which features we want to build first, and when, and all that. So, very tiring, huh?

1:08:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So, let's see. Also, wait.

1:08:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Will requested access to something.

1:09:28 - Jorge Lewis 
So we want to get into the roadmap and kind of the features. So I'm going to borrow this from here. And if you go to the planning page, are you following along, by the way?

1:09:37 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm just watching it in this screen.

1:09:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I think the only feature we're building is the chatbot.

1:10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
On the front end, we just need a chatbot. And that chatbot's going to need to have all the capabilities.

1:10:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just kind of going off of nothing here. So we have the chatbot.

1:10:27 - Jorge Lewis 
And this guy needs...

1:10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's start with just trick like or actually just two And then Needs a good strategy to write good content So the strategy to write good content is gonna be the hardest part because hmm And it's going to require a lot of figuring out the best way to make.

1:11:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I think the hard part about this. Yeah. I mean, the only the the unique value proposition of this is that we can convert anything into content.

1:11:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Like any text in any conversation or transcript or meeting, anything like that, we can convert into content.

1:11:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Mm hmm.

1:11:35 - Jorge Lewis 
And to do that, we need a system that's really good at that. And how can we tell this bot to make good content if we don't know how to make good content ourselves? So we have a lot of homework to do, and we have to figure out how to make good content.

1:11:53 - Jorge Lewis 
There's actually one guy I know. Oh, this is pretty funny. What's his name?

1:12:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, luckily me. This guy.

1:12:05 - Biwas bhandari 
No.

1:12:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I think he does, um, like he teaches people how to do content creation. Okay.

1:12:15 - Jorge Lewis 
It doesn't seem like it.

1:12:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, but what we have to do is a lot of research and figuring out how to make, we need to figure out the graph we want to use, the structure, the cognitive architecture we want to use, and then That's one thing that's for the technical implementation and then also how to make good content. So how can we teach this chatbot to make good content?

1:12:52 - Biwas bhandari 
So one part is we need to, okay, we ourselves need to know how to make a good content at first, or we need to just research a bit on that. And for the technical part of the chatbot.

1:13:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So the chatbot has access to the files, but it's not using the files. It's using a knowledge, like I think the knowledge graph is the way to go for this.

1:13:31 - Jorge Lewis 
You know knowledge graphs, right?

1:13:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

1:13:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:13:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So just figuring out how do we make this chatbot do this well. And we can plan this all we want. The best way to go about it is probably to make an MVP in like three hours and see how how like a just normal chatbot tries to make content from a transcript. So I think the first step, like for me, my intuition just tells me, okay, let's create a knowledge graph from a bunch of transcripts. So I'm going to take all my, and I want to use existing data so that it just saves time. So I'm going to take all these reports, print out the transcripts, upload it to Superbit, or no, that's already over-complicating it. Just use those text files locally. Yeah.

1:14:27 - Biwas bhandari 
And then we can just pass it. These are the con. Yeah. Pass it as a input instead of saving it in.

1:14:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Take out, um, check out graph reg. This start the, this is what we'll be using to, to make this happen. At first it uses, um, it uses an LLM to make a graph, a graph like this. Then these are the steps of indexing it. And then at the end, it queries it using an LLM as well. So for vector databases, we have a model that creates the vector database. It decides, it knows what words are to place where in the vector space. For this one, it knows where to place things relative to other things. That's all these steps. So what we can do is play around and this is why I'm doing it in Python for one one reason is because Everything is in Python like this is in Python. So, okay One warning one warning for you specifically. Yeah is Warning graph reg indexing can be expensive. I looking into this and implementing it. So my intuition is just telling me, okay, I'm gonna start, I'm gonna make a knowledge graph from all the transcripts I have, and then I'm going to just try from there to just out of the box, see if the knowledge graph can make some content, like anything. If it does an okay job of that, I'll be like, okay, this is easier than I thought. If it doesn't, that's what I'm expecting, then I'll have to look at things like, a flow of, okay, first we're going to gather all the topics in the idea of this, all the pieces of content, or we'll create a topic and then sub topics and then everything like that. And then we gather content from there. So like, just figure out the flow.

1:16:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. For me personally, I don't know what values to content provide. So I need to look on that too.

1:16:35 - Jorge Lewis 
What values?

1:16:36 - Biwas bhandari 
What are the benefits of content writing?

1:16:40 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you mean benefits?

1:16:42 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, uh, what good kind of content, um, I mean, I don't know. Okay. I mean, I don't know what good values to content writing provides personally.

1:16:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you mean like you don't know what good content is, you mean, or no, no, no.

1:17:01 - Biwas bhandari 
What, what is the benefit of writing content?

1:17:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I mean the benefit. How is that important?

1:17:14 - Biwas bhandari 
I personally need to know, I think maybe in order to create this app, I need to do some research on content writing and all that, since I personally have no knowledge on all these things.

1:17:26 - Jorge Lewis 
But you want to write, you write blog articles, right? You like that?

1:17:31 - Biwas bhandari 
No.

1:17:36 - Biwas bhandari 
I've written one too. But I've heard every developer saying every developer should write articles and blogs.

1:17:44 - Jorge Lewis 
But do you enjoy it?

1:17:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

1:17:50 - Biwas bhandari 
I like making videos instead of writing blogs.

1:17:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, that's already the reason, because you enjoy it. For most content, it depends what you're doing it for. For Startino, there's a couple reasons. First one is because it can attract clients. It shows our expertise. It shows we have an online presence and we're real people. Another reason is because I would enjoy I know the team would enjoy making those videos, like a competition of our team making the best chess or something. I would enjoy making that and I know other team members would enjoy it.

1:18:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It also might be a way to recruit talent. The reasons I think are kind of, they depend on you.

1:18:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, why would you write content? I don't know. It really depends on you. For me, for my personal channel, for example, I like doing that because I get to reflect on what I respect, reflect on my life. I've learned, but also because I can help other people that are in similar situations. And also because I know in the longterm, having a personal brand is very powerful.

1:19:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

1:19:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, Quen's asking me to call, but I need to go use the restroom and I gotta go to Jiu-Jitsu.

1:19:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I think we can end this session for today. Yeah, so...

1:19:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you hopping on tonight?

1:19:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I'll hop on.

1:19:34 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, um, I'll I'll try to hop on since I'm excited. I might have the motivation But yeah, I'm excited about this Hopefully, it's not too hard but like for me I'm gonna be really annoyed because it's not gonna be perfect because yeah, he sucks at making content I hate reading chativity content every time I'm on LinkedIn. I read chativity content.

1:19:59 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm just So annoying Yeah, if I go faster than you, I'll do some research on this topic.

1:20:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. If, if you want, you can merge your research with trying to use graph rag.

1:20:16 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

1:20:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, you just, it's the installation is really simple. There's a lot of tutorials online as well that I found quite useful. I haven't used them yet, but they were very simple.

1:20:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

1:20:26 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, bro. Um, yeah, thanks for your time. Thanks for the brainstorming. And, um, I'll maybe see you later tonight, if not tomorrow.

1:20:33 - Biwas bhandari

Wed, May 15, 2024

0:03 - Jorge Lewis 
My eyes are really blue in this lighting.

1:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye bye.

1:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
He's trying to join, I think.

1:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello.

1:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, how are you? I'm good, and you?

2:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, not bad. I'm on a train, so the signal's a bit patchy. Yeah, it's a bit patchy, the signal. No, I wish.

2:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, just beyond it.

2:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm gonna kill my video guys.

2:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no worries. Yeah, I was noticing that... Jonas, does this voice sound okay to you? Yeah, it was a bit buggy. It sounds a bit sped up.

2:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So, if you don't mind, Kieran, just throw in some noise at us.

2:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, let's see.

2:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm struggling to bring it up and to have this phone call at the same time.

2:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So yeah, I can bring it up What All right, I'll open it up on the screen share.

3:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you guys see the screen? Yeah. It's coming in.

3:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Yeah.

4:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, two seconds. You're not showing your screen. You're showing sort of a very trippy version of all of your screens.

5:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see it now?

5:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

5:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, sorry, yeah.

5:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So far, was that good? Was that correct, Stephen? Or, sorry, Cuan?

5:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so let me...

5:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the to-do list is...

5:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
It shouldn't really be a massively new feature, but in terms of people adding in their own... I mean, in essence, a to-do list is the habits that they need to be done. One is that the system generates them, and the other one is that the user generates them. So that's the only variance here, but it's still fundamentally the same capability that you build.

5:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

5:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Jonas, do you want to, or should I explain kind of the thought process?

6:05 - Jorge Lewis 
You can go ahead.

6:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

6:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
the handy crush aspects, that's not, that's a much later phase. This is just a raw capability.

6:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's say somebody has said...

6:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know if you guys can hear me. Let's say somebody says... Their plan is to finish eating by 7 p.m. Every day, and the coach is talking to them, and they keep on breaking that. They might say, actually, I want to change that to 8 p.m. So, in essence, that's the same technology, because you're going in and modifying the attributes of an existing task.

8:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, yeah, let's let's pare that back because This is just one feature set. Let's say we didn't do this.

8:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't understand how you... You pretty much have to be able to do this anyway in the core feature set.

8:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because there's going to be a number of actions that the user has to track around Eat, Mood, Mind, and Sleep. They're the four categories.

8:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so we have to be able to create what those milestones, or not milestones, but what those activities are. And they might be different for every user. So that is the same capability. The gamification aside, what I'm concerned about is that you guys have a different interpretation of the requirements than I do. So what I'd like to try and do is if you can go back to the Merle What I'm going to do is I'm going to talk through the end-to-end user experience as an example. Can you guys still hear me okay? I just want to make sure because I don't know if you're okay. So the user will hear about the service. They will then register on the website, which is separate from registering for a program. So registration on the website would just be username, password, very basic. We'd then ideally let the boss take over and say, hey, welcome to the thing. The next program starts the next number of weeks. Let's fill in your profile. And it would do some very basic profile filling in, like their weight, their height. We would then work out what their BMR is and their RMR and that sort of stuff. And the program starts. So underlying the program, there is a period of time. It could be an eight-week program. It could be a 12-week program. It could be a month of master class. It could just be that there's a program that is a variable of length, and it has a number of weeks, and it has content associated with it. That's just the whole elements. So at the end of every week is a theme or an objective. It could be mindset. It could be diet. It could be sugar. It could be movement. It could be zone 2 training, zone 5 training. The importance of exercise, what happens So on a daily basis, there is, you know, certainly let's say in the first eight-week program, and what I'm trying to get away from is an explicit feature set as opposed to building a capability. So capability gives us flexibility rather than it does this one thing. So what's important is that a person as part of the eight-week program will be given an activity, for example, you need to walk for an hour a day.

10:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
And you need to not eat more than a number of calories, like 1,800 calories. So there's just two simple activities that everybody will get on the program. The mindset one will be listening to all of our content as a simple action. And then the sleep will be tracking certain metrics around your sleep. That's just the basic level of tracking. Does that make sense so far?

11:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Which data are you talking about? Like, for example, the calories.

11:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so they can either, there's two ways the user enters data. One is proactively and one is reactively. So proactively, they would go to the app and they would just go, you know, they could either go to the bar and say, hey, I'm just eating 500 calories. The bot would then record that against their profile for the day. They can go into the track section inside the site and put it in the meal and put in the more calories that way, or they don't put anything in. At the end of the day check-in, the bot can go to their profile and see what has not been done that they should have done that day and then say, What did you eat today? How many calories did you eat? What meals did you have? And it would ask them a number of questions around that in order to capture that data. So that's the sort of data capture aspect that's relatively dynamic because if we all got ten actions and I filled in nine of them, it would ask me about one. If you hadn't filled in any, it would ask you about all ten. Yeah. Then there is, there is this sense, and this is one is the coaching aspect, which I think is, I want to make sure we've talked about this with the conversational piece and the memory piece, but there's also attributes of being a coach where you're trying to encourage people, motivate people and drive them forward. So for example, if we knew that it was somebody's birthday next week, we'd be like, Hey, you know, you've got your birthday next week. You might want to.

13:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
this in order to earn the right to go dirty on your birthday, as an example. Or it might say, hey, you've just done fantastic. You've started. You've done your one hour walk for five days in a row. You're two days away from a full week streak. That's awesome. So that level of achievement, achievement badges, milestones, is something that is absolutely critical to phase one. I'm not talking about the gamification of Candy Crush in terms of the to-do list and all that.

13:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is very basic milestones, like, wow, you nearly finished the program and you've hit 50 miles. Wow, that's awesome. Well done you. You've done seven days in a row.

14:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
And don't let your tracking slip. It's that sort of level of stuff. So like every morning, I've tracked my HRV. And I guess the first thing after I fill it in, I get a, well done you, you've just done 35 days in a row. Amazing. It stops there. I mean, there's the whole, there's a more advanced area that we want to get into.

14:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
My sense would be, I would prefer it not to be sort of a hard coding value, but something that we could give some guides to say, look out for these types of things and so the code can pick it up.

15:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Okay, so it's kind of in the middle, okay.

15:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I suppose this is the question I have. I mean, this is in the mural. I think it's pretty well documented that we need to do this. It's on the bot section, and it's on the membership site section. This is the end of day check-in coaching.

16:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's the end of day coaching check-in. It's on the neural process now. And it's a little bit concerning that this is missed in your scope workout.

16:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's our mistake.

16:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I need to get from you guys is a more explicit list of the features that we are going to get, rather than just the high level that was in the initial proposal. Because I think what this has demonstrated is that there is a gap. So before I can sign off any money, I need to have a very clear idea, because for me, it was in the the Yeah, I mean, basically it's your high level backlog.

17:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So with that in mind, we can probably complete that today and send it to you later today. How does that sound?

17:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

17:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
And again, if you need to jump on it, I'll be off this train in an hour, so if you Let me just give a high-level run-through of everything in my head and see if anything else dings for you. That you may have missed. So yeah, we would want the bot to be aware of context. So for example, oh, the weather's going to be bad, where the user is. So it might say, hey, wrap up warm today or be wet on your walk.

19:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
being used to be aware of angel milestones coming up to celebrate people. It will try to protect any sort of streaks of recording activity. And it can be proactive or reactive on tracking data, and it will coach them, and coaching is a very variable thing, but this is something that we would want to be able to train the bot to do. It's a raw capability that we would need to train and educate over time in terms of what we mean by coaching. It's a very difficult term to define, or it would just be, you know, capabilities of training. There's end of day, there's milestones, we want them to be aware of the context of the course, so they can answer questions about, what do you mean by this? Help me understand that a bit more.

20:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, registration profile filling in.

20:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, LMS contact, I've been able to manage content that is available on a drip bed basis on different days. Content being video, text, links, video, audio, imagery, PDFs. Yeah. So, okay, so.

20:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Audio is really poor.

20:54 - Jorge Lewis 
the past probably 10 seconds was inaudible.

20:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Last thing that you talked about was the LMS that we could hear.

21:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So I'm sorry. I don't know what you can hear me now.

21:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we can hear you.

21:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

21:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
So yeah, the LMS, I think, is just straightforward, where we can add up content, which is videos, docs, links, images, whatever, usual content, allocated to days. It has a shelf life that might disappear after a number of days when we say persistent. So it's standard sort of drip-fed stuff. There's nothing in a bit of there. You just need a simple interface to manage content in the background.

22:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
right?

22:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So the drip feed, make sure the user has the correct access they should have, yeah, giving you access to upload content, all that.

22:34 - Jorge Lewis 
their sleep and then track that on a daily basis, right?

22:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, that's absolutely a good question.

23:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
And

24:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the mems will take most time. We'll have to create a page for tracking calories, page for tracking movement. The tracking mind is easy because it's just LMS. And then page for tracking sleep. So just all of those.

24:53 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you mean page?

24:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you open your phone and go on a website. That's a page. In that page, you can track sleep. Then you can go to another page where you can track like food, you're eating calories, go to another page, you can track how much you've moved.

25:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Wouldn't it make sense if it's all just in one day, like a daily form?

25:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sure, yeah. He seemed like he wanted pages.

25:45 - Jorge Lewis 
These are not how many calories they're eating a day.

26:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
So now, like, in the initial scope, just a number they enter. The rest, it's time to see things on top.

26:32 - Jorge Lewis 
But I don't think that the user knows a number.

26:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, like, for the MVP, they don't. It's not real users, it's just testing if it's possible, and if they don't know the number, there's probably some other solution. It's not necessary to prove the concept.

26:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Ok, I'll have to ask him on that, because it seems like he wants that to be just a normal thing.

27:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, of course, but how we make it more easy to track calories is later.

27:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
But I mean, there's... Just numbers, I think. Just enter a number, that'll save us a lot of time.

27:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but I mean, that number won't be useful at all. The user will have no clue.

27:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
like creating, using a database of food items and their calorie levels and then having that on the website will take at least like a couple days.

27:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

28:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Gathering results from that because I just don't think the there's any viability of the user inputting calories unless Yeah, like Microsoft Teams, I think is just the best one. Yeah, I think they're the best for bad Wi-Fi.

29:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Have you accepted them or is he like stuck on your please accept?

30:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, he's just not here yet.

30:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll create a new link. You need to close your toilet door.

30:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, you said the scope probably wouldn't change at all, that it would be identical. That was an eek for me.

30:44 - Jorge Lewis 
It's identical to the 10 weeks.

30:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
One more week for both the MEMS system and the TODO. I think that's two weeks.

31:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
The functionality I think will be more user-based.

31:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I think the functionality of the to-do will become easy because of the mems. What's the acronym for the other one? It's like three M's.

31:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Movie, Eat, Sleep, Mind. Oh, it's Mezum.

31:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's he typed the wrong one too. But yeah, the last one I sent to you Mezum, Movie, Eat, Sleep, Mind.

31:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hm.

31:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Do we do a kickoff today, then, or? Oh, Jorge just left. Oh, hi.

31:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Don't worry.

32:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, he's given another link.

32:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think I told him to join back. He just said like, okay, I sent the other link and I left and then you joined at the same time.

32:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
All right. No worries. Um, I want to, I want to kill my videos.

32:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, maybe us too. We may want to kill our videos just to improve the network.

32:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sure.

32:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so you're right, it is a big issue. So when someone registers, they will be asked questions by the boss or they'll fill it in on the form, which basically says what is your age, what's your sort of, there's various steps to working that, what's called your basic a metabolic rate, your BMR, and that would be your standard calorie consumption for maintenance. And then we would have a minimum of 1,200. There will be an absolute limit. We would basically never say anybody goes under 1,200 a day. So there will be a target established for each person. And then we would suggest applications like Cronometer, MyFitnessPal, where they can put in their foods, and then that would give them the calories which they would enter into this. And again, once you've done that for a week or two, once you've done that for a week or two, you broadly know what it is. Now, where we'd like to get to in the future is using the new visual abilities of the GPTs, is for them to take a photograph of a place And it basically gives you a good enough estimate of all the calories on the plate.

34:27 - Jorge Lewis 
No, not yet.

34:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll give it a go and let you know actually.

34:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it's manual at the moment, so there's metrics for time you go to sleep, time you wake up, and your subjective experience of the quality of it in phase one, so it's very simple. With all of these areas, we want to have some visualization of charts so people can see their trends over time, so for example, for sleep quality, we would be saying, right, how consistent are they going to bed at the same time, waking up at the same time, disruptive of that, is there any correlation between your walking and sleep, just subjective experience of sleep and diet, you know, so there is a set can see around each of these four areas around how good they're doing.

35:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now it's in the application dashboards under the Adapt Journey website. It's also in the wireframe as well. In the wireframe you mean the The wireframes are in the Google presentation document.

36:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
There will be a, yeah, no, absolutely.

36:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Every person who comes in will go through at least an hour's phone call, coaching call, to help them connect to understanding why they're doing that. We would like the, this is what we talked about, the immunity to change, where we can do some work with people to understand what's getting in the way.

36:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just want to try this.

37:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, maybe not. Most people are very techy and illiterate, so there's no guarantees that they would. But I think that's something that we'd like to be able to do in the future. So the fact that we're building a native application gives us that option in the future, but that's something that we need to take today.

37:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. Any other concerns from you, Jonas?

37:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, not really.

38:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not either or, it's both. So a person may log into the app and put it in themselves. They may log into the app and tell the browser.

39:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. Did you see the screenshot as well?

39:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, for the marketing show.

39:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

39:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so the idea is that If we can do this use case with uBots, then the rest of the solution is just multiple instances of this thing. And so we wanted to identify a very discrete use case. So the use case for this is running a brand values exercise with a new startup. So what that means is, what do you stand for? What are your values? And then that would impact your, you know, your tone of voice, your marketing, you know, what you stand for, all those sorts of things. Does that make sense?

40:15 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it was like two weeks ago, I had to do this myself without any help. So I'm quite familiar with the process now, or at least a little bit.

40:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, exactly. So it's not massively innovative, but I've facilitated these for years, so has JP, so has Arif. So the idea would be is that you'd have a, and again, this is our concept, you may have from an architectural and a technical point of view, a different way of doing this, but this is where We're sort of our current headset is so you would have a facilitator box Facilitator box knows how to run the process from A to Z. It knows all the steps It's happy to go around various steps and it knows It knows what the completion of a step is and before it can move to the next steps It's really really good of doing that and

41:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
As it's producing stuff in real time, the analyst bot will be looking at the outputs and either going to the market or going somewhere to analyze the integrity or the usefulness of that. So for example, today, that would be JP.

41:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, what is it, you said, and go to market with the values or?

41:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it might not You're a health startup, and your values are integrity, honesty, and something like this. You might then go and do some market analysis in real time, and go, actually, here's another company, which is also in the health space, and exactly the same values. So while they're okay values, they're not unique.

42:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
process, the analyst bot is then looking at applicability to the market as an example, and the parallel strategy bot will be looking as do those values align to the strategy that would have been an input into this process as an example. The idea is if we can get these three bots dancing with each other, And we did a lot of research yesterday. There does seem to be other people doing this, not in the marketing space, but doing it in the engineering space. So basically, you end up having a number of coders and testing bots working together to produce software. And it's very embryonic at the moment. I think, you know, bots doing 100% unassisted coding is not viable right now, but the concept is still true. So what we wanted to do was figure out you guys is how quickly could we do a proof of concept where we would have these three bots, where JP would then educate those bots on how to do their piece of the puzzle, and then have them dance with each other in order to get to an outcome. Because if we can prove those mechanics, then we can just repeat the pattern across different steps of his framework that he wants to use.

43:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you got, again, it might be a bad example, but the idea being is that if you've got a marketing strategy, which is to, you know, I don't know, I'm running out of ideas, but it would just have a different agenda to achieve.

44:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, can you say that again, the first part of your sentence?

45:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

45:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Did you just send one?

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

45:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I'll...

45:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Fundamentally to me it sounds like a plan that will work and the specifics of the bots would be more optimized over time than be perfect from the start.

46:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
the in any way intended to be the solution.

46:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it makes sense.

46:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, what about you? Does that sound cool? We can hop in a call sometime and try to just brainstorm.

46:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
What would be really useful for that brainstorm session would be, Cuan, if you could give us basically the step-by-step process of like each action item that you go through to like through the entire interaction with a client because I think what will probably be optimal here is having multiple group chats that take place in succession. So instead of having one that tries to do the entire thing, which can often lead down to inaccuracy over time just because of the butterfly effect, instead have one pipeline for one process, another pipeline to determine the next thing, and another pipeline.

47:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
That probably won't be feasible, because if I was to dictate how to facilitate the session, it would probably take me about a week, solidly, to define how that works. And maybe I'm wrong. The idea is...

47:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
There are overarching steps. So first, one of the tasks can be to determine the values that the company is proposing. And that will run for one group chat. So all those overarching steps, instead of telling one agent to do the entire thing, then it's giving you a task at a time.

48:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, but that's what we're trying to suggest here, is that the facilitator bot is its own agent, and it's just running the process. As that's producing content and dialogue with the user or users, the analyst part is watching that content and taking things of interest and then independently going and doing its own analysis and then coming back to that meeting and saying hey you said x I found something on the industry that says y so that's exactly what would happen in a meeting like if you go into a marketing agency you're going to have multiple people around the table you're going to have somebody running the meeting and as stuff evolves and emerges during that meeting you're going to put the people going i've heard about that before this is the only thing over here that's really interesting we should do that so These bots are participants in the meeting. They're not running the meeting. That makes sense. So yes, they would be looking and taking the content and then feeding ideas into that process as well.

49:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Looking at the example you sent, I think the mission statement workshop would be one group chat. And then the conclusion from that group chat would pass on to values identification workshop. Having like the more scoped you can have the task, the better the agents tend to perform. And of course, like they'll still be working off each other. There will be the three agents, one will be running the meeting and all of that, but it'll just be scoped to one overarching task at a time, if that makes sense.

49:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so.

50:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's take a step back. So this is not a strategy. That would be a pre-existing document.

50:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
You're cutting out for me?

50:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's say we take Tanya and my sister. Can you hear me now?

50:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, should be. 1, We are Yeah, 1, 2, then 1, cut out.

51:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's completely out now.

51:15 - Jorge Lewis 
A new Discord.

51:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Discord group chat call?

51:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can probably organize the overarching things with Cuan then.

51:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you guys hear me now? Yeah, yeah.

51:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, let me try again. Okay, so imagine my sister and my wife, who are owners of Adapt, and they've just started it, and they're trying to figure out what is the, they've read that they need to figure out what their brand value is, trying to get the brand of the company.

52:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
J.P.' 's company, and they would click on a button saying, establish your brand values. And they'd go, great. So the first boss would then say, hey, welcome. We're going to run a workshop. It's going to take about an hour. And please make sure that you've got access to the internet. And I would set up some contacts and say, OK, cool. So I'm now going to show you. Words on a screen, so my sister would see them, my wife would see them, and I said, and I want you to, it's going to be, let's say, two words, and I want you to click on the words that you feel are more important to you than less important. So there will be a word, two words have come up. Um, there's a really good, there's a really good, uh, car game I used to use with clients called the brand deck that does this. So I have all the content for this. And so you basically just go, we are more of this than we are that we're more of this than we are that. And so you end up having all these words and you're just clicking them. Yeah. And so you end up having a pool of words that I picked that Sonya picked and my sister picked, and then you say, right.

53:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
be a review of that and say, right, here's the top 10, here's all the words that you've all picked. Here's the themes of those words. And then there'll be some digestion of those words to say, right, you know, what makes this good? If you want like between three and five words that really, really speak to you. And so the facilitator would be grouping those, trying them on, going backwards and forwards until you get to the people who are comfortable in parallel. Again, maybe the context doesn't make sense of this. The analyst bot will be looking at those, looking at the industry, doing something else in parallel, going, you know, are they compatible? Do they make sense? And we can figure out what the right role for these other different bots are. Maybe the strategy bot doesn't make any sense in this meeting because you're not, you know, any values can be aligned to a strategy, so there's no way to discern good ones or bad ones. The idea just wasn't one of multiple bots playing a role to see if we can get it to work. Then you would take those grand values and then the next part would be to figure out what is your mission statement. And what we would do is we would each write for 10 minutes just everything and everything that comes to mind about what we're trying to do, why we're trying to achieve it. The facilitator would then take those three and distill them down into sort of five key sentences and saying, based on what you've said, This is the five key sentences or objectives you're trying to achieve. Now, then I would take them and I would rewrite them with the values, the brand values that they talk about. And then you'd have five areas. We would do some round of voting or trying them on and just a backwards and forward conversation to the point where you've got a single line item. So for example, with Adapt, the strapline that we've done so far we don't have the second half that is adapt is about preventing the preventables so that something we don't have the second half not sometimes So when I used to do organizational design, my strapline was, I want to create organizations that I'd be happy for my kids to work in. That was my litmus of success when I went in and did organizational design. And when I would say that to people, they'd be like, shit, I totally understand what you mean. I know the standard I would want for a company. And by the way, there's very few companies I'd be happy for my kids to work in because most of them are fucking shit.

55:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
good strapline is, it's emotive, it's understandable, it's punchy, it's very clear what it is. So the outcome of this workshop is their line, so you've got your brand values and you've got your brand mission. Once you get those two things, this workshop is finished. This workshop is completely finished. So you might have a copywriter bot who's taking those brand values, seeing what they said no to, seeing what they said yes to, also looking at sentences that we came up with, the voting that we said, everything that we said in the meeting, and then draft 10 versions of those sentences. And so that's why you've got different bots doing slightly different things and contributing to the workshop in a very dynamic way.

57:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
there'll be a number of bots, so imagine in the end solution, I would basically create the concept of a workshop. Within a workshop, I can create inputs, I can create bots, and then each bot would have a role, and we would generate personalities, and we would have prompts against that bot.

57:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I don't know, and this is probably a question for you, Jonas, is can a bot follow an actual process? Because for me, bots are very emergent. All they're really doing is guessing the next best word. So can we actually get to the point where a bot will formally follow a process that has multiple steps and really drive to an outcome?

57:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that is possible, yeah.

57:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
So that's why I mentioned having multiple group chats for each overarching points, because that ensures that the overarching points get, like, yeah, that they go through them, because if there's a process within a process, that's when they usually start

58:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
to struggle. Yeah, you tell us the best way of achieving these items, but what we're trying to do is strip away, what we're trying to do is, is do a proof of concept on this, see if we can get it to work. If we can get it to work, then you'll get a lot more business from JP in order to build out the full product.

58:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the question I have for you guys is, what is the quickest, dirtiest proof of concept? Because this proof of concept is never going to see the light of day. He might show it to people just to bring it to life, but he needs to know that you guys can build something that's going to let him achieve his vision.

59:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, proof-of-concept is just as we're built with WordPress.

59:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

59:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could you send an example workshop that you want us to proof-of-concept? Like, just your outline of it?

59:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
What I just talked through.

59:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it could be that or any, like, just a workshop that you want us to...

59:32 - Jorge Lewis 
We'll do that one, yeah. Go on, Ian.

59:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
into getting brand values and a mission statement for a small startup.

59:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay, cool. So, does JPA have Discord?

59:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm sure you can install it very quickly.

59:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, we have a group chat on Discord just now. You can add him to the group chat and we can go through with the discussion there.""","""Cuan x Jorge x Jonas, Sixth Transcript.txt"""

0:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Test test.

1:36 - Jorge Lewis 
You want to invite them over?

1:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

1:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
But are you going to answer what I said in our internal chat?

1:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
In where?

1:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Our admin chat, the one I have to be in.

1:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh.

2:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Just both work.

2:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

2:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I talked to David, he said, yeah, there's no really legal concerns.

2:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, that's nice.

2:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've sent the link, by the way, so they can join in. Hey, how's it going?

2:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Welcome.

2:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Good morning.

2:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
How goes it?

2:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is JP joining?

2:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Should be, yeah.

2:52 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you split your calls? Like, your schedule?

3:00 - Jorge Lewis 
In what regard?

3:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So for me, having calls every single day, like where there's like 10 minutes between a call, 30 minutes between a call, between a call, it's not very productive. So what I'm trying to do now is, oh, JP's here. Now we can talk about another time. Hey, JP, you there?

3:20 - Jonathan Phillips 
Morning. Morning. Or evening.

3:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool.

3:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we've only got 10 minutes, so this obviously feels like a Birmingham issue for you guys. Um, so if you can explain and give me the context, um, obviously from, you know, where my head's at is I don't want to present risk to, to, to my startup and my business. That's, that's the, that's the bit I'm trying to do. And I think, There is, I don't think you're intentionally ever trying to do that, but there might be unintended impacts that we need to explore. So appreciate the transparency as it should be. Yeah.

4:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
You want to lead in Jorge?

4:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes. I mean, our point of view is for this review feature, we'd like to be able to make a number one, make a better version of it. That's, um, that's more modular that we can implement into different projects more easily. Um, but also open source it.

4:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So those two things are, are, are separate, um, things. They're not the same. So making something open source or not is, is one question. And then you, you as a company, um, taking this capability that we've created, what's your intention behind creating a modular version? What's the point of doing that? Are you looking to put that out on the market? Are you looking to open source that? What's the intention behind it? Is it to build reputation? Is it to make revenue? What's the purpose behind it?

5:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So a couple. Number one, open sourcing. We're passionate about the open source community. We feel pride being able to publish things to GitHub. So there's that. But also we'd be reusing it in our projects. For example, REST. There is a version of reviews in there already. Sorry, REST is the Read.AI tool that I use for sales. There's already a version of reviews that we have existing in there since I made it that we'd like to spend some time improving. And since we realize all of our apps use a form of reviews, we can standardize and make a version that's more modular for all of our projects.

5:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
So can we just define reviews, please? I'm a bit lost with what documents.

5:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So with LLMs, there's something called few shots, which is where you give it examples to tell it, hey, here's an example. I want you to bathe in this way. And that's very standard across LLMs. And yeah, so that we've pretty much made in.

6:05 - Jorge Lewis 
For that, we've made a custom interface for providing reviews. We call them reviews since we have an example message and then we can provide, hey, you did a good job here. You didn't do a good job here. Pretty much.

6:17 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's a way to provide feedback to the system.

6:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
So from my perspective, I fully understand having worked with software companies for many moons, open source, proprietary, call it what you will, and know exactly what you need as a business in order to enhance your reputation, but also just join in with the community because it feels good to help the community. It feels good to contribute to, let's face it, you get a lot from the open source community given to you. So it's nice to give back because you're taking a lot. So fully understand that. I think the only reservation that we have is ultimately that we create something let's say we create some IP and that IP then gets used by other people to gazumpas basically. So we put all the effort in to create something and then another company sees something and says right okay I'll use that in my project and bang they're up to speed with us yet they haven't thought about it before yet they didn't have a way to implement it before. So all these reservations may be unfounded we may be sort of like what you're trying to propose is something that is not going to harm us at all. But our reservation is immediately defensive, so we want to protect what we have. But that doesn't necessarily mean we're right. So we just have to work through what elements we are sharing and what potential harm they can do to us. So I think that's in a nutshell.

8:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
So a couple of questions I have, and I like that. I think JP encapsulates perfectly where my concerns lie.

8:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
The idea of you guys creating a modular version that then gets extended over time and we benefit from, which I think is one of your messages.

8:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
How does that work in reality? Because if that, you know, a positive upgrade can have all sorts of breaking changes. So there's no guarantee that we could actually take advantage of any new feature because it might- Why would it have breaking changes?

8:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry?

8:40 - Jorge Lewis 
If it has breaking changes, then it doesn't fulfill its purpose. If we're making an improvement, it's to improve. I don't get what you mean.

8:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but if you've got a review thing in Adapt, in IntelliAgent, in Workshop Builder, in five of your products, let's say we're on eight products, the chances of you making an upgrade to that and it working seamlessly across all eight products is unlikely. So therefore, every time you make a change, every integration, Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how software works these days. But my understanding is, as you'd enhance a core component independently of the applications that they're used in, there is a risk that you add a new capability and it breaks something in the app if it was deployed.

9:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not like you're deploying to an operating system where it's known. You're deploying to an application. And all those applications are not the same. Sorry, Jonas, your hand's up, mate.

9:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
So we'd be creating a separate application, which has basically an API that can be called for creating reviews, modifying reviews, and using reviews in those agents. And through our projects, REST, ADAPT, and Workshop Builder now, it's a very similar use case, and like all of them, how it's implemented and used, and those endpoints would remain the same. So that's not really a concern since creating reviews, which have the examples, the properties, they can be optional properties that won't conflict across the projects. And for the time it takes to modify, adapt, or workshop builder to work with the new system, we'd be like implementing that no cost to you.

10:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
So from your own company point of view, are you going to open source every single thing you build for yourselves?

10:44 - Jorge Lewis 
The term open source, we like to use the word open source because it's very popular, but most likely business sourcing a lot of things using the business source license. That just prevents other people from using it from a business capacity. For sharing the source code publicly, I'm pretty comfortable for sharing our own code for things we make publicly because I understand that if people want to use my code, the I provide really very little value for my code, because it's so custom to what I'm doing, and to my tech stack, and to the way I do things, that if they wanted to apply in a business sense, they're better off making it themselves. And I understand that from a technical point of view. I've tried using other people's GitHub repositories. It's just not very practical.

11:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Could we separate out the decision into two stages? And I've got to go in literally a minute. There's the agreement between us and your company to work collaboratively together is one aspect. And I think there is value that myself and JP as consumers of your services and your products could contribute to ideas to evolve this review panel because we're in theory part of your customer base in terms of what we could do. So it would be certainly interesting to be part of that journey to understand how we might extend it and build it and work collaboratively. The second part is about making that open source. My concern is just unilaterally making everything open sources. Do you guys know the origins of Slack and how that came about?

12:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Not the origins, no. I know Salesforce acquired them, that's about it.

12:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
They were basically a remote dev shop, quite a bit bigger than you guys, but they were a remote dev shop and they found that they were struggling with communication, So they built a little console just to make it easier for them, because they couldn't find anything on the market. They got into significant financial trouble, and the CEO basically said, right, we're fucked. Is there anything we've built for anybody or ourselves that we think there might be an opportunity to market it? And that's where Slack came from They were basically, they had to pivot the organization away from being a dev shop into a product company that had built something for themselves and very fortunate. Had they open sourced that they'd be in quite a bit of trouble as a company. They would have like exposed themselves. So I suppose I'm taking, I'm, it's an interesting, we're coming at it from very different points of view, which I think is good. I think it helps the, you know, you, you guys have been brought up on open source. I work in organizations where like you're spending 15 million buying software. What the fuck do you think I want to open source? There's no way you're going to open. If you build something for a consultancy, they're like, there's no fucking way. If you even suggested open sourcing, they'd fire you. Because you've just given away my IP. No way. And so there's two parts of the conversation for me. I'm sorry, Bob. I need to go. If you're happy to stay on, can you guys continue the chat and see if we can jump back? I might not. This call is due for an hour. It might only be 15 minutes. But I'll let you guys know.

14:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Sounds good. Thanks for putting us in. See ya.

14:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. I say it's tricky because we all have our own interests at heart. We all want something. And it's just a case of merging those things together to get a compromise that everyone's happy with because a couple of them might be competing. So we just need to make sure that we're all happy going forward.

14:32 - Jonathan Phillips 
But go ahead, Jonas.

14:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely. Just to address the concern that Cuan had, that's one we've had before, especially for like Itino, the platform we were building before. We want to be able to develop open source without the scare of a big company just taking our solutions and placing more developers on it. That's why It's technically not open source, it's available source, which means the source code is available and anyone can run it privately. But if you're a company and you want to deploy the codes we've available sourced in production, you have to get our permission, basically.

15:14 - Jonathan Phillips 
So that's where I'm very cynical. So I'm Mr.

15:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
I see people doing nefarious things all the time. So in that respect, what I would do as a bad actor, as someone who has sort of mischievous, I would take that code and currently, I don't know if it's possible, but certainly with AI tools, you can say, can you manipulate that code to make it different enough to do the same, provide the same output, but modify the code. And then I could say, what's my code? It's not your code, and I'm going to use it in my business. So that would be an element of, we need to guard against that, because I don't believe that everybody out there is fair and honest.

16:00 - Jorge Lewis 
To even go on that step further is they don't even need to change the code. The chances of me asking for an audit of their code is like so slim, especially at a big level.

16:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm just talking about, for example, if we developed a system, a platform, and then the competitor who came from nowhere launches the platform a month later, And you go, hang on a minute, that's very similar to ours. You couldn't have built it that quickly. And then we see certain legal papers, we get to inspect their code, and it's delivering functionally everything that we've got. And they just got up to speed in minutes. So that's the guard that we just want to make sure that we don't get into that position. And I completely sympathize where you guys are coming from So I'm not like suggesting that what you're doing is wrong or incorrect at all, because it's what you want to do. So we're happy with that. It's just a case of how we go about and maybe what we actually deliver. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. My brother started coding many years ago and he basically built most of his platforms on open source. So he came into my business and we had hundreds of customers, hundreds of platforms we built based on open source code. So I fully comply with the whole ethos of open source. But from a selfish perspective I want to have a chance to maybe build a couple of platforms that will be commercially successful and one of the checks against that is competition and barriers to enter so that they can't enter quickly and of course people copy straight away and I fully appreciate that people could reverse engineer something quite quickly, but they don't have to take the code, I realise that. It's just, I think, giving them a head start, I think that maybe is the concern. But again, it depends on, like you say, if you modulise it and you can't necessarily make anything from that module, then that's fine, because because all you're doing is sort of improving the function rather than the platform itself. And I fully understand that. And I think that's where the compromise will be. There'll be elements that can be used in isolation that you can't necessarily build from quickly to create an equivalent platform. So that's where my head is.

18:21 - Jorge Lewis 
My opinion on this is that, and I think it's reflected in the fact that A lot of companies right now are making their projects open source, especially, which is obvious, developer-focused companies, but even non-developer-focused companies. And so my thought, just a little thought experiment is, if you're targeting developers that know how to code, and your project's open source, so what's stopping those good developers from just copying your code or taking your repository and doing the exact same thing? Nothing really, the only thing is just that, what makes that startup, that startup is not the code itself because if you put enough men and enough money behind something, you can get the same code, like the same outcome. But it's really the people behind it, I believe. And I think that opinion is reflected in the fact that all these companies, one of my favorite ones are just like Superbase, for example, where they're completely open source and they're still very profitable.

19:25 - Jonathan Phillips 
I agree, I agree and I'm not suggesting that open source is the wrong direction at all, it's just the way we do it. But just to give you a silly example of where sort of my cynicism comes in, so a couple of years ago I stopped with this business but for 17 years I had a business selling reflux wedges, not very exciting, pops babies up in cots so the baby doesn't regurgitate milk and acid so basically they sleep at an angle. Simple as that. Nothing too exciting. We ended up manufacturing foam wedges with different covers on, different properties, etc. Very good business and we ended up being pretty much the biggest in the world for what we did. So quite successful. And then a company in the UK took our website seriously took the website and all the words and started their own business a few miles down the road. So we obviously had to stop that from happening, but they made a lot of money quite quickly by just dipping in, stealing what we had and immediately operating and then stopping. So that's where the cynicism comes with comes from And I'm not suggesting that that's possible with what you're suggesting at all. Absolutely not. But it's just that the mindset and the same with Cuan as well, we've seen people misbehave. So we just have reservations to start with. That's all.

20:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Go ahead, Jonas.

20:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
With how we'd be open sourcing it, as you mentioned, it will be in quite a modular way. Our company will always be the ones that know the code we've open sourced best. We know how to implement it. How to implement it won't be too obvious to anyone else. There's quite a lot of effort into turning those modules into something that's practically usable in something like a Turning a review system into a marketing workshop thingy is quite a lot of effort. The review system, it took us a week to develop the one that is currently working in the depths. If there's a bigger company than ours, they won't have an issue. It's more like, as Jorge mentioned, the developers behind it. Understanding behind it. If we're able to create this review system in a unified way, which we use for all our projects, I think it will be a much better review system than what other companies will be able to create trying to mimic us compared to copying our code, which I don't think they do successfully in any way. And if it's a big company, they don't want to risk the legal issues behind breaking our license and all of that.

22:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
I agree. And in theory, I think we just have to maybe see an example so that it sort of appeases Cuan's concerns, etc. I mean, I think the skill in what we're doing anyway is the input, not necessarily the coding, not even the development, it's the input to make it special, the system prompts, the codifying the expertise, that is the, to me, the differentiator so as you say people can just turn up and get a team of 50 developers together and say okay over the weekend we're going to create this platform and it's possible and it would be very similar to another platform so I understand completely that it doesn't even by not releasing it it doesn't mean that someone can't copy your website, your application when they see it because they can just reverse engineer it. I don't understand that at all but I just think we need to maybe, you propose an example to us and show us what's being shared for example and then we go hey that's fine, that's not a problem at all. So I think that might be the way forward.

23:20 - Jorge Lewis 
So to answer that actually right now, so for the reviews for example, reviews is a pretty traditional approach to, or sorry, few short examples. So providing examples to LLMs has been done for a while. The front end, we do it. It's just the way we've done it. There's like, you can do it anyway, really. But the reviews itself is not what gives like the value. It's your, it's the fact that you are giving these reviews. So the reviews, It's actually a great example because it's not the reviews functionality that's powerful. It's the actual data that goes into them.

23:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think it comes all down to the whole reason we kind of went with this angle as a business where we're targeting to work with subject matter experts because me and Jorge and our developers, we can sit down and implement systems all day, but if we're not collaborating with someone that has how much experience you guys have in your fields that can help us formulate these products, then the technology isn't providing any value, it's how it's implemented to make your guys' solutions, which are the proprietary solutions. Which provides the real value. The review system provides no value unless you have a combination of the subject matter experts being you guys and a team of technology guys being us that can help implement it together.

24:48 - Jonathan Phillips 
I completely agree and what makes sense the most is that as a collaboration you guys have got to achieve your goals as well so we're not here to stop you sort of achieving your dreams you've got to go for that and the better you are at doing that the better our product because we're working together. So that helps us. So what we don't want to do is stop your, reduce the passion, stop the momentum. We want you to build sort of your future together, so to speak. And that's something that maybe we haven't discussed in more detail, you know, what you guys want. Over the next year, over the next five years, et cetera. So, so there's stuff that we can do to help you and springboard you guys forward. Cause obviously you're building something for us, which is brilliant. Thank you very much. But you know, at the same time we can help you more.

25:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I appreciate that very much. Um, yeah, totally agree. Um, it's like we, we've got your guys's experience, but we've got our experience and it's just, it's a combo, you know, little one, two, Make some money.

25:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, that's the bottom line, isn't it? Obviously, we need to make some money. But, you know, I always say it's the journey, not the destination. So making the money enables us to have a better journey. But we've got to enjoy this ride because, you know, you don't realize it's gone. Until it's gone. So, you know, this, this is, we're all doing something we love and that's, that's important. And we unfortunately won't be able to do that every day of our lives. Um, you work on projects that are a bit boring. You work on projects that are going down a dead end. So in the moment, I think we're all doing something that we think is really beneficial and enjoying and really enjoying it. So I think that we need to sort of tap into that and we need to all make sure we're, we're achieving our goals, but really enjoying the ride as well.

26:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Precisely.

26:48 - Jonathan Phillips 
Cool. Okay. Um, I mean, I've got nothing more to say really.

26:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, um, we can, if you've got time, we can go through those questions that you put up.

26:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, sure. Yes. Do that. Yeah, of course.

27:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah.

27:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Want to find them now.

27:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. Yeah.

27:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so so just pretty much get an idea of of milestones really I think that's the goal.

27:12 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah Yeah, so let me give you an overview again because we we've been dipping in and out of lots of things So let me just tell you from my perspective Um So I had this idea years ago. So this is not new for me. I wanted to codify my expertise. And originally, we're going back years now, the way that I tried to do it was through traditional HTML development and do a wizard. So I called it a wizard at the time. That's what websites called them, but people throw in some information, it then branches and you end up with something at the end. So that was the top technology. You couldn't really do much more than that. So now the whole AI thing is just mind-blowing. It enables to do some amazing stuff. So that's all very exciting. But in order to do that, we've got to have something that is a little bit unique. So I developed the marketing frameworks which are not necessarily completely unique because what I've done is I've pulled together what I think is the best way to approach a small business to approach their whole marketing business strategy. So I've cobbled together all my thoughts, modern thinking and I'm ripping away the traditional way of working. So nearly all companies go out there and they go like you guys would, you go online and look for a template for a marketing plan or business plan or look for traditional models and start filling them in. Really boring, really tedious, you get halfway, you stop doing it, you've got work to do, you get bored and also a lot of these rely on data and small businesses don't have data. You have a bit of maybe website sort of stats, sales stats. You don't have data on the industry or your competition. You really don't. You're making it up. So I've tried to build a system that doesn't rely on all the traditional things. So immediately, it's a different approach. Which hopefully will be unique enough for people to jump onto. And my whole theme is storytelling. So the whole thing from beginning of your marketing plan to the end of your plan is all about narrative and storytelling. And I managed to create every single level of marketing and business within it have a storytelling, not a theme, because it's not like once upon a time, but the whole ethos and principle is of telling your story, telling your product story. So there's various elements of that. But anyway, I won't go into the detail. So we have this unique platform. And I want to target organizations that don't do marketing or business. So, your landscape gardener, your cleaning service, people who have a passion for the business they want to start, but have no clue. They might not even have a laptop. So, they really don't know where to start. They start by talking to people saying, or going door to door, do you want my service? So, I want to build something that will enable them to give them a strategy of how to go out there and do things they don't know about now. So, that's the idea. So I just simply want the ability for somebody to go onto the web, whether it's a smartphone or a laptop, and start to talk to a system. And they don't have to fill a template in. They start talking in their terms, in their language, and it helps them along the journey. So all I need is these various bots or agents to work in unison to give them, for their individual personalized lifestyle, what they need. And on top of that, obviously the gubbins at the back, the whole agent system, is a wrapper that looks relatively attractive. It doesn't have to be amazing.

31:04 - Jonathan Phillips 
That's the goal, the whole goal, but in the short term I need to have something to go to prospective partners, to even customers, just to try and refine things. So at the moment it's difficult because it's conceptual and I talk to them and they go, yeah it's great, don't really know what you're talking about, but hey I'll buy into it. Something to go, hey, you have a go. You type in or speak into it and see what you think and that's what I need. And I've spoken to a number of people a few months ago when I was trying to get some buzz around and some support as in like, is this a good idea or not? And those people are now coming back to me saying, hey, how are you getting on? Can I have a go? I kind of like, I'm getting itchy feet. I just really want to show them something. So my sort of opinion at the moment is the workshop builder needs refining and that's fine. So what I want is a refined version of what we have now with a wrapper on top, a window that looks semi-attractive, just your standard chat GPT, Claude type thing, you know, nothing flash at all, where I can go to someone and say, right, go and type in. And then at the end of the conversation, they will get their unique value proposition. So there's no documents to output as such. We're not doing chain of, um, sort of workshops that build together to build a plan at the moment. That's obviously downstream. I just want the conversational window so that at the end, because the, the, the output is the conversation. And at the end, they come up with a UVP or the agents do so to speak with the user. So that's, that's all I want. And I know it's a big ask, so to speak, but at the moment that I've really sort of tried to refine my requirements so we can get it done as soon as possible.

32:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Now that we have the workshop builder, instead of building the workshop custom for you, I have one thought after also going through the workshop, a very tiny version with you and Cuan. I think it may be smart with trying to, in the workshop builder, design the brand purpose workshop first, because it's much simpler in terms of paths it can go down. And it may be, I think it's easier for you to get a refined version of the brand purpose workshop that you can start going around and demoing than the UVP workshop, which will probably require more complex segment switching and more complex, mostly everything.

33:40 - Jonathan Phillips 
I understand. I fully understand. Although I think the UVP workshop has 10 times more value than the brand purpose workshop from a business perspective. So for example, every single business out there needs a UVP. And if they've got one, or they think they've got one, it's probably wrong. They need a better one. So I could approach any business or any company founder and basically say, Hey, I want this tool here. It's going to improve your business like that. I say, we've got a brand purpose workshop. Some people don't even know what brand means. They don't have, or they have their logos and they have what they think their brand is. And they're not going to be able to take anything from the output and improve their business with it. So from my perspective, that's what you VP was quite useful.

34:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
To comment on that, when you first presented the brand purpose workshop, I was in the same position, which almost made it, when running through the tiny version with you guys, even more impactful, because it's making me realize stuff that I didn't even think about. Everyone thinks about the UVP. No one really thinks about a brand purpose. So when you're running for a workshop and understand, wow, this, this hair, this is really important. I think that's like a special feeling, which I've never gotten from, like, would be very impressive to get from AI, if that makes sense.

35:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sure, sure. No, no, I take that on board, fully take that on board. Um, my, my, my perspective is that obviously I wouldn't call it a UVP because that is jargon and technical term. I would build it into a, your, your, your business meaning or have it parted up. I'd have it sort of more enticing than that. Um, but let me have a little think about that on how we approach it. And if you could, if you could give me some, just some very rough, um, indication of How long the brand purpose workshop will take to build and how long the uvp workshop? Would help be useful.

35:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think it's up to us to Like we're adding the features to the workshop builder and we'll eventually make a front then specifically for the work for intelligence uh uvp workshop But until we're starting with making the specific content for IntelliAgent, I think it's like you can get, just using the workshop builder, you can get a demo-able version of the brand workshop, brand purpose workshop, without losing any time on the UVP workshop. The goal with IntelliAgent's development can be the UVP workshop, but in the meantime, using the workshop builder, you can make a demo of the brand purpose workshop that you can present.

36:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I mean, my sort of I use the term demo, which is useful because obviously if I'm in person, I can show them and take them through it. But I also want something to sort of broadcast. I want something to say to someone so it works in its entirety without me there. So that's also a short-term goal. So I can basically get hundreds of people to test it, if not thousands, and even use it as a sort of lead magnet to get more interest for when we develop the system further. So I know that this is all sort of building blocks to achieving the end goal. And it's a case of, at what point do we want to say, that's the milestone, that's what we're aiming for, and we've completed it. So I know the milestones are moving like this. And every time we suggest something, it's something more complicated or less complicated. And it's moving all the time, which isn't helpful, I understand.

37:27 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think you're right. So the key is for us to put the data in, the information in, the knowledge in, in order with the existing structure to make it more powerful. And that's absolutely fine. And something I'm doing at the moment is the On the segments, Kuhn had this chart with the various sort of system inputs, system prompts. I'm going to take that apart. So at the moment, it's not good enough because it's pretty much a lot of generic sort of...

38:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think the agents aren't smart enough. To actually deliver what we want. I need them to be a lot more granularity, a lot more layers of complexity with their thinking and what they're trying to achieve. And I don't think we have that at the moment. So that's what I'm going to, hopefully by the end of today, I'll have something for you and Cuan to have a look at.

38:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
I agree with that, but I think it's also can be harmful to try to go too deep into the details of getting the granularity to begin with it without even having like the foundation of the building in place kind of I think it's easier to add granularity over time afterwards than try to be super specific, for example, in the prompts to begin with, and then that's much harder to debug which fundamental aspects are wrong if you've already put in every single piece of detail.

38:50 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's easier to add detail than remove it. But what I can do is if I produce what I think is the end goal, you can then maybe chunk it and say we'll try this first and try that and try that because at least you'll have a vision of where we want to go to because it's a lot more complicated than what we have at the moment. So what we want to do is produce something that is difficult to emulate so someone else cannot come along and have agents as intelligent as ours and as expert as ours, because ultimately, there's going to be hundreds of these systems. There's going to be hundreds and hundreds. And we want to have the one that everybody goes, wow, that is so accurate and so perceptive and so clever. And all the others I've used are just generic. They just don't seem to deliver something special. And it's that X factor that I think we can do by engineering the agents to be a lot smarter.

39:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I want to go into this, I guess we can call it the first version of the app that you want to send out to users. So you mentioned as a lead magnet, is that where you're leaning towards?

40:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
I want everything tomorrow. So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to basically shoehorn anything we can do in our journey and make use of it.

40:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
To build some momentum.

40:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, yeah.

40:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
When I say lead magnet, even if it's not a lead as in like they're going to buy it as such, it could be a lead magnet as in like they want to use it in the future or they want to partner with us or they want to use the technology or they just want a conversation because it's interesting. So all that will generate generate momentum, as you suggest, and that will get the project going. And at the moment, we're kind of a little bit stalled because I'm talking smoke and mirrors to people, and they can't really get a grasp and a physical presence of what the app's going to do. So that's where I'm sort of dancing between at the moment, talking a load of, well, excitement to people, and I want them to see something and have something as soon as possible to say, hey, yes, I see what you're talking about.

41:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's smart to run the mission and mission workshop probably as soon as possible, because when we have that end goal, it's easier to create a roadmap of the versions, not with dates or anything, but just like how to hop from version to version with how much more complicated features per version. So from that, we can figure out, will the first version literally just be a shared interface with this workshop or these two workshops? Or how much to add per version? What speeds up the process? What slows down the process?

41:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
Exactly, exactly. And I said this all along and this is where sort of Incura may differentiate in our our philosophies let's say he's from a corporate background I'm not so I'm very much from small startup and we have something we want to do we go and do it we don't look for problems we look for solutions and we just build whacky the popcorn machine. So lots of ideas, lots of things flying around and you've got to actually sort of manage that. So a lot of Cuan's skills I admire because he helps me manage my ideas but he's also sometimes a little too strict and a little too formal on what he wants. So I see the idea of having a roadmap and saying hey we want an amazing platform at the end and this is how it's going to look. So that's okay that's no problem where he's very reserved about the journey and he doesn't want to get too far ahead but me I want to see the end goal and how do we get there and how do we then sort of like chunk it in order to get there and you learn so much from that because you find halfway through that there's actually a shortcut to the end which if you didn't have the end point you'd never get to there because you don't know where your shortcut is to. So yes, I think that's exactly what we need to do. We're getting ahead of ourselves, but I do think we need a vision. And I think we need, and you guys certainly need it, because how can you help with the initial development not knowing where it's going to end up? That goes without saying.

43:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

43:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Do we do an hour?

43:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
All stakeholders should be present in the mission.

43:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I mean also another thing is that the way I work personally is I like to go away and think. And report, so to speak. So Cuan's very much in the moment, let's do a workshop, let's bash it out, et cetera, whereas that isn't necessarily my style. I don't mind talking through things, but I also feel that at the end, and I go away and think, and I think, well, half of that isn't relevant, or I've got so much more to add to it, and what I like to do is just do it once. So it just needs a bit of thinking time, and then we can sort of go through it, so to speak.

44:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely. I'll send you the recording of our mission, the prep workshop I did, because it's quite a while since it now, in case you need a refresher. Yeah, cool.

44:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Just so I can go away and think as well, what's missed? Because I haven't used the Workshop Builder in depth yet. What's it lacking for it to be able to produce a UVP workshop?

44:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
Nothing. I mean, except because I tried to do that, but we've had a few technical issues, um, which are anything to do with the workshop itself, but to do with the platform. And once we through the little technical issues, there's nothing, absolutely nothing that will stop us.

45:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So, so like, cause the way I thought of, I heard it from before is that we're kind of like, pretty far off to reaching the capability to make the UDP workshop, but it's just bugs and technical problems.

45:14 - Jonathan Phillips 
Absolutely. So, so, so ultimately I just want a process which we have with our steps or segments. Um, we throw in a number of specialist agents and that's it. I mean, that's fundamentally where I'm at. And then if we built something, a little window, a little wrapper on it so that people could look at it and not see the Let's say behind the scenes, then that's it. That's really, and that's, and that's what I was saying about the fact that we're nearly there. We're actually so nearly been able to show people something in its entirety. Um, and it's almost just, it's within reach. So that's why it's exciting. Um, and it doesn't have to be perfect by any means. It can be just as long as good enough. That's, that's the key thing. Um, and then I can get people excited about the ideas. Um, and hopefully, you know, we can then sort of get that momentum going on a business sense.

46:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, when you mentioned that, I think a lot of the granularity, I think you'll be looking for in the agent responses and in their expertise and how basically not sounding like AI. I think a lot of that will come from when the review system is also implemented. But before the review system is implemented, I think you can get down at least the foundations of how the workshop runs through. They may sound like AI. Certainly, I can do that for you. The classics sound like Shachipiti. I think Cuan told me, like you also mentioned to him, it very much sounds like Shachipiti now. I think that's where the review system will come in, because that's when you can just speak into a microphone and give examples of the improved responses, how they should sound.

47:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's another thing that we differ on. My approach is conversational with an AI engine. I talk to it as if it's human, as if it's an assistant or a friend next to me, whereas Cuan talks to it like a machine. And by talking to it as a machine, he gets the machine back. So what I try and do is talk to it as a person and then get the personal, because AI is not dumb, as we know, and it will respond in a manner that it thinks it's been spoken to. So I use please and thank you. Even when I'm talking to Alexa, I'll use please and thank you. It might not functionally be a massive difference, but it helps my approach. It helps my psyche when I'm talking, that I start to give the human element to it, which it'll then hopefully mimic that back.

47:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
So, so, so yeah, I think the key thing of the system prompts, which we put in the fields anyway, it doesn't matter about the coding as such. So those system prompts are what I'm really trying to hone down. So the agent has a set of instructions. So that's really what I think is a massive differentiator, but that doesn't, that's independent of the coding. You know, it doesn't really matter. It's the training, the tweaking, the expertise we give it is really where it becomes special.

48:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so then the last part is just figuring out how we would make it into its own app. So the workshop builder is its own thing. Jonas, how hard would it be to just kind of put on its own URL or where it's just the chat interface?

48:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, it's going to be a bit of work, which will be exposing the like endpoint, well, basically just the send message endpoint and connecting it with the profiles unique to the application. But that's work that's going to be, uh, have to be done anyways. And once that's done, it's done for the workshop.

49:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Like the, the project injection dependency injection thing where we have to interact with the actual projects database and stuff like that.

49:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

49:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

49:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

49:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Okay.

49:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
So basically just that, but after that, it's just copying over the chat interface, adding in the Intel agent logo instead of the logo, adding in the colors of Intel agents instead of a depth and then just exposing the chat so that they can't accidentally wander into that panel. And then we're done.

49:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep.

49:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, JP, do you have, do you use Dribbble?

49:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
I know of it and I probably have downloaded it or used it and registered and then not used it again. So the answer is no, but I am familiar with it.

49:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

49:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, you could use a tool like that, like any platform to get inspiration. You can send, you can make a mood board on the FigJam. So we can get an idea of what you're aiming for in terms of that. The UI framework we're using is pretty rigid. It looks like very app-like, system-like UI. We can make it look a little bit towards what you're trying to get. Obviously, that will be done later in the end. But just to get an idea, I think it would be helpful.

50:16 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sure, sure. So originally the idea that we'd have something similar to Claude where you have your chat and then your artifacts and your documents on the right. What I want initially is forget the right hand side, no artifacts, no documents and just a window. So ultimately that's really our first, let's say our first draft, that's going to be something that we can take and people can play with and Ultimately, like chat GPT, you delete the chat. It's gone. You know, we don't want people necessarily to do anything with it. They just got to play with it and go, wow, maybe, maybe they'll copy the UVP statement at the end or whatever the output is. And then it's done.

50:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

51:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. What are your thoughts on the, just the current chat interface though?

51:06 - Jonathan Phillips 
There's no, there's no, no problem. It's black. I'm not a big fan of black.

51:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think that's a generational thing. I like it to be light and airy. That's my go-to.

51:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Do you want plain white or do you want a slight tint of white?

51:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
You're going to spoil me now with a few shades, are you? That's nice. At the moment, I don't know, but what I can do is I can find some examples, some very simple examples and say, I like that. That'll do. So I can't explain it, but I know what it's like in my head, kind of

51:47 - Jorge Lewis 
We'll do some few shop reviews with the examples you give us.

51:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

51:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. No worries. No worries.

51:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

51:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So should we schedule the vision and mission workshop for some time?

52:05 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, we can do that.

52:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool.

52:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, I'm wondering if there's anything we can start working on other than the workshop builder to try to see if we can move IntelliAgent faster.

52:23 - Jonathan Phillips 
So just quickly as well, I've spoken to a number of people and We've decided, or I've decided, that it's Intel-agent rather than Intelli-agent, just on the virtue that there's no I in the middle.

52:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's how we've been pronouncing it internally.

52:45 - Jonathan Phillips 
Because ultimately, it's Intel-agent, and that's what the whole idea is. So I'll have a word with Cuan about that, because Cuan's, I think, the prime candidate for getting it wrong.

52:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can switch the I and the A if you wanted to sound like a lot of tech terms, like IntelliSense, Intelli-whatever. There's a lot of words for tech, which is Intelli-something, IntelliJ, IntelliSense.

53:16 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. Yeah. It's the AI in the middle, which is quite clever.

53:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
The pronunciation of intelligence is also like basically intelligent, but intelligent.

53:26 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well, that's the whole idea behind the brand. That was, that was my sort of purpose to try and have a clever word that just described the whole thing. And then I thought, Hey, it's got agent in as well. Isn't that clever? Oh, if I put an extra letter in, it has AI in as well. So it becomes lots of things, which is quite nice.

53:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

53:48 - Jonathan Phillips 
Cool. So if you, if you want, if you want to throw over any dates, times, whatever, then, then do so. And, um, we'll, we'll get on with it.

53:57 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, uh, what, yes. Around between what times are you free? Like nine to on a, on an average day.

54:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm a free, I'm free all the time, unless I'm not, that makes sense. So unless I've got something scheduled in my times are just anytime.

54:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'Ve got a schedule for 9 a.m. Someday.

54:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
Not Sunday morning.

54:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Someday.

54:27 - Jonathan Phillips 
That night is good for me most days. But obviously, you're the ones who we've got to sort of jig around because we're bright and breezy sort of first thing in the morning and you're getting tired. So I think it's best if you're not so tired and fired up Nine works, I think.

54:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, nine on Monday, maybe.

54:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
Right, let me have a look. This will be a nine on Monday that I can't do. Let's have a look.

55:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, or Tuesday. That also works.

55:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, nine on Monday for me. So this is the second, yeah?

55:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, I'm guessing you're correct.

55:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

55:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. How many people from your side would you be bringing?

55:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So J.P. Cuan.

55:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, say again.

55:33 - Jorge Lewis 
How many, how many people would be there? So you J.P. So you Cuan.

55:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
What would be the agenda? What would you want the agenda to be?

55:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
The agenda is figuring out the mission statement and the vision statement and getting everyone aligned with why the idea was conceptualized and where the end goal would be.

55:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
So are we talking across everything or one particular area?

56:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Across everything. We may run like mini versions of it for specific features that we want to get aligned on. But this is for the whole intelligence as a concept.

56:19 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm just thinking if Arif needs to be involved, but we could invite him to obviously participate because he's been a bit out of the loop. But I don't think it's necessary that he's there, but it'd be nice to have him there too.

56:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's always nice to have some people in the Mission Visions workshop, because then you get everyone's input. Sometimes you realize stuff for yourself and everything. We've been starting to run it internally for our own projects, and it's been wonderful.

56:45 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, OK. So let's try both of them. But again, they're the ones who have more formal meetings than I do, so we'll have to maybe work around that. But let's go for 9 o'clock on Monday morning. And if they have an issue, then we can maybe tweak it a little bit.

57:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could you send the meeting invite for just 9 a.m. On one of the days next week when everyone is free?

57:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, yeah. Let me sort that out.

57:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Just a little note, I have a project idea that I... Have you heard of... Actually, this is a good question for you. Have you heard of Essence Writing?

57:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
Essence Writing? Yeah.

57:27 - Jorge Lewis 
And it was just this writing exercise to be able to distill your thoughts. I have a project idea where it helps you learn how to articulate yourself better using a chatbot, ideally a voice interaction. So I'll let you know how that goes and if I can move forward with that in any regard and we can see if we can implement that into IA or adapt to that.

57:49 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, I like that. I like that because I do everything dictation wise everything I do is dictated unless obviously there's people in the room where I've got a type But I think that's the future. It really is the future that I mean, we know it's the future, but it really is the future It's good to be people who don't talk now are gonna be talking.

58:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you super whisper on your phone as well?

58:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
I do I've started to only recently, but I've used things for years as far as dictation, like Dragon Dictate and all the old school stuff. So I like the fact that the Apple sort of devices have a built-in dictation, but it's not great. That's the problem. It's easy to use. It's just not good. Yeah, so I'm trying to integrate and the problem I have is that it doesn't always it's the active window thing So with super whisper you end up saying it and it's not in the window and you're gonna paste it

58:44 - Jorge Lewis 
in I know it's not a big job, but it's like Every time is all like so Because I prefer dictation as well, but just it's inconvenient with iOS Hope the I the Apple AI when it comes out should be

58:59 - Jonathan Phillips 
including all of that stuff I'm looking forward to what is it the announcements on the 9th the new phone and then I think about the 20th They start to release the products don't they and then they operate the new

59:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Operating system will come in a week or so later Maybe yeah Yeah, I think the same date as the actually I'm not sure This year might be a little bit different considering. It's pretty big. Can't on my phone and I've got 13 so I can't use user I've got the only model right now that can use it the 15 pro or 15 pro and 15 pro max That's why I'm buying a

59:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
16 month But that's exciting for me the whole AI stuff on the phone is going to be hopefully It'll be a bit clunky to start with I imagine but once it gets going another app start to build into their whole frameworks It's gonna be so good Yeah.

59:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause if they're going to just improve it over time and I feel like at some point it'll be just, it's going to be super practical, practical.

1:00:03 - Jonathan Phillips 
It is. You're not going to have apps anymore. You just can have a device you talk to and it does it for you as just a box. And that's, that's really what we want.

1:00:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, remember mentioned like, uh, maybe we can just have a part of the experience in the beginning of the app, be just a little bit tutorial on how to use voice dictation, iPhone for the people that are trying it out on iPhone before we get the properly integrated.

1:00:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:00:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
There's a whole, there's a, there's a whole art and science behind it. It's not something that is pretty fundamentally straightforward talking to a device, but it's not.

1:00:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. When you're writing messages into your phone to talk with the workshop compared to when you're talking and it's dictating it into text, how you speak is way different. And of course, the AI will take how you're speaking as inspiration for how it's speaking. So it can quite change how the workshop feels.

1:01:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, yeah. I'm looking forward to having that element as well, because the whole idea is that it's like a human talking back to you. I know that's what AI is supposed to be, but it's not. If we can get it as near as possible, it then gives us a differentiation as well.

1:01:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah.

1:01:26 - Jonathan Phillips 
Cool. All right. Well, I'll go and try and sort some dates out, and we'll reconvene on that next week. Cool, cool.

1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Sounds good. Thanks.

Disabling echo.

0:08 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I mean like within Google Meets, maybe, I don't know.

0:12 - Jorge Lewis 
We had an issue one time with like the... Welcome back.

0:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Vivas is also going to join this meeting?

0:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

0:41 - Jorge Lewis 
It'll be funny if he doesn't join.

0:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Try speaking, Vivas.

0:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm speaking now. Yeah, there's an echo. There's an echo?

0:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I can speak from your mic.

0:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, okay. That works.

0:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, there's no issues.

1:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool. Cool.

1:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay. Uh, our viewers is joining. I think, I don't know. Why is your discord status idle by the way? Mine?

1:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
I do not know. Sometimes I do things which are very, you know, which I have to be embarrassed about later.

1:37 - Biwas bhandari 
Hello. Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you.

1:39 - Biwas bhandari 
Hello, Chinmay. Hello, Jorge.

1:41 - Biwas bhandari 
Hello, Jonas. Hello, Bhai. Do you remember India?

1:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yes, I remember.

2:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, so the plan is to pair you guys up I Don't know if I think I mentioned this maybe in our first call, but we like to try out pairing we I heard very good things from it from one of my Mentors, pretty much. So we're going to try it out. One of the top companies, engineering companies in the world, does this. So they always put one middle level and then one senior together. And they found that that works the best. So we're going to try that out. One key thing, though, is that we've got to make sure the communication is clear amongst different pairs. So if we have two pairs working on the same project, we have to make sure the two pairs are connected still.

2:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, yeah. So you guys want to introduce yourselves to each other?

2:43 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, we already have kind of

2:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, come on. Oh, bye. It doesn't introduce this whole conversation with side with those eyes.

2:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
I texted him.

2:57 - Biwas bhandari 
So we talk.

2:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, nice. Cool. Cool. Um, Yeah, so we were just going through what Chinmay went through. So we're going through that right now. I guess I could share my screen. We're on an Excalibur. Let me send the link.

3:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. That was just to kind of... Restated. So a couple of things that we want to make sure are clear, like for the next few days or just, um, number one, we need more updates, more, more check-ins throughout the day. Um, just to know where things are going, how things are going. Um, and then for schedule, let's try to get that sorted out. So what's your schedule looking like, Am I sharing my screen now?

3:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

3:54 - Biwas bhandari 
I'll be pretty much free every day.

3:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, I did not totally understand your school situation. So you started again already?

4:05 - Biwas bhandari 
The college started from this week's on days and I wasn't just casually not going and they called me. So I had to go from yesterday. Like I'll be going college from 6 a.m. To 9 a.m. In three hours.

4:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, every day on weekdays.

4:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, and then Okay so what time around the day do you think you'll be working, you'll be on the projects?

4:33 - Biwas bhandari 
During the day I'll be around from 4 11 to 2-3-4 around and at night I'll work 2-3 hours.

4:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay cool cool. Alright let's try to, I'll make a channel where we can just kind of Or after this, let's put the schedule in Google Sheets. I'll set it up, and we can all put the time that we're going to be planning to work so that we can kind of understand each other's schedules a little bit better.

5:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. So yeah, that's cool. Yeah, let's do it.

5:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So let me share my screen. We can go through this a little bit.

5:21 - Jorge Lewis 
What did you guys talk about when you guys had a conversation?

5:27 - Chinmay Pandya 
Actually, I asked him because I asked you about an error for build tools. So I asked if he faced the same error. That was the only conversation.

5:43 - Chinmay Pandya 
I asked him whether he faced the same error as me and know what he did, but his error was different. He also faced the error, but his error was different. My error was different.

5:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, although we have uh So there's a there's a client. Uh, this this group chat here that I'm on On my screen is uh for the clients So I'll invite you guys in a couple like after the four days are done and we can see how things are going I'll most likely invite you guys to this channel, but for now we can discuss all the stuff. Um in the dev channel here which you guys have access to yeah and that way like if you guys have an error maybe if jonas and I have had it as well we can also help so that's the nice thing about working with a lot of people okay so so we were just...

6:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
you have chat gpt plus three people?

6:38 - Jorge Lewis 
sorry? For your errors you have chat gpt plus three people All right, so, okay, so where was I going? Okay, so for my graph, it looks like this a little bit.

7:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Why is this thing so big?

7:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have the supervisor. A supervisor would decide, or it goes to the router to decide.

7:17 - Jorge Lewis 
It decides who goes next, whether the code, this would be. Actually, the supervisor calls a tool that updates the database, so there's no collector. The supervisor was going to manage all of it.

7:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So within this tool, there is fetch check-in.

7:45 - Jorge Lewis 
There's fetch check-in.

7:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Update check-in. What else was there? Oh yeah, just terminate.

7:56 - Jorge Lewis 
This was from before. This is from like the Python, I believe. And so all messages get passed through the supervisor. So if the supervisor, if the user provides data, the supervisor will call update check-in.

8:11 - Jorge Lewis 
And the supervisor in his prompt was told, if after you've updated the check-in, see if the coach would speak and we'd just give it a couple of reasons like when the coach would speak. And then the coach was connected to a... A...

8:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Data analyst, is it? Yeah.

8:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Damn. That's a mad baby.

8:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Someone has died. So the coach would be able to call on the analyst. I think it would be kind of default, so always, yeah, let's fix this a little bit. So this would always be the case. The coach will always ask the data analyst, hey, are there special insights that I should know about? Whoever has that mic in POC, I'm reading.

9:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So the supervisor would determine usually to call a tool or to call to pass it on to the coach and the problem with this though is that the coach would usually only give one message and then it depends on what's happening next. So this part, this system was missing kind of really this line. So I think, yeah, so probably the supervisor would need to be told, hey, if, or some condition to make it so that the coach can have a conversation with the user, a back and forth.

10:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Where's the data collector here?

10:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I remember, the data collector is the supervisor.

10:19 - Jorge Lewis 
The problem is just the user can't have a conversation with the coach. You'll have a conversation with the supervisor, which depending on how we determine the roles could work, but...

10:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you name the supervisor collector?

10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Who will the analyst respond to?

10:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
The coach.

10:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
So can't we put the analyst before and then pass the data from analyst to the coach?

10:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I see what you mean. Yeah, okay. But then the reason I made it like this is because we need to solve the problem that the coach should have a conversation with the user. If there's a data analyst in the middle, that shouldn't work.

11:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Data analyst will only use- We can have two edges, like we can have an edge with the coach also and an edge with the analyst also.

11:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you show me?

11:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, just move the analyst a little bit up.

11:21 - Jorge Lewis 
I think you can show me as well, like this.

11:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
Oh, I haven't.

11:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

11:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait.

11:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah.

11:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Like here?

11:53 - Jorge Lewis 
yeah so this can be this and this can be this so if the collector got data from the user Yeah. How about we pass it to the analyst and then he passes on the analysis to the coach?

12:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe instead… Okay, let me… Oh, is there another graph I'm missing? No, okay.

12:47 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I'm creating one below to demonstrate another. And also, someone killed the analyst and didn't bring him back.

12:59 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so what I'm thinking is.

13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, I'll also create a graph Somebody killed the user you Maybe my mic is better, but then you'll have the echo, which I'm trying to deal with.

14:13 - Jorge Lewis 
So hard to speak.

14:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Error.

14:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I got an error.

14:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So for my graph, can we all take a look at mine for a second?

14:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah, just refresh.

15:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you guys are busy making yours.

15:02 - Jorge Lewis 
I think just let everyone finish first, and then we'll go for all of them.

15:32 - Jorge Lewis 
You may want to mute.

15:45 - Jorge Lewis 
you.

17:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Since it's not a node, it's just the edges, I can label the edges rather. Would that work?

17:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

17:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool.

20:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'll be back in a sec.

21:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, I should be done with mine, so let me know when you guys are done.

22:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, text width 80 bro.

22:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So yours isn't the graph. It's just a different diagram.

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's a depiction. It's a flowchart. So out of that flowchart, hopefully one of the graphs that you guys make complies and can fulfill it.

22:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
You know how hard it is to talk while listening to yourself?

22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

23:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, your one is good. I think my one... Let's wait for Chinmay to get back. All right, Genesis, do you want to take a look at mine for now?

23:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

24:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh no.

24:10 - Jorge Lewis 
What's a good song about that guy's gonna be?

24:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Chinmay abandoned us, man.

25:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh.

25:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Nevermind.

25:10 - Jorge Lewis 
What happened?

25:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Welcome back. I'm done with my graph. Jonas is done with his diagram. I don't know about you.

25:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'll just make some changes and then let you know.

25:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Cool, cool.

25:28 - Biwas bhandari 
But I'll send you a photo, I've done it in my copy. It's a little faster.

30:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
B1, or how do you pronounce it? Biwas?

30:10 - Biwas bhandari 
You're muted.

30:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
What did you say?

30:15 - Biwas bhandari 
How do you pronounce your name?

30:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Biwas.

30:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
B-I-W-A-S. Biwas?

30:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

30:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Are you in the Excalibur?

30:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Where?

30:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
In the Excalibur.

30:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, not right now.

30:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could you send it to him, Jorge? Yeah, send it to him. Yeah, new lang chain devs. Where? Wait, no. Where is it? Oh, it's in the Google Meet chat. OK.

30:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, if you could join it, and just zoom out and go a bit down right, and you should find a bunch of graphs for modeling.

31:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Can you show me where it is? I cannot find it.

31:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
OK.

31:46 - Jorge Lewis 
I've seen the link in the Google Meets. Like, I'll try. Can you not see it?

32:01 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I followed the link and I'm only seeing two graphs here.

32:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, scroll down.

32:07 - Jorge Lewis 
First, two neural networks will be created.

32:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Jinro was trying to flex, so he sent us that one.

32:24 - Jorge Lewis 
You actually pronounced my name right.

33:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So usually I don't have any trouble, but I don't know if it's I think it's the microphone maybe Yeah, my name is a bit unique so Typical indian names you might know like raj Yeah, alexa, vanid all that ass Malhar, Fancy.

33:35 - Jorge Lewis 
But, Bablu, you're from Nepal, right? So how do you guys speak the same, both Hindi?

33:42 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I watch a lot more Hindi movies, so...

33:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah, okay, okay.

33:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Both Nepal and India are Hindi speaking countries.

34:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks to my fans, I learned also nice words.

34:09 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I know which words you know.

34:16 - Jorge Lewis 
The only word that I know that isn't like a bad word Yeah, it's like an exclamation like bro Yeah All right, let me know when you guys are done I oh I'm useful very nice making oh Okay, I don't want to stretch out this meeting too long because just because when people are in meetings too long, they start to get tired really easily. And when you get tired, you communicate terribly. So we can either take a break now and come back in like 10 minutes.

34:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And then continue for like 30 minutes. I don't want to I don't want to stay on call too long, just throughout the whole day. So how about that? You guys can finish your graphs, work on them if they need working. We can come back in 10 minutes, take a look at all the graphs, and kind of merge them into one idea. And then from there, we can discuss the plan moving forward. Sound good?

35:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. All right.

35:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Perfecto, guys. I'll see you guys soon.

35:23 - Jorge Lewis 
They have a concert outside, I don't know. We're at the office. I don't mind. It's just annoying by calls. Alright, I'll see you guys soon.

35:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
See you guys soon.

35:36 - Jorge Lewis 
You're closing the meeting or it's still on?

35:40 - Jorge Lewis 
It says it's ending in 25 minutes. I mean, I could keep it open. We'll see.

35:45 - Jorge Lewis 
If we're taking a 10-minute break, can you just close it and then send a message or send a new meeting?

35:50 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, we'll see.

35:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Pleasant.

6:38 - Jorge Lewis 
sorry? For your errors you have chat gpt plus three people All right, so, okay, so where was I going? Okay, so for my graph, it looks like this a little bit.

7:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Why is this thing so big?

7:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have the supervisor. A supervisor would decide, or it goes to the router to decide.

7:17 - Jorge Lewis 
It decides who goes next, whether the code, this would be. Actually, the supervisor calls a tool that updates the database, so there's no collector. The supervisor was going to manage all of it.

7:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So within this tool, there is fetch check-in.

7:45 - Jorge Lewis 
There's fetch check-in.

7:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Update check-in. What else was there? Oh yeah, just terminate.

7:56 - Jorge Lewis 
This was from before. This is from like the Python, I believe. And so all messages get passed through the supervisor. So if the supervisor, if the user provides data, the supervisor will call update check-in.

8:11 - Jorge Lewis 
And the supervisor in his prompt was told, if after you've updated the check-in, see if the coach would speak and we'd just give it a couple of reasons like when the coach would speak. And then the coach was connected to a... A...

8:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Data analyst, is it? Yeah.

8:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Damn. That's a mad baby.

8:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Someone has died. So the coach would be able to call on the analyst. I think it would be kind of default, so always, yeah, let's fix this a little bit. So this would always be the case. The coach will always ask the data analyst, hey, are there special insights that I should know about? Whoever has that mic in POC, I'm reading.

9:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So the supervisor would determine usually to call a tool or to call to pass it on to the coach and the problem with this though is that the coach would usually only give one message and then it depends on what's happening next. So this part, this system was missing kind of really this line. So I think, yeah, so probably the supervisor would need to be told, hey, if, or some condition to make it so that the coach can have a conversation with the user, a back and forth.

10:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Where's the data collector here?

10:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I remember, the data collector is the supervisor.

10:19 - Jorge Lewis 
The problem is just the user can't have a conversation with the coach. You'll have a conversation with the supervisor, which depending on how we determine the roles could work, but...

10:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you name the supervisor collector?

10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Who will the analyst respond to?

10:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
The coach.

10:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
So can't we put the analyst before and then pass the data from analyst to the coach?

10:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I see what you mean. Yeah, okay. But then the reason I made it like this is because we need to solve the problem that the coach should have a conversation with the user. If there's a data analyst in the middle, that shouldn't work.

11:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Data analyst will only use- We can have two edges, like we can have an edge with the coach also and an edge with the analyst also.

11:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you show me?

11:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, just move the analyst a little bit up.

11:21 - Jorge Lewis 
I think you can show me as well, like this.

11:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
Oh, I haven't.

11:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

11:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait.

11:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah.

11:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Like here?

11:53 - Jorge Lewis 
yeah so this can be this and this can be this so if the collector got data from the user Yeah. How about we pass it to the analyst and then he passes on the analysis to the coach?

12:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe instead… Okay, let me… Oh, is there another graph I'm missing? No, okay.

12:47 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I'm creating one below to demonstrate another. And also, someone killed the analyst and didn't bring him back.

12:59 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so what I'm thinking is.

13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, I'll also create a graph Somebody killed the user you Maybe my mic is better, but then you'll have the echo, which I'm trying to deal with.

14:13 - Jorge Lewis 
So hard to speak.

14:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Error.

14:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I got an error.

14:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So for my graph, can we all take a look at mine for a second?

14:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah, just refresh.

15:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you guys are busy making yours.

15:02 - Jorge Lewis 
I think just let everyone finish first, and then we'll go for all of them.

15:32 - Jorge Lewis 
You may want to mute.

15:45 - Jorge Lewis 
you.

17:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Since it's not a node, it's just the edges, I can label the edges rather. Would that work?

17:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

17:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool.

20:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'll be back in a sec.

21:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, I should be done with mine, so let me know when you guys are done.

22:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, text width 80 bro.

22:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So yours isn't the graph. It's just a different diagram.

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's a depiction. It's a flowchart. So out of that flowchart, hopefully one of the graphs that you guys make complies and can fulfill it.

22:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
You know how hard it is to talk while listening to yourself?

22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

23:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, your one is good. I think my one... Let's wait for Chinmay to get back. All right, Genesis, do you want to take a look at mine for now?

23:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

24:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh no.

24:10 - Jorge Lewis 
What's a good song about that guy's gonna be?

24:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Chinmay abandoned us, man.

25:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh.

25:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Nevermind.

25:10 - Jorge Lewis 
What happened?

25:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Welcome back. I'm done with my graph. Jonas is done with his diagram. I don't know about you.

25:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'll just make some changes and then let you know.

25:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Cool, cool.

25:28 - Biwas bhandari 
But I'll send you a photo, I've done it in my copy. It's a little faster.

30:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
B1, or how do you pronounce it? Biwas?

30:10 - Biwas bhandari 
You're muted.

30:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
What did you say?

30:15 - Biwas bhandari 
How do you pronounce your name?

30:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Biwas.

30:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
B-I-W-A-S. Biwas?

30:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

30:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Are you in the Excalibur?

30:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Where?

30:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
In the Excalibur.

30:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, not right now.

30:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could you send it to him, Jorge? Yeah, send it to him. Yeah, new lang chain devs. Where? Wait, no. Where is it? Oh, it's in the Google Meet chat. OK.

30:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, if you could join it, and just zoom out and go a bit down right, and you should find a bunch of graphs for modeling.

31:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Can you show me where it is? I cannot find it.

31:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
OK.

31:46 - Jorge Lewis 
I've seen the link in the Google Meets. Like, I'll try. Can you not see it?

32:01 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I followed the link and I'm only seeing two graphs here.

32:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, scroll down.

32:07 - Jorge Lewis 
First, two neural networks will be created.

32:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Jinro was trying to flex, so he sent us that one.

32:24 - Jorge Lewis 
You actually pronounced my name right.

33:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So usually I don't have any trouble, but I don't know if it's I think it's the microphone maybe Yeah, my name is a bit unique so Typical indian names you might know like raj Yeah, alexa, vanid all that ass Malhar, Fancy.

33:35 - Jorge Lewis 
But, Bablu, you're from Nepal, right? So how do you guys speak the same, both Hindi?

33:42 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I watch a lot more Hindi movies, so...

33:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah, okay, okay.

33:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Both Nepal and India are Hindi speaking countries.

34:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks to my fans, I learned also nice words.

34:09 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I know which words you know.

34:16 - Jorge Lewis 
The only word that I know that isn't like a bad word Yeah, it's like an exclamation like bro Yeah All right, let me know when you guys are done I oh I'm useful very nice making oh Okay, I don't want to stretch out this meeting too long because just because when people are in meetings too long, they start to get tired really easily. And when you get tired, you communicate terribly. So we can either take a break now and come back in like 10 minutes.

34:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And then continue for like 30 minutes. I don't want to I don't want to stay on call too long, just throughout the whole day. So how about that? You guys can finish your graphs, work on them if they need working. We can come back in 10 minutes, take a look at all the graphs, and kind of merge them into one idea. And then from there, we can discuss the plan moving forward. Sound good?

35:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. All right.

35:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Perfecto, guys. I'll see you guys soon.

35:23 - Jorge Lewis 
They have a concert outside, I don't know. We're at the office. I don't mind. It's just annoying by calls. Alright, I'll see you guys soon.

35:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
See you guys soon.

35:36 - Jorge Lewis 
You're closing the meeting or it's still on?

35:40 - Jorge Lewis 
It says it's ending in 25 minutes. I mean, I could keep it open. We'll see.

35:45 - Jorge Lewis 
If we're taking a 10-minute break, can you just close it and then send a message or send a new meeting?

35:50 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, we'll see.

35:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Pleasant.

2:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

2:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so this is what I came up with instead of this thing routing and all against us.

3:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
You are muted.

3:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Can you hear me?

3:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, George Fry speaking.

3:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Test, test, test.

3:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I can hear an echo. I mean, yes.

4:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
You can mute me, I think. Excellent.

4:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, can I?

4:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, but then everyone else is hearing an echo as well. No.

4:16 - Unidentified Speaker 
They weren't when I was.

4:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Now?

4:23 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Oh, mute.

4:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I muted you.

4:25 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Oh, the mute is for everyone, though.

4:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
So we can't.

4:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can't you mute individuals?

4:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Doesn't seem like it.

4:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, now you know how I had us.

4:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
This mic is way better, though, I think. The camera one?

4:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah, surprisingly, it's quite good.

4:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you hear, like, the music outside? Can you hear me?

4:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, I guess.

4:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but it's not clear.

5:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah, when you're leaning back. I mean, it was the same thing for when I was speaking, I think. No, you weren't quite good.

5:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, I could hear myself.

5:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
It was meh.

5:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
We're dead.

5:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Where is me?

5:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Speak of the legend.

5:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Alright, welcome back. Jonas and I got ourselves some beers.

5:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
It was free.

5:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
From the festival right outside, yeah. The concert outside.

5:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
The concert, yeah. The karaoke, actually.

5:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, were they?

5:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Where? We're in a co-working space.

5:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's 8 p.m.

5:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
at the moment. Wait, is he saying how old?

6:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, like, what's your age? How old are you? Would you like to guess?

6:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
25. 25 who?

6:12 - Biwas bhandari 
For both, around 24.

6:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

6:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
And Maddy was?

6:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
What's your guess? How old are you?

6:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I saw a YouTube video of Jorge. He was saying he was 18 years old.

6:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. Yeah.

6:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jorge. Well, I am 20.

6:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, ISO is one of the video software engineer or something in YouTube.

6:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
YouTube?

6:41 - Biwas bhandari 
What?

6:42 - Biwas bhandari 
There is one video that you saw, yeah. Is that a video?

6:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, there's a video of Jorge in YouTube? Is it VTube?

6:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, where did I find it?

6:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, Jonas is 20.

6:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
I'm 20. Jorge? 18.

7:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
You're 18? Yes, sir.

7:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:06 - Chinmay Pandya 
You're younger than me. Yes.

7:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we've been in the game a while. We've been trying to start, like, companies and stuff for, like, ever since. How old are you?

7:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
14, so. Yeah.

7:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, yeah, we've gotten a lot of experience, yeah, through that.

7:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
I thought you guys were like really seniors.

7:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
We have the experience of seniors, really. Because you mentioned you had six years of experience, I thought. Yeah, I mean, I started when I was 12, so.

7:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I started ninth grade, like, coding, and then me and Jorge were, like, doing game development and more younger people projects than what we are currently, and now we're trying to make money. With our experience, that's from when I was 18, I got a job as a software engineering in a Norwegian consultancy, worked on bank applications, and also, what was it? Some internal software used by the oil and gas industry in Norway.

8:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
It seems to be getting loud outside.

8:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

8:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
That's impressive, I can say. At the age of 12, I started watching anime.

8:43 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because you cannot have the freedom to do anything unless you pass out from your college.

8:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yup.

8:53 - Biwas bhandari 
But I didn't get my mobile until I was 18. Now we can change that.

8:58 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
If things go well between us, we'll be able to give you a really good thing to do. If you want to move past our company, then you'll be able to find a job pretty easily, hopefully.

9:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
Vivaaz bhai, how old are you? I'm going to be 21 this year.

9:13 - Biwas bhandari 
You're the oldest. What are they discussing, Jorge?

9:16 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
It's your end-to-end knowledge.

9:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hindi knowledge.

9:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
He's looks 21, the youngest and he's the oldest.

9:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
So how old are you guys? I'm 20.

9:41 - Biwas bhandari 
I'll be 21 December.

9:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nice, nice.

9:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

9:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let's not confuse the fact that I'm younger than you guys and anything else.

9:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Anyways, yeah, let's get back to it.

9:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, let's get back to diagramming.

10:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll share my screen just so we can be on one thing.

10:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, actually, before we go into the graphs...

10:20 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So before we go into the graphs, I want to...

10:26 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So before we go into the graphs since that's more flexible I kind of want to talk about the current state of the project and what's the plan so currently we have We were in the middle of migrating, you guys probably know this part already, we were migrating from Python to TypeScript, we were in the middle, we set everything, we set the foundations up, we connected to the database, connected it to the front end with just a simple one function, and we were in the process of making it actually work with LandGraph. Currently, right now, the biggest problem we're facing, other than just setting up the actual graph, is passing the message history to the chat. So I think I'm sharing my screen. So when we're calling a stream and we initialize it with this list of messages, the problem is that it's not somehow getting all the messages. So that's the current bug we're facing.

11:27 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Maybe you guys have experience with this. I don't know. I want to say that in my testing, I noticed that passing messages worked.

11:35 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
But if I created messages manually, So when this was just like a list of messages it works Okay, like it multiple Yeah, I think maybe just better use a normal list like like before That didn't work either. I think it's the parsing from the database to messages that doesn't work. But that's what I was testing before we got in this meeting. I think I was at the edge of maybe solving it, I don't know.

12:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, so we'll take a look at that later. But that's where we're currently at. And in terms of where we need to be, where we need to be is by Wednesday, end of day Wednesday, we need to have the the project deployed and the client can test it, Kuin. Kuin is his name, I'm gonna use his name, so that Kuin can test it. The capabilities you need to be able to do is to just have a conversation with the bot, so making it so that it can have a conversation like we discussed, like the example I sent and like the one we had today. So, yeah.

13:02 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So in terms of what the plan is, who's going to do what, we can go over it maybe now? So since you two are going to be paired together, it'll be kind of up to you guys to decide if we have maybe two prototypes we want to test, you guys can go into each one and test those out, or however you guys want to do it, that's up to you guys.

13:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Jonas, do you want to tackle the message bug, or do you want to hand it? Do you want to see if they can take it on?

13:38 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I want to tackle it for at least this day. But if I don't solve it today, I will probably have to go.

13:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

13:47 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So today, Jonas will work on that little bug that I mentioned. If he's not able to do it, then we'll pass it to you guys, since you guys are probably more experienced with LandGraph.

13:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, cool.

13:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so yes, let's get it to the graph. Who would like to go first? So actually, I think Jonas should go first, since his one, our ones are, what the

14:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
I can't zoom out.

14:13 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Oh, that's the max. I guess we'll go through Jonas's graph first, since his one is just the conversation, not the actual line graph. So yeah, Jonas, you go ahead, I'll mute.

14:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, this diagram is more to specify what it should be capable of It doesn't really go into the technicals of how things should be pushed to the DB and how things should be retrieved properly, because I think that's more of a technical issue that can be solved no matter how the conversation goes out. But this is basically the parts of the conversation where someone will be sending a message that will be visible to the user.

14:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have top left here. It's the user starting the check-in. When the user starts the check-in, it'll always go to the collector first. And the collector will then request something from the user. For example, how far have you walked today? Then afterwards, hopefully the user gives their request of information. If they reject, or if they say, I don't know, or something like that, it'll probably go back to the collector again for the collector to be like, OK, can you estimate? Or OK, something like that.

15:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
And also, let's say the user gives a complicated answer. Maybe the user says, I walked around my block. Then the collector's job is to say, okay, well, how far was that? And maybe kind of tease and say, the average block is maybe 1KM. Would you say that's accurate? So that's his job. Yeah. Okay.

15:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just extract the information from the user.

16:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
More point, yeah. When the information is extracted from the user, And the user, for the first time in this loop, goes to the coach. It always goes through the analyst, which analyzes the data, as well as pointing out if any previous data is relevant. So the analyst's job can be to detect long-term patterns and more complicated stuff than just the coach acting on the data now. And the analyst will pass that to the coach. So, of course, then the coach is on the info, and afterwards it goes back to the user. Now, during the check-in, as I've written here, after the coach has spoken, we need to determine if it should go back to the collector to go on to the next item. Basically, if the user just says, OK, sure, that's fine, then it will go back to the collector, and the collector will ask for more information. Or if the user says something like, why should I do that? I don't understand. I think I'm doing an OK pace now. I don't want to increase it. If it says something like that, Then it should go to the coach again so that the coach can comment on what the user said without it going to the collector and the collector requesting information for it, because that's not always going to fit in. Sometimes it needs to be like a back and forth. Why would I do that? Because it's good for you. Why is it good for me? Because it is. And then finally, when they agree, the discussion with the coach, it goes back to the collector again to move on to the next item. At which point, the loop restarts with the user giving the information. Or if they don't, it goes back to the collector, tries to get the information. Afterwards, the analyst analyzes it, points out things for the coach to coach on. And then onto the coach, the loop continues until the coaching is completely done.

17:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Any questions?

18:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nah, I got it.

18:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nah, seems pretty straight forward.

18:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yep, sounds good.

18:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Thank you.

18:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can we take it to the next Skylar?

18:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
That sounds more logical than mine.

18:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, so what's what?

18:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are these old now?

18:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, how about we move that somewhere else. So, who's this one that I'm on?

18:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
What I was thinking was also similar to Jonas, but he drew a better graph than me with all the nodes. What I was thinking was the same, is that the user can have two edges, but whenever the user checks in, it will always go to the check-in node. And this this will call the previous data from the data and then it will pass to the analyst and it will always go from the analyst to the coach whenever it goes from the check-in node so the analyst analyzes the past data and this is The analyst will analyze the past data and the today's data from the check-in and it will pass on to the coach and then the coach can decide to give advice and once it has given advice, the user can also obviously like Yona said, user can counter and coach can give follow-ups or he can counter back and when the user feels satisfied he can end and if he asks another question it will go again back to a check-in and so yeah was I able to make it clear or coach is coached on it, and it's done.

20:28 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
How do we depict in this graph that we're going to the next item? Because we need to have it so that the check, I mean, the coach can also be responsible. But I think it would be more reasonable if the check-in node is responsible for making sure the, or asking for more data.

20:49 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that's an additional thing which you almost mentioned. His graph is more logical. At the time of check-in, if we ask more data, so we'll have more user input on what he did.

21:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
So...

21:08 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Would it make more sense if we did...

21:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Sorry for messing up your graph here, but...

21:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hold Alt to...

21:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, there we go.

21:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So instead this is, um, so would this, would this still kind of make sense for your, for your idea?

21:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:50 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And then, and then it's the supervisor's job to determine is the user passing new data that the check-in node should handle, or is the user responding to a coach's message?

22:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

22:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
So if the user is countering the coach, then the supervisor knows that I have to call the coach next, but if the user is passing on new data or the user is setting new goals, then it will pass into the check-in.

22:23 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And then this line here, I don't know if you can see this one. Is this still relevant?

22:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because we added the supervisor, this is not relevant. Yeah.

22:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So then, so when the check-in node gets new data, and he updates the database, he'll tell the analyst, the analyst will tell the coach, and then the coach will, okay, cool, nice. Okay, makes sense.

22:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
And any other questions, guys?

22:49 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
One, is the check-in node basically the interaction between the user and the collector, or the collector tries to get information out of the user?

22:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
I can't hear you. Oh.

23:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is the check-in node basically the collector and the user working together to get the data out of the user? So, yeah. Yeah.

23:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

23:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. The check-in is the collector. I just wrote a check-in because I wanted for it to be clear to me that whenever the user enters new data, it will go to the check-in.

23:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

23:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sounds good.

23:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right.

23:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Um, he was, yeah.

23:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay.

23:56 - Biwas bhandari 
so basically a user will input something and this chat prompt will decide either it should go to collector or not we can give it logic like if the user checks in then call this function otherwise just chat with the coach and if it chats with the coach it will update in the collector and then it will again return to the user And it's basically similar users added their supervisor instead of that prompt.

24:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, it looks, I think it's identical to, it's a little bit different, but I noticed a mistake on Xinmei's one that I forgot to do was that the coach should actually be returning to the user. Same for the collector. No point going back to the supervisor.

24:55 - Biwas bhandari 
Instead of supervisor, we can just train, give a logic to the chat prompt. It will be easier.

25:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, and then the key feature, the key difference I see is that the coach is connected to the data analyst.

25:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep. Do you wanna go through that?

25:15 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so in the, yes, when a user will just check in, it will pass it to the collector. And the collector again pass it to the coach and it will pass it, not coach. The collector will pass it to the data analyst.

25:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
So this makes more sense.

25:42 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
The arrows, you guys, your graphs are so big that I can't see the arrows.

25:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Well, yep.

25:51 - Biwas bhandari 
The user will input something and this chat prompt will determine either is the user just checked in or just wants to chat with the coach. And if it wants to check in, it will pass it to the collector and the collector will pass it to the data analyst and the coach and coach will return it to the user.

26:11 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. It's good.

26:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

26:12 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I think that's good.

26:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
Edge from coach to collector.

26:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

26:34 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I was about to ask that.

26:45 - Biwas bhandari 
Did I make it clear or is there any questions? This one.

26:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
What does the edge between coach and collector represent? Or when does it get triggered?

26:57 - Biwas bhandari 
When the user will ask, like you said, why should I do it? How should I do it? And it will update to the collector. No, no. Coach to collector, bro.

27:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Huh?

27:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
Coach to collector.

27:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Coach to collector?

27:12 - Biwas bhandari 
Why would it go to coach to collector?

27:14 - Chinmay Pandya 
You don't have to put it in the database.

27:19 - Biwas bhandari 
I think the conversation between user and coach should also be stored. That's why.

27:27 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So, so this, so this one is to, okay.

27:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

27:35 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but we, I think we can remove the chat prompt nodes and basically just connect coach and collector directly to the user. And that will be basically why you, yeah.

27:57 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Like that. And keep the user one? Like the user to collector, that arrow?

28:08 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, that's when the user is starting to check in, it'll go to the collector. Same in my graph, like when the user is starting to check.

28:17 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, conditionals are dotted. OK. So, I mean, just for in terms of the actual line graph, there needs to be a supervisor node to determine who to go to. The user can't, so let me just add that.

28:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Well, okay, so.

28:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
The collector has to be able to speak with the user to get back and forth.

28:56 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so it's funny we've we've gone we've I think this is now the actual exact same as yeah, it's the exact same as she lies away No It's the, uh, no, no, the graph is, uh, wait, what is one coach to, okay. Instead of, so there's one.

29:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

29:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
In his graph, it's like it will move to coach and the coach will request analysis from the analyst in mind at the time of checking, it will move always to the analyst then to the coach.

29:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
I see. Yeah, yeah.

29:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, cool. Let's go through my one and then we can kind of come to a conclusion.

29:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
So you can decide routing without a supervisor.

30:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, but I, yeah, it's a bit of a design choice. It's like, do you want to delegate the task to a language model to determine from the conversation or do we want to trust the other agents to put a text in their answer?

30:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so if we do not want to use a supervisor agent node, then we can use the router logic, which sits between the edges. Sorry, say it again.

30:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
For questions where it's like, do we want to delegate this test to a model or to something like that, I think diagram both of them, just so we have both diagrams. And then in the future, we can try both and see which works best.

30:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah.

30:58 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
When it's things that we don't know for sure, we're better off trying than trying to be like, hmm. I mean, I guess sometimes you can think it through, though.

31:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:05 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I think just trying is the most reliable way to get it. And sometimes you think things through, and then you leave. Yeah. Yeah.

31:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Cool.

31:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so I'll go through my one. Did you guys hear all that by the way?

31:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

31:28 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. Did you guys hear the, what Jonas was saying?

31:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, we couldn't hear what he said. Not quite clearly.

31:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:37 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Um, he said that's when we have things like that, we don't know for sure. It's better to just try them out in the code and see which one actually performs better. Because sometimes through discussion, it's not enough to actually get a real world understanding of it.

31:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
If it works or not, unless we. Language models are so unpredictable.

31:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And then also when you're trying to code it in that process, you understand like new under the table, like problems and stuff. Yeah. Um, okay. So I'll go through mine and then we can kind of conclude. So. Let me try to remember, what's the, why I have two?

32:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

32:25 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, the bottom one is better. The bottom one's better. I'll explain the top one after, but just the bottom one's better. So first of all, we start with user, and the concept of this is where the collector will receive every message first, And if the message is related to the collector's task, so for example, if the user is passing the message, or if the user says, let's check in, or if the user says, dude, I'm done with my check in, you're so boring, let's stop the check in any of those things, the collector will call his tools and complete those actions. But if the user is not invoking is not like trying to invoke one of those tools, the collector without responding or without doing any actions, Or maybe he will do some actions. We'll pass it to the coach, and the coach will make a response. So for example, if the user says, let's check in, the collector will call his tool that says start check-in, and he'll pass it to coach. Or the collector will respond and gather the data. As soon as the data is collected, it'll go to coach. The coach will provide some feedback. If the user is responding to that feedback, it'll go to the collector first. The collector will see, will tell it, or will teach it how to understand when it's responding to the coach, and it'll hand it off to the coach directly. So it's kind of being in the middle of a supervisor, but also just telling it, hey, if this is applicable to you, do something. If it's not, just hand it off to the coach, which is always a direct line. So it'll always pass it to the coach. Although this is not the case, actually. Sometimes when the user says, let's check in, the collector should say, OK, he should prompt the user to ask or give information. There's no one else in.

34:11 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
My speaker's not loud enough.

34:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
It isn't.

34:16 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Mine is. Mine isn't.

34:18 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I can show you. You can just get the Chrome extension. My speakers like start buzzing.

34:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is yours not?

34:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
No. So for the collector, if the collector calls new or update check-in, so as in the user gives new data, he'll pass it to the analyst and the analyst will then go to the coach. But if it's something like, if he's starting a check-in or if he's ending a check-in, it'll most likely go to the coach.

34:55 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Does that make sense or can I have some questions?

35:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so who will ask the follow-ups?

35:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

35:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Who will ask the follow-ups or if let's say the user has checked in, so the collector has either two choices, either go to the coach, not call any tools, or either call his tools to get previous data. But what if you want to have a conversation between collector and user to get more data before it passes to the coach?

35:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, so then if the data has not, so usually this edge will only be triggered when updates check, when update check-in is called, usually. I think there's probably some more nuanced cases.

35:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So for example, the user says, I walked around the block, my house's block, and the collector will see that and say, okay, that's not enough information for me to update the database. So let me go back to the user and ask for more information or try to pry it out. Otherwise, if we know we have the information we need, then we're going to pass it to the coach. Not the analyst. Or then the analyst first and then the coach. But when would this line ever go? This line would go when it's not new data. So if it's, if the user is responding to a coach, so like, let's say the coach says you should walk five, five KM instead of one, by the way, I don't know why we're using miles. So everyone, like literally everyone in the, in this entire project uses KM. So you guys use KM, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Even the client uses it.

36:38 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Wouldn't that go use for coach then? Why pass it to collector just for the collector to go? I don't need to do anything to this.

36:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
No, because then otherwise we'd need a router every single time and it would be actually cost more than a collector itself.

36:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

36:52 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
So it's basically if we want to leave it like the responsibility to the collector. Yeah.

36:56 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So it's just saying collector may or may not do anything, but making a route to collector by default solves the problem of introducing an extra supervisor.

37:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Could you add the comment on that line instead of just update check-in, just no new relevant info, or just the coach is having a conversation, the collector does nothing.

37:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, just default, I think.

37:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
The collector does nothing. Yeah, collector does nothing.

37:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
So whenever the user enters a prompt or check-in, and if the data is not enough, then will the collector add that to the database first or ask more questions?

37:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry, just repeat that.

37:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
If the user enters something which is not enough, not enough to analyze, like you said, he walked, he just walked around and if the collector wants to know more data before he passes to the analyzer, then will he update the database, the pieces of information he gets when he gets those pieces, or will he update the information once he gets enough pieces?

38:04 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
He, he has to do it when he gets enough pieces because in the data, this is a, oh, this is the wrong project.

38:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah.

38:13 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Um, so, so in the database, there's columns specifically for the items. So things like, um, the NKM, how far has the user walked? So if the user has given anything other than that, the collector needs the number of kilometers the user has walked. Um, so if the user says I walked around.

38:34 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I walked around a football pitch three times. The collector could interpret this and say, okay, so, or if the user says something like that, then the collector, if he's very certain that the distance of a football pitch, then he can do it.

38:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

38:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
So if you add a node in between, which has the function to decide whether the information is enough or not. And then when the information is enough, then it will pass to the collector. So the collector won't have to decide additional logic to maintain whether the information is enough or not. Collector can just have two functions, whether call from the database or pass it to the coach.

39:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
Right now, collector has three logics. Call from the database, pass it to the coach, or check whether data is enough or not. So if the data is not enough, we can add another node which decides if the data is enough or not before passing it to the collector.

39:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, I see. I think both will work. Your one is kind of more robust. I'm trying to think of any downsides of introducing an extra node in the middle here.

40:09 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I haven't heard any of the context, but I don't think we should avoid introducing nodes.

40:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
There is actually a problem, though, with speed, with time. Because once we introduce too many nodes, the duration for a response becomes actually unbearable.

40:26 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
We can improve that with faster models, of course, but we're trying to keep, like, ideally, it's just not going through a lot of nodes.

40:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
What about, like, limited loop structures, like the one I created, where it's, like, they take part in one part of the loop, then jump to another part of the loop, then jump? Like, if we straight up implemented my whole flowchart as a graph, how would that work?

40:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Because usually then it's only going for like two months at a time.

40:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So in my experience, what I made with the Python graph, actually, the collector was doing what I... My graph here is actually what was the case before, except the analysis is a little bit different. The collector in my previous one was doing the three logics. So understanding if we have enough info, passing it to the coach or updating the database.

41:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And it was able to do it quite accurately as well. It was like, for example, if I said I walked to cam and then another message later on, I said, Oh, actually I walked an additional eight, then it was able to update it accordingly. Um, I didn't do rigorous testing. So, so maybe, but I think to start off, we can start with this. And then if we know if in our testing, we figure out, okay, this, this guy's pretty inaccurate when we try to like, test its limits in terms of like making more complicated answers, then we can introduce one. Does that work or do you think otherwise?

41:47 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I think we should try with a simpler model first.

41:53 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so from all of these, what can we take from all of them? Which one do we like best?

42:00 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Well, not Jonas's, sorry, your one said a useful diagram, but not a graph, not the line graph.

42:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
We'll need to save this.

42:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bro, the text is too small.

42:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I'll save it later. So which one do you like best?

42:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
Mine has four nodes, and yours has three. So right now, I would like to test with three nodes, if it works.

42:38 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
These two are just, yeah, these are the same, right?

42:42 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Except the line that goes between the coach and collector, but I don't- I don't think that's really relevant. Yeah, because both of them have a router, I don't think. BWAS.

42:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, they're the same.

42:54 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so BWAS, what do you think of this one, starting with this one then?

43:18 - Biwas bhandari 
I work 10 kilometers and today I work 20 kilometers.

43:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah.

43:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, one thing we need to consider is are things like when the user does things like that when he says 2 KM and then 5 KM like we need to make sure we have a system where it updates the database accurately because for example it might try to do it might update the database first with 2 KM and then it does another call with 5 KM but really it should be doing the second calls should be for 7

43:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
so we need to make sure that's that's in place the database updated before every preceding check-in sorry like if the user checks in another five kilometers like you said if he checks in with another five kilometers so if we have the two kilometers updated and we can calculate that the entire day he already had two kilometers and then he went out and did five again yeah there's there's two options like one of them is just trust that the

44:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
llm will see the conversation history, which in the past, through my experimentation, it was able to do that. It never failed. But the other option is to every database update is the sum. So it just adds them together. I think letting the LLM decide is better, because if it's the sum, we're relying a lot more on conditional, like hard-coded things than the LLM. The LLM will just know, OK, no info, let's update it.

44:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
We just need to tell LLM to recognize all of the activities of today. So he'll sum it up himself. Yeah.

45:00 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Maybe, maybe later down the road, if we noticed the, the collector is, is it sucks at trying to figure out like multiple data points and adding them together, we can make a small little graph down here to help add an extra LLM saying summarize or like extract the, the data points for this in this category.

45:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Something like that.

45:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
It's the thing about the nice thing.

45:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

45:25 - Chinmay Pandya 
I was thinking of a fourth node because if the collector has too many responsibilities, it might not work.

45:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So, so we'll have to test around. Um, that's a nice thing about this graphs. It's really easy to test. You just change the prompts and add some edges. Yeah.

45:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
We just have to add a node and we have to just transfer the tools.

45:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:46 - Chinmay Pandya 
We have to transfer from coach, from collector to the support. Yeah.

45:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool.

45:54 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So in terms of the plan then, I'll leave Chinmay and D.Wes to discuss what you guys are going to try to do. Jonas is going to continue on the messages thing. I won't be on the project right now. I'll let you guys work.

46:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Are you guys both on tomorrow?

46:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yep.

46:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool.

46:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so I think tomorrow, sometime around midday, we can check in all together and see how things are going and how we can delegate a little bit better.

46:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, there's some issue with the check-in, the database check-in.

46:39 - Biwas bhandari 
What's wrong with it?

46:41 - Chinmay Pandya 
Like we have three check-ins, an update check-in, a create check-in, and get today's check-in, right?

46:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
Hello.

46:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah.

46:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, uh, the code as it was written for create check-in, it will always, it should return the latest inserted node or the data, but it always returns the data as null.

47:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
I see. So is that.

47:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, wait. I'll present my screen and show you.

47:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

47:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
So here.

47:37 - Chinmay Pandya 
You see this?

47:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

47:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
This is always not.

47:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so whenever you're trying to create a check-in, it will not return you the latest check-in which was created. And that's why the data is always null. And in the case of error, we pass in an object where data is null and error. So here, this was the original code.

48:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
So here we try to return something, but this will always be null. So this, it was causing error here. I think there's a problem with this function, this create function, which should be the latest inserted.

48:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Do you have experience with Superbase?

48:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
I do not have with Superbase. But what I tried to do here is, because it was not inserting, I just ran the code to, for it to insert, then I called the two days check and it will fetch the most recent again.

48:46 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I'll send you, let me send you the documentation for superbase SDK. It's very simple. You've worked with Postgres databases before, right? Yeah. Postgres, right?

48:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:55 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so you should have no trouble understanding it, and then it's just a matter of looking at the documentation reference.

49:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, yeah.

49:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also when you when you call get today's check-in, do you want only one single item to return or Don't just send link to one of them.

49:11 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, that's the wrong one sends link to super base slash SSR Sorry, I didn't get Is it different yeah, it's slightly different I'm talking about like just the basic API calls. Yeah, you were looking at the wrong ones. Like just these ones. Yeah, I just sent a link to one of them. It's not SuperBase.js we're using, even though that's the one that's still listed there. They're phasing it out and replacing it with SuperBase SSR. But the only difference between SuperBase.js and SuperBase SSR is how you create the client, not how you use the client. So just how a client is created and how authentication is performed is different. But how you make normal API calls, that's the same thing.

50:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

50:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
But the goal of the today's check-in function is to fetch one check-in or multiple check-ins?

50:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
One check-in. So, so every day there's one check-in object. And the idea is that every day the user checks in. So there's a new one that created every day for every user. Yeah.

50:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because the current code fetches multiple check-ins.

50:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
No, I think it does single.

51:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
So this is the today's check-in and it returns an array of anything.

51:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Oh yeah, there should be single there.

51:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I tried adding single, but since I didn't know superface that well. Yeah, no, I'll go, I'll go.

51:21 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Ask your boss.

51:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool.

51:23 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, there should be a single there, my bad. That was, yeah, pretty cool. Cool.

51:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
So, I'll love you guys.

51:31 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I'll let you guys go through whatever you guys need to go through. And then tomorrow we can regroup.

51:38 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, can I have this? Let me try this.

51:47 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Hello, hello? You have to set the output.

51:50 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Click up here. Then you can set the system output. Oh.

51:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

51:55 - Biwas bhandari 
You'll be Firefox. Oh.

51:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Hello?

52:01 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, you have to turn the volume up a lot. It's the same thing for me.

52:04 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
That is not speaking.

52:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

52:07 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Can you guys speak? Yeah, it's working. Oh, there. Okay. I was checking on the graph.

52:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
So one thing I wanted to ask is, are you guys going to be peer programming, or how is this going to be organized?

52:23 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
For me, what I think is best, I've never tried, I don't have experience with it, but just hypothesis is that maybe like a combination, maybe 40% peer programming and then solo. And that way, the peer programming is a mix of staying aligned, but also learning from each other.

52:42 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, so when you guys are getting on, probably message each other that you're online, and if both people are online at the same time, try to get in the call as fast as possible, sync up on everything, just get used to working in a team. And if you feel it's appropriate, start a pair programming sessions. I can say from experience that pair programming is one of the best ways to learn how to program and how to run a project ever.

53:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Cool, cool, cool.

53:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Alright, sounds good.

53:18 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

53:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Let me know if you guys have any questions.

53:26 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, thanks so much for your guys' time. It's been a bit of a long night, but yeah, enjoyed it. I had fun meeting you guys.

53:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay bye bye, have a good night.

53:38 - Biwas bhandari 
What time do you work? During the day, from 2 to 11 am. At night, I work more. Around 1 am.

53:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
You work more at night? I sleep at 1 am. My work is in the morning and afternoon.

53:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Yours is in the afternoon and night.

54:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
So do you live at 2pm? At night or in the afternoon?

54:08 - Biwas bhandari 
No, no, in the afternoon. Yeah, yeah. From 2 to 5 in the afternoon.

54:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, okay.

54:13 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so I live at that time as well.

54:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
I mean, I live from 9 to 1 in the morning and from 2 to 5 in the afternoon. So, I'll see you from 2 5 afternoon. You can come online then. We can collaborate. Okay, okay.

54:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay, bro.

55:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
When did you start working on Lightning?

55:15 - Biwas bhandari 
First I worked on it twice, using TypeScript. Then I switched to Python. And made 2-3 projects.

55:25 - Biwas bhandari 
And that guy messaged.

55:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Did you do any internship work? Not internship, I did both remote work. They were from Nepal, but they stayed in San Francisco. America.

55:41 - Biwas bhandari 
They gave me the job.

55:43 - Biwas bhandari 
So, I did it.

55:45 - Biwas bhandari 
Lang Graph.

55:46 - Biwas bhandari 
I haven't used it much. I've only used it in LangChain. Agent. Banana. Router. That's it. First time using Lang Graph.

55:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
But it's good. Yeah.

56:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
We'll figure it out.

56:01 - Chinmay Pandya 
There's no new code.

56:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's just LangChain. But the graph and nodes are different.

56:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
ok bro, let's meet tomorrow ok, today I am working on the collector now my quota is over so I will start again tomorrow morning if there is any quota, I will do it ok, I will try to figure out the collectors do you have the documentation link?

56:38 - Biwas bhandari 
Langchan's Superverse I haven't used. I was only using MongoDB and MySQL. I'll send you a link.

56:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'll send you the documentation link in the Discord chat.

56:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay. Let me know if you have any extra resources.

57:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

57:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
Where did it go?

57:23 - Biwas bhandari 
I sent it.

57:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
This was just a multi-agent. I was also looking at this.

57:29 - Biwas bhandari 
But it has a router.

57:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
It doesn't need a router. It has a supervisor in the code too.

57:43 - Biwas bhandari 
using supervisor, he was also using multi-agent collaboration using supervisor, he was using multi-agent collaboration actually in multi-agent, router is better we'll have to see I'll do it tonight, if there's any error I'll inform you, you can check it in

58:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
the morning If you figure out something or work on it, let me know. I'm sleeping, when I wake up, you go offline, I'll see.

58:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, bye bye, have a good night.""","Discussing Graph Designs Transcript (1).txt"

0:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello. Hey, how are you?

0:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, good. Very good.

0:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Perfect. Give me two seconds. I'm going to try to connect to my iPad. It's the first time I've done it through Google Meet, so let's see if this is going to work.

0:39 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

1:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is what I've come to just now. You take a look, I can run it down. So we start from the idea of phases that isn't necessarily, it doesn't have to be like a strict boundary for between the different parts, but it really improves the performance and it makes it a lot easier for the agents to understand what they're doing. And also it makes it more modular. Like, for example, onboarding can be done, you know, if we can check, has the user been onboarded before in a workshop? If so, then skip this step for different workshops. So we start with onboarding. I'm not sure what that will include. Maybe just run down the user, introduce them to the workshop. Then the first exercise will be finding the mission statement. For this one, you mentioned you wanted an analysis bot. This bot's only going, his only job is going to be researching, pretty much.

2:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I sent the link to Perplexity. Also, I think you asked a question regarding it, but I think we just kind of went over it.

2:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me share my screen with you. So I was helping JP come up with a name for his marketing thing while the working place was story. And I said, in essence, what you're doing is you're giving a company a marketing team. So crash the two words together and you have marketing. Marketing and he does say to search for it and There's a company already about to launch called marketing to market team dot AI which is Exactly what he's trying to achieve exactly They're launching in July. So we are behind the cash We're trying to have we're trying to decide whether he wants to pursue or hold work I think he'll he will pursue it. But if you go to market team that AI Let me put it into discord I think I found it by chance. Yeah. And then there's also a, um, a very impressive video. Uh, I'm putting it in there.

3:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, a lot of these things that we're seeing are the, the, if shit, like they, they, they have a great shop window, but they have no substance. So like Dante had a great shop window, but once we actually got into it, it couldn't do what it said it did.

3:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. I need there. So off the gate, first impressions is it looks like there. I think they're probably an Asian team. The, those, the AI images you're seeing there, there there's another company. Well, not necessarily a organization in China. That's working on multi-agent teams. I think it's called meta GPT. It's probably the least well the least Evolved version for multi-agent frameworks But it looks like it took the inspiration for the avatar directly from that the websites very similar Yeah, I think they're an Israeli company like I think they've

4:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
pivoted about five times to what you see today Yeah, oh I see a github perfecto So maybe I'm misunderstanding something, and you can try and educate me on this. So in my head, you would give us the raw capability to have a buff that does something, and we're just going to label that analytics, and another one that does facilitation, and we call it facilitator. But when you give us that buff, Doesn't really know what to do so jp will then have to train it and say right here step one here step two this is the objective you're trying to do so there will be some. How to be some engagement from jp to teach these bots what it's supposed to do. So does your job sort of finish with the sort of, here's an interface where you can go in and teach three bots. That's where I was thinking in my head, your job is finished. Once you do that, now you might advise him better ways to write prompts, to get the outcome he wants, but fundamentally, once you give him the raw capability, he cracks on. He has to do the work to actually turn the analyst bot into a bot that knows what he wants it to do, and the facilitator bot knows what he wants it to do. Is that sort of right?

5:56 - Jorge Lewis 
That's actually a good question. I haven't thought this through yet, but this is kind of where my thought process goes. With language models, it's really easy to get them to do what you want to, Like anyone without experience could do that, but then making it really accurate and, you know, good quality, like, uh, following instructions, the instruction set, anybody can write the prompts, but I feel like, What we do best with, with JP is probably hopping a call with him and him explained to us pretty much in a call live. He can tell us the bot should the steps of this process or this, this, and this, and we could write it in the, or he could send it over to as tech.

6:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, I suppose, in my head, does that mean that you sort of hard code?

6:47 - Jorge Lewis 
It looks like my computer shut down. You there?

6:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. All right.

7:02 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll speak from the iPad for now. So yeah, I was saying that I think it's not necessarily he's going to teach the bot because I feel like it's going to be a lot more efficient if we help him in that process. And something for like the analysis agent, specifically the analysis agent, he's not doing much marketing. Like he doesn't, the marketing, the analysis agent doesn't need much marketing knowledge.

7:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
No. So for example, if you look at the video on marketing, um, that about halfway down the page, you can see that they have a bath that's going out. And as they're talking about the brand statement, it's going out and doing some market analysis and bringing information back to the meeting, which is fundamentally what we want to do as well. Um, so yeah, they haven't, they haven't gone live yet. So we've got no idea what the substance is, but this is sort of what we wanted, what JP wants to create.

8:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, there's things that the analysis bot is going to be told what to look for, and JP is going to tell us that precisely, but it's not much. I think it's pretty close to accurate how we would make some sort of framework for JP to really make the bots do what he wants them to do.

8:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, I would imagine like if we were to have a conversation about this, the facilitator boss, like there might be seven steps in the workshop and so there would be a piece, there would be some part of the profile Of the vault where you say right this is a process bot and a process bot needs to achieve these seven steps Okay, how what you want me to do to get from step zero to one and then it would train that Okay, when that's finished, how do I go from one to two and two to three and three to four?

9:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah pretty much that I want to ask JP this. How was he able to transfer his skill set to us? Because I feel like these processes are very straightforward. Workshops are quite straightforward. Where does his knowledge set come into play?

9:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is a very small use case where it's a little bit of hygiene factor where his particular skill set is in analysis of strategic marketing plans and also in creating relevant content plans and the generation of ideas and then the expression and the ideation of stories to bring those contents to life. Not necessarily an execution, but coming up with the ideas. The platform is going to help him go beyond that into implementation, understanding the analytics, and then feeding back like, hey, we thought this idea worked. It didn't work here. Here's why we think it didn't work. Let's remake the content in a slightly different way and go again, as opposed to going back and changing the plan. So this is about, you know, overall allowing JP to become a The equivalent of a 50 person marketing agency, rather than just a one man band.

10:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I guess to put it in, into this scenario, his knowledge set would come into play by telling the, because the instructions are straightforward, but he would be telling, he would have to find a way to tell the agents how to, to brainstorm like he does. The things he does that are unique to his skill set. So for example, like going from one idea to another because that last one was too much this. What is the thought process for that?

11:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that will be a conversation that what I would imagine is once you give us the, or give him the basic capability, we would step through an actual workshop and we would go, okay, why did you decide that, JP? What did you think about? What did you do? Let's try to prompt to do that. Okay, let's do that step again and see if the bot now does what you would have done. Okay, cool. Let's go to the next step. So we would, over time, run a workshop in increments end-to-end where we would get JP to do it, pause, go back, code it, see if the bot does it. Okay, right now let's move to the next stop. A lot of this facilitation, I've run these workshops for years, so I would probably be a better facilitator than JP in this particular workshop, but he would have better knowledge of what good content is within the workshop, if that makes sense. So there'd be a partnership between both of us.

12:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Better content as in the actual like contents, the texts that you guys are coming up with.

12:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So for example, if there was like three sentences of the mission statement, he would have a better view of how to rank them or decide which one to help the customer choose.

12:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

12:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like, for example, um, you know, there's very unfortunate brand names that when you put them in the domain, because it's no, there's no casing and there's no spaces. You can start getting inappropriate words because our brain sees them rather than the words we want them to see. So he would be testing for things like that, saying, you know, I can't remember, there's a couple of domain names that are very funny. Like it's sort of, oh yeah. So when you have, it was something like Dr. Something, Dr. Jane, no, Dr. John.

12:54 - Jorge Lewis 
My iPad disconnected there, so sorry.

12:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, can you hear me?

12:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, there we go.

13:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry about that. It was Dr. John therapist, but when you read it, it looked like Dr. John the rapist because the way the brain separates out the words. So he would be picking up on things like that where I might not pick up on things like that.

13:19 - Jorge Lewis 
And those things, do you think it's realistic to be able to turn that into a prompt so the bot could use to kind of act like JP?

13:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
I certainly think that's the intention. I think once we have the raw capability, we would want to be able to, in exactly the same way in the coaching bot for ADAPT. There's going to be scenarios that are new and unique and have edge cases that I as a person are going right. What I don't realize is I've just now decided across 50 subconscious things about what the white thing next to say is and then how do I tease that apart and tell the bot what I've just thought about and why I suggest we would now do this as opposed to that. And that's the That's the real challenge here. Like when we used to work with high-end consultants, some of these guys have been doing this job for 35 years. They've never had to explain what they do to anybody. And so, I don't know, I'm assuming you're far too young to have kids. So believe it or not, I'm able to tie my shoelaces without a problem. I don't even think about it. When I was trying to teach my kids this, it was really difficult because doing something and explaining something are fundamentally two different things.

14:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
on how to tie the shoelaces. I just found a YouTube video and outsourced it, so it was a lot easier. But that's what the challenge here is, is when someone is good at something, the bot knows nothing. How do you go back to beginner's mind and, in essence, educate that in incremental steps through prompts to get that bot to do stuff? Now, what we want to try and do is do a first pass, and then you can just layer on more and more insight and personality in different scenarios.

15:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Is by chance, do you guys have a large data set of JP's meetings? No. Okay. Cause I can, I feel like the one solution would be to do that, to generate a data set with JP of him doing his work, his best work, and then using that.

15:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
What would that data look like,

15:31 - Jorge Lewis 
The transcript of the workshop.

15:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I actually think that could be detrimental because you'll have no context to why something gets said. You just know that something was said. I think it's better to understand and like, if I was watching, if I was facilitating JP or sorry, if I was analyzing JP and say, right, JP pause, why did you think that? Why did you say that? Okay. What led you to that? So I would, as a business analyst, I put my business analyst hat on and I would be like microanalyzing, why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? Because understanding the why of something rather than just the outcome, I think is more informative because it would allow the bot to adapt to more scenarios rather than just going, if you see this, then do that.

16:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's two sides of the same stick, really. On one hand, with your one, if you understand the why, you're able to fundamentally understand all the scenarios. But then again, if you just know from, if the bot can know from experience, i.e. It's trained into the model, how to behave, it can interpret in another scenario how to behave similarly, but with this new scenario. It's just the thought one versus thought two. That's the idea. We'd be trying to train it so that it could have a foundation of a thought process similar to JP. But of course, it would be, that would probably be a really hard one, we'd have to really look into it. Especially like, me personally, I have no clue what goes on in a workshop with JP. So I have no clue what the transcript looks like as well. But that was kind of an idea that I wanted to potentially put out there because I feel like the prototype doesn't necessarily need to be JP in a bot, it needs to be the to guide the like, I feel like putting JP in a boat is way down the line. I feel like the, these language models are probably too simple for that. And especially we don't have, like you said, it's like teaching someone how to tie a shoelace. It's very hard. We need to break it down.

17:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Quite a bit and with marketing there's so much stuff to Remember there's there's all sorts of issues here and that There's a level of where the juice is no longer work squeezing because it's too much effort to get something out of it But we what we're trying to do with this proof of concept is prove that the model works on that This isn't a question of you codifying the bot to become JP we want to know whether the model works where you give us the raw capability and JP can then codify the bot and teach the bot to do not him, but to do something that's good enough that it makes the process move forward. And then over time, we could go back and refine it. Because again, if you cross all of the stages of marketing, whatever that means, like you're probably looking at coding up 50 bots.

18:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
So better off that some of them are, you can flow through, and then there might be a couple of areas that he's going to go super deep on to have a unique position against.

18:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So how does it sound if we can get JP in a call and we can do a mock-up workshop of the mission statements and value propositions?

18:50 - Jorge Lewis 
It should be back this evening or tomorrow.

18:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I couldn't think of why we should use multi-agents in that. There's not much dancing, is probably the way to put it.

19:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
There absolutely is. Absolutely 100%.

19:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Where would the dancing be? Do you see it then?

19:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm going to make something up. This is to try and bring what my example of dancing is, but we'll see. So let's say we start the workshop, and it says, right, you've got two words on a screen, and everyone gets to vote. It's this one or this one. And so you might have honesty, integrity.

19:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Humor, serious, whatever it is. And so they're choosing all these things. Now, we already know. Let's say we're doing this for Adapt.

19:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
In real time, let's say the bot is looking, it knows, OK, adapt, weight loss, health coaching, stuff like that. So I'm going to do a bit of a market analysis. And I'm going, OK, what you don't know is that you're copying your competitor. You're going to sound exactly like your competitor. So these, FYI, these values might be true to you, but you are now, you're at risk of not differentiating your intentions or your values from your competitors, because this is what I would do. So when I run these in person and you're running these workshops, Part of the job of the facilitator and consultant is to bring all of your experience from other events to this meeting and go like, hey, did you know? Or what about this? So what I used to start my workshops, one of the things I would do, I would go into big banks and I'd run a workshop. I'd say, well, before we start, I've given you a blank envelope. I want you each to write down two words for how you're going to measure success of whatever this is. And invariably, if you've got three stakeholders, you're going to have 17 different measures of success. We're like, great. Not saying any of these are wrong. But for example, if we're only working with Carl day to day, what do you think the solution is going to optimize for? What Carl wants? So the first thing is, before we do the scope of the project, we need to get you aligned on what the one key metric is. And what is that measure of success that we can all rally around? Because if you don't have that, we as suppliers to you are going to get pulled left, right, and center and won't do a good job. So it's things like that. And then, as you say, I'm trying to think of another scenario. So let's say, for example, we were an ecological startup and we were about selling solar panels. And we ended up with a mission statement that was exactly the same as Tesla's. I'd expect the analyst bot in real time to say, that's too close to Tesla, guys. That's silly. So it's not waiting until we finish and then doing something. It's like, oh, hold on a second. They're coalescing around this. I'm going to go and do a market review to see if anyone else has something. Have I ever seen something like this before? And we would say, hey, there's a bit of a red flag here. Do something. Oh, shit. How do we know we called the Tesla? So for example, right now, I just told him marketing.ai. I had no idea that already existed. So he went away and did some due diligence and said, already there? Wow, shit. Imagine a bot going off and doing that for him.

22:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's what I mean by dancing. It's not like A, then B, then C. There's the facilitator doing A, B, C, D, E. But as you're going through that, content is coming up. And as content's coming up, the bot is analyzing that content for different things. There'll be the marker perspective. There could be the vulgarity perspective. There could be the sort of, do we think it's effective to your strategy of perspective? I'm trying to get the door open.

22:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Thank you, my friend.

23:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Thank you.

24:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
That makes sense.

24:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

24:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So I wouldn't, so I can't see the dancing in that.

25:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I can, I can try to walk through it myself. So the user gets on boarded with the facilitator or let's use that as an example. And let's say you are the, the user, you come into this, this workshop, let's, let's pretend it's a Google meets. Does that make that be realistic later down the road? If like you guys made it real time.

25:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe, yeah.

25:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let's say I'm the facilitator bot, you're the user, and read.ai is the analysis bot. The way multi-agent systems, or at least the ones we've worked mostly on, are conversational. They have the structure of a conversation. So this would be me saying, welcome, Cuan. Today, we're going to figure out what your one sentence is. We're going to start with this, this, and this. Let's get into it. And then the first phase, I'm going to call it phase for now, is finding the mission statement. What are, write 20, what would be the example in this case? He writes five mission statements or?

26:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
I have an idea.

26:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to run a brand values exercise with my wife for ADAPT with you and JP either tomorrow or Monday to bring this to life. And let's just keep it to that focus and then see how, how would you, based on what you've seen, what are the, how would we architect it? Would that make sense?

26:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Um, yeah, but also on that note of the analysis spot, so you, The analysis bot's pretty much only feature is to do research, right? Research what, though?

26:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
It will have one job to keep an eye on something and check that. Now, in theory, you could have a market watch bot, you could have a competitor bot, you could have every particular problem statement, you could have a bot really honed in, fixing that one problem. So if you look at what's the difference between a senior consultant and a junior consultant, they just work on more clients and they've got more stories to tell you. So if you think about the facilitator guides you through the process, but the participants are the ones who add value to that process. And so obviously there's the human one, the client. Which you're trying to generate outside from But if the other ones are going, oh, wow, that sounds like a really good idea. I've seen this work over here. Actually, that sounds really something that I saw in the automotive industry, that that could work here because this is health. So you're looking at, how do you cross-pollinate ideas? And so all these bots would have different objectives or different problem statements rather than having one bot doing all of it. So maybe it's not multimodal. But it's the idea that there are multiple bots working concurrently. So if me and a bot are having a conversation, there's another bot aware of that content and is responding to something in that content and going away and doing something anonymously and coming back and contributing to that conversation, which then changes it. So if that's not multimodal, fine. I'm just using that because of my ignorance. But that's the objective.

28:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Yeah. So. Well, I think what, yeah, what'd be perfect is you get that example over to us. That would be one. And then is this the ideal example to be using as a, as a prototype or perhaps have, is there a better one that we've just kind of forgotten? Cause we've already gone down this path.

28:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe, but I mean, the principle here is can we run a workshop? Cause everything's basically a meeting or a workshop at the end of the day. And can we have a bot guide a person through a process? Can we have other bots participate? Can we have other bots watch, observe what's doing, and contribute? So that's the exam question. It doesn't really matter, the meeting topic, because once you prove that this dance can work, this interaction can work, then you just change the scope. You may have more bots, or it's a different process, but it's fundamentally the same building blocks.

29:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the reason I'm asking is just because I can't see the dancing that you probably are. And that's just lack of, you know, dancing.

29:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I mean by forget about the word dancing. A facilitator is running a process. Something is said in that conversation that another bot is listening and going, you can't do that, or here's some information. Oh, I read this the other day. Oh, I do this. That's what I mean by dancing. There's a bot who's independently observing the content, the output of a bot to human engagement and contributing to that autonomously. That's what I mean. OK, yeah.

30:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I can see that. So do you want to continue with this example or you guys, I recommend just making a couple other examples and we can look through those as well just so that it's clear. But I do understand, I do understand now the idea you're going for. And it's, it is what I thought of, but the word dancing probably made it a little bit more abstract. So.

30:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, cool. Yeah. I just, I messaged JP. I'll see when he's back online. I know he's taking care of his mom now, so then we'll figure something out for Tuesday or Monday.

30:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

30:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

30:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Tomorrow or Monday.

30:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas and I are going to be available tomorrow over the weekend. We're going to be quite busy. We're traveling. So on Monday, we'll be back on our feet.

30:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

30:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where are you going back to? Where are you traveling to?

30:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
We're going to Vietnam.

30:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, nice. So are you both traveling all the time?

30:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Well, yeah, we travel together. We just started this year. So yeah.

30:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Nice. How long are you going to be traveling for?

31:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So in, what is it? In the first week of July, I have to go back to Hong Kong. And then on the second week of July, I have to be in the US for my brother's wedding. And then I'll be visiting family in Mexico for a while. And then from there, we don't know. So.

31:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. All right, listen, I'll let you know when I know about JP and then we'll get that set up.

31:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so just just so by the way, for the phases aspect, What is the negative thing that's in your mind when I say phases?

31:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because in my head, there were no phases. There is just the capability of having different bots. And then he would train them. So there is no phase. It's just a scope of the process.

31:49 - Jorge Lewis 
But then the workshop could be broken down into phases.

31:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
But what does a phase mean?

31:58 - Jorge Lewis 
It allows the bot to focus on one specific task more, more accurately.

32:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like if, for example, I don't actually know if it matters because I don't, you're using, I'm using the word dance that hasn't translated. You're using phrases, not trying to listen. What I, what I want to avoid is the sense of something being hard coded to only do something and to actually build innate capabilities that can be trained for a person to do a job.

32:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because if you basically have us, if you can give JP the ability to run workshops, and workshops have facilitator bots and participant bots, and participant bots can do different jobs. Then it's up to him to train it because then he can once you give him that capability He could say I'm doing a new workshop, right? I need a facility. I need but one facilitator type but to Market review and this is its job and we could have templates of prompts in the library so they can prime each of those bots But you're just giving Lego as opposed to

33:03 - Jorge Lewis 
solutions You're saying we shouldn't hardcode the bots, but the prompt of the bots is usually technically hardcoded. But you mean as in just, he can send us a revision and we can update it, or he can do it himself somehow?

33:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, my understanding is that in the same way I'm going to have an interface to teach the bot. How is that any different to this?

33:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it's pretty similar, but the difference is that yours is going to be providing feedback to the bot. His is probably going to be changing the actual prompt of the bot. His one's like going to be barebone at prototype. We shouldn't be trying to, if there, if the interface isn't necessary for the prototype, who's he showing the prototype to?

33:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know.

33:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it? It doesn't matter. I mean, yeah, if it's it's no one, then he can work with us to produce a prompt that gets good results, because we shouldn't be spending extra work trying to build the interface for for the system if that part if the initial part doesn't work.

34:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe.

34:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

34:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, yeah, so that's so Yeah, I'll get, by Monday we can start with this. Do you think JP will be good to go by then?

34:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
We'll see, yeah. It's not typical to run one, so.

34:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep.

34:38 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Well, thanks so much, Kevin, for your time. I'll get back to you regarding the contract probably going to be sent over tomorrow for Adapt. No worries. And for Story, we'll be just designing some more architecture. Probably the example would really help if you could get that. You think you'll be getting that by probably Monday, right?

34:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, which example?

35:01 - Jorge Lewis 
For the workshop.

35:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I've got to see when JP's available. I'm going to let you guys know. We'll schedule a time.

35:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Okay. That works. Yeah. Cool. Cool. That's good.

35:10 - Jorge Lewis

0:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye!

0:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Like I didn't like when I searched what do you mean by that like that was a great one, but I need to breathe I What part of the world are you in now?

1:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is talking about the marketing project.

2:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we've been going super, super, super deep in this on our own research and trying to understand it. I think, Jamie, I'm probably going to hand over to you to sort of give your thoughts and considerations of where you are right now. And this is more You know, Jorge, when we were speaking last week, you were sort of really challenging and asking good questions like, what's the purpose of the POC? Who's it going to go to? Like, is there a hard-coded version? Like, is there a super dirty version to prove the concept? And what are we actually, what problem are we trying to fix? We want to try and explore what is the right scope of something and Is there work I want to talk about, like how do we train bots and could we train individual bots and then migrate that to a multimodal bot in the future? That's another topic I'll come back to. And then JP, I think you've got some sort of questions in terms of the knowledge and aspirations around multimodal stuff.

3:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

3:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
First of all, my connection is pretty ropey at the moment, so I may have to reboot my machine because it looks like it's my problem. Anyway, I'll keep on going anyway in the meantime. Right, so multi-agent AI systems, that's really the core, that's the differentiator that we see. I think ChatGPT are going to release a new version very soon which incorporates this as a framework. Obviously there are existing frameworks available so it's something that everyone's going to have.

3:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
opportunity to use very soon, whether you have experience or no experience. So it's not going to be a differentiator in itself, because it's going to be ubiquitous. Everybody's going to be using it. We need to know, really, how quickly we can move through. I don't think it's the proof of concept, necessarily, as in, will this methodology work? We know it will work. And as time goes on, it's going to get better and better. So it is the future. We need to work out how quickly we can get on sort of riding the wave so to speak and have something tangible and something real that first and foremost we can go out to partners and prospects potentially with something credible to say hey look this is it working in reality rather than the concept. Even if it's very small scale, it's fine at the moment. We just need something to say, this is what we do, this is what we can do, this is our vision. And for them to go, wow, that's something that is next level. And it's that next level we need to get to so that we can then improve what we want to do but we need that initial sort of wow factor to show people without smoke and mirrors without saying this is a demo that we put together that looks like it works but it doesn't really in reality we need something sort of tangible so it's the ability for several bots to talk and interact successfully that's really where we want to get to sort of first base.

5:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
But it's very like like too much Yeah, so sorry, my sort of benchmark is that when they talk to each other, they don't just physically talk to each other, they make sense. I think that's the level we need to get to, so sorry. The things you're talking about is my base level. So where you get sensible conversation that's intelligent and reduced errors, critical problems, et cetera. So at least we can prove that in theory, We can take it and work further with it and make it even better, but at the initial stage, it works. And I think that's where we need to get to.

6:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think there's a couple of different attributes here. So there is the So you have a bot, and then what I'm referring to, maybe there's a better word and you guys can correct me, but there's a tuition of that bot. So that's just a raw capability. So how do we teach it, train it, write a prompt with the personality and a standard that what good looks like for a particular slice of a problem statement? So for example, let's say a bot, I'm gonna do something very stupid. It was an expert in spelling. So it's constantly monitoring the conversation, and it knows the difference between American lingo and slang and English, right? And it goes, oh, look, sorry, just want to point out, you shouldn't, it's not this, it's that, right? It's a very, very narrow job. That is focused on doing something. So we would need to have the robot that we then write, I think it's prompts or stuff, to tell that what it looks like and what is good. And so we would, as an expert, set the standard for that. And that could be brand values, it could be content ideation, it could be anything. So we need the ability to train the bot or tell the bot what good looks like, The second dimension is the interplay between bots, taking feedback in real time, and then enhancing. I think that's the multimodal aspect of what we're talking about. So one question I've had is, while you guys are building out the multimodal capability and the backend interface for adapters and stuff like that, is there stuff, like could we get a single bot and just start proving it good at doing a job. And so we can start training it so that when you give us the multimodal capability, we can transpose all of that learning over and the prompts. The reason being at the moment is it feels quite sequential. The market's moving so quickly that we want to start getting our understanding of what does it mean to train a bot, what data do we need, what's the right way to prompt, all that sort of stuff. That's going to take time. And can we get ahead of it with a single bot, completely parking the multimodal aspect for now, and then once you give us the multimodal, we should be able to move all those bots together. In theory, that was what was in my head, but you might go, doesn't work that way, but maybe it does.

9:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
What's the difference between multi-agency?

9:33 - Arif Harbott 
Let's say we're going to have, for argument's sake, there's five people in a marketing team. There's a planner, strategist, writer, whatever it is, right? You've got five people. Now, we will have to load the prompts for all five of those. So let's say we're going to be completely individual. They were never going to talk to each other. We would have to undertake the task of saying, right, planning bot, you're going to do this. Creative bot, you're going to do this. And they would never talk to each other ever. Now, what we're saying is we're moving into a world where they can talk to each other now, and we know that's a little bit more complicated. So can we kind of get five prototypes where we can start coding them up and then in the background while you're linking them.

10:17 - Arif Harbott 
I think that's what you're trying to say, Cuan. So there's step one is each bot has to have its own sphere of knowledge. Step two is can they talk to each other? Now, maybe they can never talk to each other. Unlikely, right? Because the tech is moving so fast. But maybe when we link them up, it actually makes no sense and we keep all five separate and you have to engage with them separately. We don't know. But we're just trying to say, is there a way for us to get ahead of this? So we can start doing things now as opposed to it takes three months to build the tech and then we've got to code up these five bots anyway. Is that right, Kurt? Have I summarized that correctly? Pretty much.

10:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
We know that a bot speaking to another bot is one area, but the other one is, can we start training a bot to be good at a particular job so that when you give us the second capability, we can just take that learning and move it over rather than starting from scratch?

12:12 - Eksno 
Yeah, so you're talking about multi-agents as a hypothetical. So I'm wondering if you've seen our previous project, Aetino, RF, is that correct?

12:25 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen it.

12:32 - Eksno 
multi-agents are a proven technology, they're already working, they're just not put to any practical use yet, so no one's using them for like a real purpose, it's mostly just scientists and researchers that are just testing them out, and we're

12:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
trying to use it for more commercial So you know, up until this point, whenever we've said multimodal, I think we mean multi-agent.

13:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ideally, the ultimate version of this is that the workshop is like this.

13:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that is vision, text, speech.

13:38 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a combination of all three.

13:45 - Jonathan Phillips 
So the picture of the Holy Grail is that we have this scenario here where your business owner, let's say, logs into his laptop and everybody's there spatially looking like a human, aren't humans obviously, and talk to each other as well as the person who's the user. So it's genuinely looking like a real team working interactively. And they may talk to each other and look at each other and say, hey, do you remember the meeting we had this morning? We talked about this, which clearly didn't exist. But it then relays back to the user that a meeting happened, and this is the output. So ultimately, that's the holy grail, and we're not there yet. But it won't take long. It won't take too long with the way that things are moving. But we need to get to the initial stages so that we're in place to put this into position, obviously, when we can do it.

14:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So on the multimodal stuff, The voice versions I've seen, there's a little bit of a lag. It's not quite as dynamic as text. So should we focus on a text-based solution today to understand the multi-agent dance, for want of a better word? And then in the future, once the voice comes into play and it's good enough, we could just move that in. Because the learning of how something... Because voice is just... All they're doing is poking the text. They're not actually changing the text. So maybe we just focus on a text-based version initially.

15:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Jonas, I have your hand up now.

15:16 - Eksno 
Yeah, so with like multi-modal, so audio, video, and like pictures, those are more going to be results from text. So for example, a team can, let's say a marketing team can collaborate to create a new marketing campaign. Then you can have one market or one designer, for example, that's an expert at generating prompts for image generation. So that designer basically can generate images for marketing campaigns. If you're generating videos, you can have one that's good at creating a script, which they then pass on to be converted to audio. And then the bots can create a marketing video, for example, or just marketing images. And it's not going to be the medium they communicate for. It's going to be medium that they produce, if that makes sense.

16:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
And we just had a call with somebody who's quite a sort of a seasoned consulting market here person. And one of the areas, and hence my question on how accessible is the web to LLMs, is sort of market research. So as you're doing something, there could be a bot going out doing some market research on the emerging information during a workshop and say, hey, you know, this is a, this is a $2 billion industry. There's like five main leaders in the area, this and this and this, because it's, yeah, that, that sort of real time dynamic that actually elevates, because generally if you did this in real life, you'd have the hour workshop.

17:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
And spending a week or two before you get that answer if we can do that in short circuit I'm familiar with it, I haven't used it personally though.

18:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. And in terms of the timing of stuff, I know you sort of said two weeks for a proof of concept, but I think that was the original proof of concept to prove, the point of that was to prove multi-agent stuff works. I think JP, from what you've been doing, the research you've been doing and things we've seen, that feels like a pointless exercise because I think we know that multi-agents do work. So I think we need to agree what the scope is So that we can get some high level timelines and costs so we can get that a contract signed over to jp to get moving Hey, i'm, sorry Uh, yeah

19:12 - Eksno 
so for The proof of concept how me and Jorge interpreted it was we basically create one workshop. So one like for example Last time we called about like creating mission statements, all of those things. So creating one workshop, which simulates one item, which you want to solve as a proof of concept. So proving the marketing team, not proving that multi-agents work, because we've already proven multi-agents work.

19:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

19:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so if we look at that as a scope, and JP, I don't know whether this is still a valuable one to say, let's do a brand values workshop. Yeah, it's it generally in real life. It's a, I mean, the only issue is I'm doing brand values. You know, I don't see that need for multi agent in that context because. There's no like, there's just pick your values. Yes, no, yes, no. Like there is no like, Oh, what about this or that way?

20:14 - Arif Harbott 
Maybe there might be someone going, Oh, you've picked three brand values that links to your closest competitor. I've gone out and done a web search. You told me that you're a B2B and your brand values sound more like a B2C. And again, I have no idea if this is possible. I'm thinking as a human, that's what I would be thinking as a human. I'm not a marketeer. Right. So again, I don't even know why I opened my mouth, I was just trying to get nervous.

20:39 - Arif Harbott 
It's very valid, very valid.

20:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, probably the most valuable thing you've said in about three weeks, so that's good. Every three weeks.

20:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Again, in this proof of concept, I think one of the ways we talked about it was that you would basically give JP the ability to say, create new bot, I'm going to name this facilitator. This facilitator would then have to follow these steps, step one to two, two to three, three to four, and then there'd be a script or prompts or training for it to go from one to two, two to three, three to four. There'd be a second bot that might be doing market research or You know usefulness of a value. I don't know whatever like hey, you've chosen three values. They're all the fucking same That's not that's not going to you know serve you or not very compatible with your industry, whatever whatever the problem is There's the you give us the lego blocks and jp builds houses versus you build him a house That's not can never be anything else because it's really a for want of a better word a hard-coded proof of concept But I do think we want to prove that JP can train something, not can you make it happen. If you get the difference, I don't know whether I'm explaining that right.

22:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, no, it does.

22:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that's a good question. One, I think, as I tried to explain the other day, it's very, very difficult. Like when I was trying to teach my kids how to tie my shoelace, I tried their shoelaces. I found it really, it's something I just know inside of me. I found it really difficult to explain it. And this other guy I just found on YouTube, so I just use that. I think the amount of time it'll take for certain aspects of it It's JP telling you something. It's going to be a very iterative. That didn't fucking work. I'll try this. No, that didn't work. Try this. Oh, that didn't work. Try this. Oh, okay. Now it's doing what I want. So there's a degree of JP learning how to speak to the bot, to telling you, and then you making something up. And I think that will be a very costly loop because we could go around multiple times because it's quite nuanced what we think good is. It's not like, you know, it's, it's more, Yeah, you're not drawing a square. You're drawing a landscape. So it's far more nuanced than it's just these four steps.

23:26 - Eksno 
On that, what we can do or what we'll probably need to do is most of the structure behind it, but for specific prompts that we're passing to the agents, those we can probably quite easily expose to JP, so he can fine-tune the prompts. That would be one way, or the closest you can go to training them.

24:38 - Arif Harbott 
because I don't think we have Jonathan's 30 years of experience written down so I think there's an element of him trying to identify what he does in an iterative process and then making sure that what he's thought about actually

24:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
comes out in the So how long, A, I know you're working on Adapt and other stuff, so when do you think you could start and how long do you think this will take to get something out that we can start playing with?

27:33 - Eksno 
Yeah, it sounds possible. But yeah, if we have some margin, I'd say at least keep the expectations to two weeks.

27:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, if we can escalate this instead of adapt, again, I don't know whether they're mutually exclusive. Because there's a bigger unlock on giving JP the raw capability, go back and do some adapt and then when JP's learned we come back. So what we're trying to do is just not block JP. This is so short where adapt is sort of 10 weeks.

28:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Don't want JP waiting for Maybe there's an initial bit that's actually aligned for both of them.

29:10 - Arif Harbott 
works from the demo. All of these things look great in marketing videos, right? I watched the chat GPT-O video and it looked amazing. Whether me as a human interacting with it would get the same output given the complete unstructured That's what we want.

30:01 - Jorge Lewis 
If that helps you.

30:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I was coming up with names and I said marketing, what are we actually giving people? We're giving them a marketing team. And I just made up, I've had marketing, marketing. And then JP just went, you're not going to fucking believe it. It's already, it started as a domain search and there was there and it was like, I think JP, you've done some more research. On those guys. They've been around for a long time.

30:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, they're four years old and they basically started out as an ad agency and then moved into tech and they have a single assistant live at the moment so they have a bot which is trained for social media and then they thought why can't we train other bots? And then obviously the realization recently that most people are talking about sort of multi-agent systems, they're thinking, let's now create a team. So they've got a head now on the demo, the smoke and mirrors to make it look like they have a team, but they don't. They're still building that very fast.

31:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
it's done recently. So they spent two years trying to build LLMs that were sophisticated. And now they're so sophisticated, all their work really has been trashed, which is obviously good. It's going to be the same for everyone at the moment, we're racing to keep up. But they've had a lead on us. But at the same time, a lot of their time has now been well, unfortunately for them, it's useless.

32:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yes, nearly all technical people Yeah, I mean they got two million in funding apparently two two million dollars so they have a Obviously a run of money as far as building a team.

32:34 - Arif Harbott 
I Think they were building a lot of the things that we've just got for free so they were building a lot of features and It's just when technology is moving this fast. You don't quite you've got to get ahead, but equally you don't know if suddenly tomorrow is going to be doing exactly what you've spent two years building. Who knows, right? You've got to take the risk. So I would imagine they've lost quite a lot of their funding and they're going to require a lot of that. At the time of a team of 15 people, they're going two years and they probably lost a lot of what they've done. Yeah, you know, building that out. They didn't say when, but they are starting to talk about it. I've watched some of it on some of the use cases that they came up with. And actually, in the demo, they had two instances of ChatGBT talking to each other in one of their demo videos. So it's really cool.

33:58 - Jorge Lewis 
You can't get out of this!

34:37 - Arif Harbott 
we're thinking is, if ChachiBD did come up with multi-agent, brilliant. We'll just take what we've got, we'll pivot over, because what we're coding is Jonathan, and OpenAI is not going to code Jonathan anytime soon, right? They're going to give us the infrastructure and capabilities to allow us to do that cheaper. Maybe it takes us six months. In the next iteration, another human can code themselves in three months, two months, one month. But I think this is what We're so keen on the knowledge inside the box is what's important, but they can talk to each other. We're hoping soon that's a commodity. And as it gets better, great for us, because the better our product and service becomes, we're starting off with that. It's going to be a bit clunky for them talking, understanding the tech will catch up with our vision.

35:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
So I love the ability to do it, obviously. When it first started, it was amazing. The issues I have with it are version control. So if I add a number of things to it, I can't at all rewind. I know that's part of LAPD. But if you do it in a GPT, it ruins it completely. So you've got to start again. So what I'd like to be able to do is take a cut at a certain point and clone it and then keep it aside. But when I mess up, so to speak, that can go back to a previous level. So I think that is essential when you're trying to teach it because it's so easy to teach it incorrectly. And then if you say undo what you did, it just doesn't do it.

36:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Similar to JP, and you're quite limited, I think, in the, or I haven't worked out how you can really brain it, for want of a better word. So for example, you can write a prompt, give me 10 social media content ideas. All right, that's a prompt. It's a completely valid prompt. However, if I had a number of checkboxes that says, here's a number. Oh, so you want to write social media. OK, here's three personalities I can act as that we would suggest you use. Do you want to use one or all of them? And I would just go, yeah, I'll use all of those. OK, I found this a bit vague. Tell me a little bit about your industry. OK, so it would then clarify the prompt and then say, right, this is now a good prompt. Do you want to use it? And I go, yes. So there was no guidance in, in how to get the best out of us. So you can make progress really easily, really quickly. And then you're like, I don't know how to improve it. It was no guide.

37:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
I did on chat GPT. I did a very basic sort of coaching one and stuff like that. And you know, it's a little bit like Dante in that you can get Progress really really quick. I think it's really difficult to like Dante had all these glass ceilings that we would just hit on and Because it's inside and there are IDE for one better word You are completely controlled unlimited by how they foresee the world and how what levers you have to make it better Where the whole point of going with you guys and long chain is what it might be slower to get going but not as slow as it used to be ten years ago and If we wanted to add in new levers or new constraints on the model, we could get to do that. No problem.

38:40 - Jorge Lewis 
They're free at the moment.

38:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
The difference is that like for example if you were gonna write a AI scrum master and Someone could do that today by just going and getting the scrum guide and saying, follow that. That's what most marketing bots are going to be. Just do marketing by the book.

39:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a learning process called going through the you where you learn stuff. And at some point you reach this impasse where you just go, this is all horseshit. And I now know how to break this model while still achieving the outcome. Most people never go through that learning process. So myself and Ara, for example, we know how to break any delivery methodology in order to achieve an outcome given the constraints and the context of the client. Which is always different. You can't just say, take Scrum and apply it in a context of a behemoth organization with fucking governance up the wazoo. That governance isn't going to change. And so you've got oil and water trying to mix, and you've got no emulsifying agent. And so this is what we mean by expertise. We're codifying the expertise. We back ourselves in our own respective areas to be world class. So someone can do marketing, doesn't mean it's good marketing. They can follow the process, but they're not going to give you the same outcome.

40:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the goal of this still, because when I first started before I said what should I do about this, the goal was to educate while you're executing. Is that still the goal? No. No, it's a marketing agency.

40:44 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, it's pure.

40:45 - Arif Harbott 
Imagine you're going to a marketing agency today and you're saying, here's £50,000, after my marketing.

40:52 - Arif Harbott 
And obviously, we're not going to charge £50,000, that's the kind of concept. We can't do marketing internally because we're a small business. We want to give that to someone who's an expert because I want to focus on coding or I want to focus on consulting, whatever it is I do. I want someone to take that marketing problem away. The difference is when the marketing agency is done for you and they go, there it is. Here, it's going to be directed, it's going to be led by the founder or someone in the founding team. So it's like, do this marketing for me, it will come back and there will be some interaction.

41:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
And you also want an element of coaching in there as well. So potentially you can have a business advisor or coach plug in. So they're the conductor. So if you'd have zero marketing or business knowledge, then at least you have somebody supporting you who knows what they're doing. But ultimately it isn't a 10, 20, 30 man marketing agency.

41:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
to confirm the timing, you think you could get a V1 in a week?

42:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Give or take.

42:05 - Arif Harbott 
We're not going to hold you to a day, but roughly, we're not talking about six months, we're not talking about one day.

42:20 - Arif Harbott 
finished, I'm not saying done, but we want to get to a point where Jonathan can start playing with it.

42:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you can send over a proposal on a contract to JP, from my own point of view, you guys have been quite amenable to feedback on the contracts for ADAPT. So in good faith, I'm not delaying things because it's probably going to take a number of days to back and forth just to clarify with JP.

42:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
If we can make progress But again, if what you're doing on adapt is it is a no regret moves for for what JP needs as well Then we just crack on and we'll get the contract shorted at parallel Yeah

43:16 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, most of my career has been running technology teams for, firstly, startups, but latterly, post-MBA, very large companies. So I launched the Morrison's Online Business, which is a grocer in the UK, helped launch TSB Bank, which is a big bank in the UK. I worked for Booker, which is one of the largest wholesalers in the UK, launched their, or grew their e-commerce division. And then the last kind of For six years, Cuan and I have been working together at Alex Partners. I was the digital CTO there. And the last kind of six months, I've been leading the Virgin Media O2 technology teams. So it's about, depending on the day, but about 650 of tech spend across the telco. My job is to get that to 500 million. So I started the year at 717 million. I'm down to 650. I've got to get to 500. So it's a pure modernization cost takeout play. Modernizing the telco infrastructure but also trying to reduce the costs of having like 50 Oracle contracts or some huge Netcracker suite where you can do it at like a fraction of the cost of a smaller company. So it's a modernization but""","Discussion for Stori with everyone Transcript.txt"

0:00 - Jorge Lewis 
You're a dick.

1:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye!

1:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Good evening. How are you guys?

1:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Doing good.

1:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
Excellent, excellent.

1:46 - Jonathan Phillips 
How has the week been?

1:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Long.

1:52 - Jorge Lewis 
The weekend, I started travelling on the 2nd, the morning of the 2nd and it's now the evening of the 4th and I haven't slept yet. I don't know, I'm not tired yet. It's been 40 hours and we're still going good. So hopefully like 30 minutes in, I'm not just like, it just hits me. So we can hope for the best.

2:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
We've got two North Lakers now.

2:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jonathan's no taker on redeye.

2:24 - Jorge Lewis 
That's not your guy?

2:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
No.

2:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wait, huh? I assumed it was yours, since your name is Jonathan Phillips?

2:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yep. No, I don't know where that's from You want to remove it from the call?

2:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, I mean, we could have...

2:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
the fifth And then it's just like some bot that scans through like Google Meet meetings and just joins what run of the people's random usernames as meeting notes, trying to like get into internal meetings.

3:03 - Jonathan Phillips 
Crazy, crazy. I don't know if Colin's going to join us. He said he wasn't feeling well a few hours back. So I think we should obviously move forward without him at the moment. And if he feels a bit better, he can join us and catch up a bit later.

3:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we do have our meeting, our note guy, so no problem.

3:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
And that's the real one. Yeah, that's the real one.

3:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

3:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

3:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Imagine you just turn, the camera turns on and it's like this.

3:36 - Jorge Lewis 
It is.

3:39 - Jonathan Phillips 
Cool. Okay. So, discussion on IP. So, Coen raised the point.

3:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't know what he discussed with you. I don't know what has gone on previously. So I think the best thing to do is if you guys just start from your perspective and what's in your heads, so we can just sort of roll from there.

4:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so for sure. So for us, we have two. So our main goal is that we want to make really cool stuff. That's the main goal. And to do that most efficiently across multiple projects, the easiest way to do that is reusing components, right? But of course, reusing components still has overhead and there's a lot of things related to this. So what I want to do, what I want to start with is our goal, your goals and our goals. And I want to reiterate what I think is your guys' main concern. Because if we don't understand your guys' main concern, then we're going to be going in circles. So I'll start off with the main concern to check that we have that and then we can go into the goals. So if we understand it correctly, the main concern is that we're going to give, or is that we don't want to give anyone else the ability or the capability to kind of use what we make here to make them a competitor for Adapt or IntelliAgent.

5:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, in a nutshell, it's twofold. So one, and this has happened millions of times before, so this is why people build this into contracts. So ultimately, As a completed project, as a client, the concern is that the completed piece will be taken and touted to other competitors, our competitors, so that you say, hey, we've got a completed platform here. Do you want this? That's obviously something that does happen in the world. So that's something that is kind of protected from a client perspective. OK.

5:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
The other sort of thing that happens is that major components of the project, so we're not talking necessarily about the deep-seated code here and the libraries as such.

6:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
protection is for the client, us, not to have, again, the developer sell elements of what they've built to other customers in a commercial sense. So using them yourself to create other things isn't necessarily an issue as such. It's kind of almost boxing them up and then selling them on. I think it, does that make sense? It's not very good at explaining it. So I apologize.

6:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think, I think, I think both of them can kind of wrap around to that. You don't want anyone using what we make. Any in any way to kind of shortcut or to as a shortcut or as a complete solution to become a competitor?

6:59 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sure. Sure.

7:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So in a nutshell, yes so So I mean also example example If we were to take an example, let's say we built the UVP workshop, the whole system, we have it all done.

7:26 - Jorge Lewis 
And we're able to extract the graph, the architecture of the AI agents, and we change the prompts and everything. So that it's not a marketing system anymore. So there's no relation to marketing anymore. And we perhaps put that on our GitHub as an open source repository.

7:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Would that bother you? And if so, why?

7:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
Potentially that could bother us because we might want to use the code and say, hey, we're going to attack 20 of the markets using the same principle, the same platform, but in different categories, in different verticals. So that might be part of our commercial plan to take the whole platform and then to say, let's do, roll out five, 10 products from that in order to utilize the sort of infrastructure, the architecture.

8:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Makes sense, yeah. Okay, and then another example, so that one that I gave has good reason why you wouldn't want us putting it out there. Another example would be, and this is the one that we want to kind of focus on, are the very small components, something like the typing UI, or the typing animations that make the chatbot interfaces, and I don't I'm not a IP lawyer here, but I think those, for example, if we build it for IntelliAgent, and we build it from scratch again, that's no longer your IP, but our IP, the new one. Because number one, it's so generic, those components, and number two, it's done from scratch. So those are the two big components into determining that. So those are the main components. Jonas, do you have any other examples that we can use as good reference points.

9:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the one that came up, the fake streaming, basically literally copying how chat GPT looks when it's typing out as a feature.

9:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

9:52 - Jonathan Phillips 
See ya.

9:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
So my perspective, I don't want to be the big bad wolf or anything like that. So as far as I'm concerned, you guys are partners, we collaborate, we try and make great things, we try and have fun doing it. So it's not a case of trying to be greedy and have everything. Is just a business protection sort of conversation. My perspective may be different from Cohen's, his background is different to me and he's more technical. As far as I'm concerned you guys have got to make a living, you guys have got to build on what you're doing week by week, month by month and you don't start from scratch every new client. It doesn't work like that, and I fully understand that you'll be building things that are your intellectual property. So I think as far as the IP lawyers would be concerned, they'd say if you were building something on the client's time, then that belongs to the client. So if you were building building something for another client, even at the same time as our project, that's their IP. So what I'm saying is that everything you do isn't necessarily ours because you're building it for us. But when you're building something for us, that kind of falls within the project remit, which is kind of the IP of the project. I don't know exactly. I don't know the exact granularity and the detail that we get to where we decide where the line is. I don't know. That's open for discussion, completely open for that. And again, I'm not necessarily anal about everything that you do. I mean, to me, it's more of a big picture. I think Kieran might be a little more interested in the granularity. But I just want us to get on. I want us to all enjoy what we do. I want us to make some exciting projects together and go forth and hopefully have successful opportunities to commercialize everything we do. You guys and us, because if you're not successful, and you're working with us, then we're not successful either.

12:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Am I cutting out? Yeah, that's a great way to put it. I would say I totally agree. For us, it's a matter of, I think it doesn't need to be wrapped onto papers. It can be more of such. We understand that we don't want to introduce competition to you guys, number one, because we prefer you guys as clients than hopefully other guys. But of course, that's going to be in hindsight. But the idea is that, at least from a logical standpoint, other competitors, the market, we're partnered with you guys, then you guys do better and hence we do better. It's the same example that you gave.

12:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And in terms of granularity, I think we'll always have to respect that what we make during the duration of your project has to respect your We can go into the fine-grained details, but I think there's a mutual agreement that, on our side, don't introduce competition, and that is backed by the obvious things being under your IP. In the contract, there is a section regarding that the code does belong to you guys.

13:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Am I cutting out or?

13:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, you're cutting out.

13:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me turn off my video.

13:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, maybe we should turn off the cameras. Try to speak now, Jorge.

13:58 - Jonathan Phillips 
Hello?

14:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is it still lagging?

14:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's getting better now.

14:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe. It's better now.

14:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cool.

14:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, Jeff, are you still with us?

14:27 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, we're with you.

14:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, cool.

14:34 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so under the contract, I don't think we've signed it with you yet. Actually, no, we have, I believe. Have we?

14:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't think we have. No, I think because we've kind of muddled through from a proof of concept to MVP to whatever, I think we've kind of missed a few stages. And obviously you've been working with Kuhn on other things. It's not a major issue whatsoever. The way things are going at the moment, you know, I'm absolutely fine with. So I think it would be good at some point to have some documentation in place, protects both sides. It's a very positive thing, not a negative thing. So maybe we can put something together in the next week or so to just to make sure everybody's comfortable with where they stand.

15:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so with QN we sent the contract over and there's a section for that for the IP stating that most of what we make belongs to QN. The copyrights, patents, all that. I think how we can move forward is just being really open about everything we do. So asking, hey, is it cool if we reuse this? We believe this and this. Sound good?

15:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I'm happy with that. I mean, obviously, I haven't seen the documentation, the IP clauses, etc. But by the sounds of it, most of it's in place. I'm not really sure, you know, over and above that, what we need to do. Obviously, I need to see it first. But if it's pretty much what we've been discussing, then yeah, on a case by case basis, let's discuss what granularity, what levels we need to potentially have a discussion over.

16:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't think I explained it very well at the start. What we want to do with reusing the code is, number one, the obvious one is reusing it for other projects, but number two is also we're really big into open source stuff. We want to be at the forefront of this AI stuff and do it with open source stuff. We've always been big into it. We'd be ideally publishing these repositories. With these code components that people can use. For example, one of the repositories could be a templates project for a chatbot. That's nothing fancy, it's very basic. Another example, Jonas, if you want to help me out, let's see. Another example is I have a Read.AI tool that I use to help scrape Read.AI or listen to Read.AI posts and determine if they're leaks or not. That's open sourced on our post, I believe, or it's going to be when I clean up the code. But just things like this, we're really big into it. The license we put that source code under, could be either under a business or a license that allows people to use it for commercial use or not. So that's also another thing we can discuss.

17:49 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, so my perspective on that sort of thing, at that level, I don't personally have a major issue with that. Obviously, you could tweak the licenses to make it possible people to use for their own use rather than to, or even build into projects but not actually sell it on themselves. I don't know. Again, different levels of...

18:19 - Jonathan Phillips 
of usage. I think the major thing that, from my perspective, is we want to protect is anything that differentiates the product. So what would give somebody a shortcut into building something that will be equivalent to what we have? I mean, that's an obvious statement, but that's the kind of level that I think we're talking about.

18:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. One solution that we thought of was instead of worrying about kind of like all these granularity levels, is we have kind of a general clause where it's a non-compete. The main idea is that it's a non-compete, where whatever we publish, whatever we do with code from your guys' projects that we made during the development of your project, then we can, as long as it doesn't lead to someone competing with your guys' products.

19:19 - Jorge Lewis 
That's also an idea.

19:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Basically that we won't engage with clients and deliver them products if they have a similar business to yours. So like right now with just the regular IP clause, if another marketing agency saw the work we did for you, they could come to us and pay us to make a similar platform or a slightly different platform. And we could cleverly avoid it, but with a non-competes clause, we'd just engage with other businesses. We could still do a lot of what the core aspects are from the other application, but we'll make sure that none of our clients are competitors of yours, if that makes sense. More so than focusing on specific code segments.

20:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, ultimately, there's levels of trust. And that is something that you build up over time with partners, and you become close collaborators. And I think that there's got to be certain levels of trust within the relationship. And you can't necessarily document all that. So I think there's a balance there between what we document and the way that we act as as decent humans.

20:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, one concern, Jonas, that I'm thinking of now, that non-compete thing, is if a client, if a prospect would come to us saying, I want to build pretty much IntelliAgent, but for business development or something for another industry. That would bother JP, like you said, what if they have plans to expand into different industries using all the same tech. So that would be something to consider as well. Thanks for watching!

21:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely. The one problem with that is like, I think if it comes down to something like that, it's very hard to put in a contract, even with the current one we have, where it's basically you own, like the client owns all the code. We could just cleverly make the same solution in a slightly different method. Same thing with the non-compete, we could argue it's not a compete, so I think that's where it comes more down to the trust more so than regulation.

21:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I should actually ask, so I've spoken to quite a few people, most like people that outsource development, like you guys are. And they post their stories on Read.AI and I ask them and I have a chat with them. And they do have IP, they have the contracts in place with IP sections. I'm gonna ask them to send it over if possible. But they always end up, it always ends up coming down to, does the development agency value your relationship more than you know, making a buck, a big buck with another client potentially. So yeah, like, like JP said, just trust is kind of what it all comes down to because with IP and cover, it's so, so gray area, whoever has more money and better lawyers, it's like, you can, you can argue your way out of there.

22:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's also tricky because like you say, what level do you, do you include as the IP? So for example, We're discussing there about which category or industry that the platform is used in. However, we might say the IP is on the chatbot. So you guys can't sell a chatbot to anybody. And then it gets to a silly level where you then can't run your business. So, and even if we have an IP in place to protect what you've done, you could build it slightly differently and say, Hey, that's not the same. Thing. So it does come down to a level of understanding and a level of collaboration and I think we need to maybe discuss that a little more in some areas but I do think that we started well in the relationship and there's no reason at the moment to change the course what we're doing maybe we can tighten down some of the IP contract but ultimately there's always a way around something so it's just a I think a discussion on

23:26 - Jorge Lewis 
how we're going to conduct ourselves I think is the key thing yeah yeah I agree with that yeah So how we can move forward then is, what we can do is do more research on these contracts, what's kind of the norm in the business and the usual pitfalls for both sides related to those contracts. And I think we'll also consult with an IP lawyer and see if they can help us.

24:04 - Jonathan Phillips 
In my experience, a lot of the projects I've worked on, what happens is the bigger organisation come in with their lawyers and say you can't do anything at all and then the smaller organisation tries to negotiate looser terms and then you come to an agreement in the middle and it does depend on how big, obviously with guys and us there's no big company involved but ultimately the the bigger the lawyers you suggested before and the more knowledgeable IP rights lawyer they're the ones who hold the power ultimately because they're the ones who can put the loopholes in and can wiggle out of things let's say so we can put as much down as we want on paper which I think we should and I think we should because at least it gives us an understanding then to start from but ultimately it is based on trust While we were speaking, I just had a little idea.

25:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
I haven't searched into it at all or anything, but I just thought, what if we just splice one lawyer that mediates with us and we pay that lawyer just equally? And then have him come up with the fairest clause, basically. I wonder how that would work, where both of our parties present their own concerns, and then the lawyer helps come up with the fairest clause possible, where both parties are happy.

25:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
That's a good scenario. Let me speak to Kieran first because he might, he's got a little more experience with the corporate world as far as the legal aspects and then we can sort of move forward and we just want to come, like I say, to an understanding. It doesn't really matter how, where, what. We just need to be able to be comfortable that we're all covered and you guys move forward and you're happy and we're happy.

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think it's important to understand that on our side, the risk is very low. We have little to lose in terms of this because if we were to, there's a lot of loopholes that we can exploit, whereas for you guys, it's very risky. You guys have something that's supposed to be yours. We have built something that's supposed to be yours.

26:31 - Jorge Lewis 
You guys are the ones with the more risk, so it'd be definitely prudent for you guys to be looking into this. I had a point where I was going into this, but I think I lost it.

26:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Give me a second. Confident to say we don't have the funds for lawyers.

26:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
There are lots of templates and examples online. I mean, ultimately, we don't need to be paying Too much to third parties. I think we can do some research and cobble something together That will satisfy both sides yeah, I Think it's only if any of us have a problem with anything that's documented that we then may need to get some advice on I think but ultimately there's enough out there for us to base.

27:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I think of very strong Piece of paperwork that we can both be very happy with I think my whole point was just to put it out there that for us, it's a matter of increasing how happy we are. For you guys, it's a matter of not risking something. I think that was just the whole point, just kind of making it, putting it out there that you guys are under the more risky position in this.

27:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I mean, it is, because ultimately, when this gets put together, I'll have spent a whole year trying to work through it and make it work. And then obviously, you want some return on that. And at the same time, You know, we want to work with you guys longer term. So we hope that there'll be no fallout, but you never know. Not all relationships go on forever. So that's the reason that there is levels of protection. And that's the reason we're talking about it. We hope we never, ever get to the point where we'd have to start to get to the point where we start to quote the paperwork. But it's there for your protection and ours. But ultimately, it's got to be, even though you say it's more of a risk on our side, both sides have got to be equally happy. Because if they aren't, there won't be a relationship.

28:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Relationships need them to be happy, not them to be, what do you call it?

29:00 - Jorge Lewis 
just married because of the children.

29:03 - Jonathan Phillips 
Exactly. Very much so. Cool. I don't think there's anything more we can do now.

29:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
I will have a chat with Kerwin, and we'll take it forward. And ultimately, we'll get some paperwork in place that we're both happy with. But it's not a major deal. I just think it's something it's good to get discussed before we get going too much further, just so that there aren't any problems going forward. And I just think that helps a little.

29:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. No, I totally agree.

29:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely. For this is something we can easily work out.

29:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And it's something that we do have to educate ourselves more on as well. That was kind of what I was suggesting with consulting a lawyer because it's less so the paperwork, more so understanding where both sides stand in terms of general law and ethics.

29:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. Very much so.

30:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

30:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
Cool.

30:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So if you don't, if you don't mind, we can just quickly go over kind of the plan for intelligence. Um, since you sent that last Thursday, I believe.

30:10 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, yeah, because I've got another 10 minutes before I've got to do some taxing for children. But yeah, if we could go over it, no problem.

30:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So just, uh, yeah. So you sent it, sent it a couple of days ago, past nine. So last night and as he, for the two main developers on the project, um, you've met, have you met either of them?

30:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think I did on a call. Yes.

30:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we met, uh, wait, no, you met, you met in a Zeef not, um, past nine, I believe. I think, maybe. So they're going to be the main developers on the project. I'm of course going to be working on the AI side. Jonas is going to be here and there, all on the dev side. So we're going to go over through the documents. You sent a lot of stuff. Thanks so much. Bye. Helpful over the time, but I think... A lot of stuff, a lot of stuff.

31:04 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sorry, sorry, let me say first, I don't expect you to read it all and understand straight away. What I want to do is create a level of understanding where you don't have to ask too many questions, you can always revert back to the documentation to start with. There'll be areas that you won't ask questions early doors, I understand that, but ultimately, the more comprehensive it is, the better direction you can go in to begin with, and I think that's important.

31:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm about to create like a full-ass AI solution and like talk to your documents just to comprehend that.

31:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
You can stick it into AI and ask for a summary so that might be helpful.

31:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I went through the one document that I have gone through at the airport the other day was the document for the developers. I can't remember what was the name but A lot of cool stuff in there, you suggested a lot of additional features that are going to be really cool to implement. So what I think we're going to do, since there's so much stuff, I'm assuming there's enough stuff on there that we can go into FigJam and make a lot of visual representations, diagrams, user flows, maybe even some wireframes, and then a capabilities list. And then we can present that to you, you can give us your feedback and hopefully that kind of sets us up near the finish line since you've already articulated so much.

32:28 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, so the reason I wanted to be comprehensive was that The problem is a benefit and a curse. This sort of project, it can creep massively. There's so much opportunity to do so many other things. So it's important that we understand where the base level is. And I'm happy to get something out that works obviously that's really important to me. I want as many bells and whistles on but I'm very realistic and we need to have something that is timely let's say because if I can get this MVP out and working It can be really important as a marketing vehicle for me because I think I can get lots of usage out of it, lots of organizations potentially partnering, etc. And then obviously we can move on to the larger model while I'm doing all that. What I don't want necessarily is just something that's flashy to show people. I want something that actually works and people can sign up to and see as a finished product. So there's a balance of getting that finished product in place and not having too many bells and whistles because that will delay it. So that's the balance we need to get.

33:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, gotcha. So we'll go ahead and make those visual representations. Hasnain and I are going to be working tomorrow on the AI stuff, kind of putting on paper how we think that's going to work.

34:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'm going to finish going through the documents.

34:06 - Jonathan Phillips 
Like I say, any questions at all, however dumb they might seem, just fire away because the worst thing in the world is not knowing exactly what you need to do. So that's what my job is, to make sure that you're fully clear. So it would be helpful if you have any questions at all, just fire them over.

34:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I didn't say I have access. Oh, yeah, I have access to the right comments. So I'm gonna spam those to you.

34:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Sure, sure.

34:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. There you go, Jonas.

34:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, just to circle back to what I was going to mention earlier, quite frankly, after Kuhn set me straight in terms of my project management skills, I've been looking into it a lot, reading up on it, and watching some videos on how to get this set straight. There are a few workshops and stuff I want to get done moving forward with this project, which should hopefully help speed us up with getting it started so that we're not stuck in diagramming hell for the next five weeks.

35:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, the diagramming and analyzing, all of that stuff, hopefully get to development while we're still able to be planning some stuff, you know?

35:25 - Jonathan Phillips 
While you're still young, yeah. Yeah, while we're still young.

35:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so just some of the things that like very general things I want to get done is like a mission statement workshop, vision workshop, getting a proper roadmap established because the thing you want mentioned with like bells and whistles, I think that's all solved if you make just a general roadmap prioritized based on like what features you want, then you can just like see how long the timeline is and just cut off spending at any moment when you're happy with the features, or start it again if you want to expand with the lower priority features and all that fun stuff. So we won't have to scope up again and again and again throughout this project. And yeah, we'll be able to have a more dynamic, what's it called, specification.

36:20 - Jonathan Phillips 
Completely agree, completely agree. It's so important that we get that understanding of where we need to be because the distractions are immense because it's easy to get excited when you start to develop something both on an idea perspective from my side and on a code development from your side to start to think, oh, I can do this, and I can do it this way, and I can do it that way. And that's what really destroys the timeline. So that's something that we've, on both sides, we've got to be very patient with, and we've got to make sure that we are very focused on what we need to do.

36:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely. I'm aiming for this coming week to try to get some of those workshops going and everything. So could you share me your schedule, just so I know when you're available?

37:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I'm pretty flexible. I do have things all over the place dotted. They can be moved. So our time is down as an important time. So whatever time you have, I can try and work around it.

37:28 - Jorge Lewis 
What time do you wake up and what time do you go to sleep at?

37:35 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, so I'm available I would say from 7 a.m. Time all the way up to 11 p.m. Let's say, but it does depend on the day. I mean, I'm not saying every day, but I am quite flexible. Yeah, yeah.

37:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. Yeah, sounds good.

38:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
All right. Yeah, that's it for me. That's what I wanted to bring in.

38:07 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think, yeah, Jonas, we can just hop in a call after this and go through some things.

38:12 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sure. Thanks, guys. Great talking to you, JP.

38:16 - Jonathan Phillips 
Thanks for your time.

38:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Likewise.

38:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Take care. I'll be seeing you now. Bye-bye.""","Discussion on IP Transcript.txt"

Wed, Jul 31, 2024

0:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
here earlier, whoops. Okay, yeah, to continue on that, the goal of the application is to turn the user from wanting...

0:08 - Francisca Soto 
Wait, Jonas, Jonas, wait, wait. I want to try something. Rude.ai, this video is about the Startino team going through the BigJam specification and trying to conclude a specification that we can bring to Kuen and then finalize to bring some cost and timeline estimations to him. All right. Let's see how well that works.

0:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Fantastic.

0:31 - Francisca Soto 
Because it just seems to suck at summarization.

0:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Kuhn's vision for the application is to have it turn the user's goal from a measure of success into a long-term sustainable goal. Like, I want to establish healthy habits so that my life will be a higher quality, and I will live longer, basically. As you can see under here on the wrap-up, it says the first line, reach search shows that when people have a goal of weight loss, 95% of people put the same or more weight on within a year. We want to ensure that does not happen to you. To maximize your success, we call your goal your measure of success. This shifts from weight loss being the goal to it being how you measure success.

1:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Basically, we want them to invest in their health so that their future is better. That is the goal of how we want their mentality to be turned into.

1:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
So after a goal is ensured to be smart, it's just a pretty hard-coded explanation of just what's the purpose of this application. And then it's handed off from the coach, which is in the green text. I think it's Maria. Let me see. Yeah, it's Maria.

2:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Off onto the mentor again. Do you know the key difference between, well, for that specifically, this isn't an actual definition, but for that, do you know the key difference between a mentor and a coach?

2:22 - Francisca Soto 
I can go or Will, you can go.

2:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've already asked Will.

2:29 - Francisca Soto 
Okay. The coach, I would say, is the person that's involved in the day-to-day improving the small things, and the mentor is involved with the higher level things.

2:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
The mentor is the person that will be interacting with the clients from day to day always. And the coach is the one that's delegated to when a coaching session or a workshop needs to start. But that is just what it does. The key difference between the mentor and the coach is the coach acts more like a therapist. It tries to make the user realize something about themselves, while the mentor is giving more actionable advice. So you can see in this entire Understanding Your Why workshop, it's really just asking the user trying to come to the core reason why they're using this application, what their measures of success what their vision of the future is. It's just like a therapist asking, why, why, why? Meanwhile, a mentor is more of the person that goes, hey, you're not fucking conforming to this. You need to do this and this and this, or you're not going to achieve your vision. The coach helps you realize what your vision is and why it's important to you. The mentor helps you keep you accountable and refers back to that and tells you what to do to achieve it.

3:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it sounds like that.

3:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I hope it's apparent that I've done a lot of meetings with Kevin.

4:00 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, I remember there was one message that was similar to that as well. How he related to coach being like a therapist.

4:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. That's kind of a conclusion I came to more individually, but yeah. It doesn't surprise me that he made the same comparison. But yeah, the goal of... That's also why later on when we get to the check-ins, if the user is not conforming to the habits they've established, it gets forwarded to the coach because there's a more fundamental reason here. Reasons the person is using the application is not enough to make them conform to their habits, which means the coach needs to figure out or needs to help the user figure out more why they're even using the application, you

4:54 - Francisca Soto 
know? Yeah. So the coaches is more so like an escalation step.

4:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. It's the coach kind of establishes a baseline which the mentor works on, which is required for the mentor to be able to do its job. And when the mentor isn't able to do its job, it's likely because one of the results from coaching is incorrect now, or something has changed, or there's a new underlying thing that's blocking the user that the user needs to realize for themselves, in addition to the program to realize so that the mentor can use it for motivation. For example, this vision of the future, if the coach never asked the user to imagine their future without or with the problem being solved, the mentor would never have this thing to refer back to to keep the user accountable, right? If the user is not keeping up with his habits, the mentor will just be able to say, hey, do your habits. It's better for you. But if it knows the user wants to be able to travel more in the future, it can refer back to that. You know, guilt trip the user a bit.

6:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Pretty much that.

6:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, pretty much.

6:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, that makes sense. Will, are you there? Yeah, I'm still here.

6:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah. And then it's the wrap up. It gets handed back to the mentor again, which kind of can like, And this is all very straightforward, right? Yeah, it's just hard-coded text. And then it asks, like, do you want to sign up? Wait.

6:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think we shouldn't mention to Q1 that we're going to hard-code the wrap-up because he wants everything to be very laid-out.

6:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I have not mentioned that to him.

6:55 - Francisca Soto 
The second you mention hard, he's like, whoa, buddy, hey.

7:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm on safety only. Can't get hard anymore, bro.

7:03 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah. So we need to... Yeah, I mean, in essence, we're going to hardcode it, but of course there's an LLM that's going to be doing it. So it is dynamic. Like it's, it's dynamically hardcoded. That's a prompt. That's what a prompt is.

7:33 - Francisca Soto 
It's kind of funny, nowadays even LLMs can be considered hardcoding because their prompt is hardcoded.

7:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's just function approximation again. It's just predicting the next most probable word.

7:51 - Francisca Soto 
Literally everything is hard-coded. It's just a matter of how many...

7:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's just kind of funnily hard-coded in a way, where there are so many butterfly effects happening at the time. If you get enough butterfly effects, then it's not that dynamic.

8:13 - Francisca Soto 
Dynamic in quotations.

8:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. The only thing that's not hardcoded is the quantum level black matter specs that pop up to generate random numbers.

8:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Quantum computing, not quantum physics.

8:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Quantum physics, that's the only thing that's not hardcoded.

8:34 - Francisca Soto 
Alright, so on a high level I got it understood. So now what we want to do is A backlog or?

8:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
We want to boil this down to an outline. The outline will have features and capability requirements of those features. For example, in the introduction or in the discovering your Y workshop, there's a start button in the front. An introduction to the workshop. The capability requirements of the introduction is getting across what the point of the workshop is. Pretty basic. Handling questions from the user about the workshop, and it should identify when the user is ready to proceed. We need to basically make sure, this one is pretty straightforward, which is why I referenced it as an example. It's very easy to understand. All the ones I'm not sure are perfect. This is what we're trying to make perfect now so we can present it to Akun.

9:34 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah. So just to double check, I see the keys on top, but the gray ones are capabilities and then the blue ones are features.

9:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

9:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

9:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

9:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or use for experience points more so, or like milestones.

9:50 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, okay. And then the capabilities, can we use that as use cases for deliverables? So if we want to better track our deliverables, we can use those grey cards.

10:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's exactly the plan. So that's why I was proposing moving the Backlog to Pigtam, because then I could literally just copy-paste all these gray boxes into the Backlog. And then each of these features is a feature, and then the categories here are the epics. It's pretty easy to categorize.

10:23 - Francisca Soto 
So the to-do now is to just finish this, fill it out.

10:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that's our job for today.

10:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And probably estimate the tool rate.

10:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh yeah, estimated.

10:44 - Francisca Soto 
By the way, it's gigabyte here, $6 so let me get my laptop.

10:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
$6 gigabyte, wow. What?

10:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
You mean the internet?

10:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
His own mobile data.

11:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What kind of mobile data?

11:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
He's on Western mobile data, bro.

11:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wow. I think, I think for about two bucks, I'm getting about 18 gig already.

11:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I'm getting, uh, I'm getting 88 gigabytes every eight days for two bucks.

11:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
But Brode decided to move to, wait, are you in Mexico now or USA or Hong Kong?

11:30 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah.

11:33 - Francisca Soto 
Well, I mean, Mexico and the US are super big into provider lock-ins. You have to choose a provider. There's Telcel, and then there's AT&T. If you're not with one of those, you're paying premium prices. And if you lock into one of those, it's a three-year contract minimum.

11:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Damn.

11:56 - Francisca Soto 
That was exaggerated, but...

11:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, but still, data there is very expensive. You should live here in the Philippines.

12:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Compare anything there to the Philippines and you'll be shocked, man.

12:15 - Francisca Soto 
In Hong Kong, I was paying 10 bucks for like, I think it was 20 gigabytes. So it was a normal plan, 5G. So Hong Kong's got good prices as well.

12:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. It's a bit expensive, but I get it.

12:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Compare anything to like Thailand and the Philippines and it'll sound expensive. And you're like somewhat Western or like a progressive country.

12:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, because we have very cheap labor here. Anyways, let's proceed.

12:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Glad to have you, Erwil.

12:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Someone's joining, what's this? Chinmay, I'll admit him.

13:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I guess better timing than not.

13:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This is the best timing because we're going to be discussing the new features now, Chinmay.

13:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't know, it would have been good to get him a rundown on the high level overview. Should I run through it again quickly or should we jump right into the outline? What do you think, Jorge?

13:26 - Francisca Soto 
How about Chinmay run it through us?

13:31 - Francisca Soto 
Chinmay, you there, my guy? Come in. How are you?

13:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'm here, yeah, I'm fine. How are you?

13:38 - Francisca Soto 
Great, great. I'm doing hot. It is like 45 degrees and I'm outside because it's too loud inside. Okay, so what we'll do is we'll do a little practice session for Chinmay. Chinmay, pretend we're Kuin and JP and Arif. Those are the three people on Adapt. Pretend like we're them and explain our own product there on the screen, the FigJam. And do it within five minutes.

14:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh wow.

14:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Brutal. Is this a test?

14:15 - Francisca Soto 
No, it's a workshop. It's an exercise.

14:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like a test?

14:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, it's a test. If you fail, you get fired.

14:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, of course.

14:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
You're promoting the customer.

14:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

14:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
Did you delete my changes?

14:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, I think either, um, wait, wait, your changes. I think, did you change the workflow?

14:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
We need some version control on that.

14:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I'll help you. My changes are gone.

15:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm not sure you should roll back in virtual version history here. Like this is the current version.

15:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
What are the changes that are missing?

15:20 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, this is the discovering your why workshop, right? I created a flow for what happens after the workshop, like the onboarding for the user.

15:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
The collection graph, you mean?

15:41 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, the flow for collecting the graph, authenticating and either authenticating the user or creating a new user.

15:50 - Francisca Soto 
Oh, let's put that in here.

15:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, I did make it here. I don't know why it's not here.

15:59 - Francisca Soto 
Can someone make a clone so that we don't lose anything and we can roll back to when we had those changes?

16:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm going to view only and we'll copy over.

16:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
Where is it?

16:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you guys see the same as me when I roll back?

16:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
We can still see anything that you're doing.

16:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let us know if you've rolled back already.

16:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, I'll rather just copy over to the modern version. I won't roll back.

16:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh yeah. Fair point.

16:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:51 - Francisca Soto 
Um, yeah, just know that I'm back on Chrome or, or brave. I don't know what the actual difference is. It's much better than Firefox.

17:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I'm using Brave too. I've used Brave for a while now.

17:10 - Francisca Soto 
Just the integrations are so much better.

17:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

17:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm seeing two coaching sessions, workshops, which you made some modifications to, but it's collecting the user details. Like, did you just add some gray boxes or did you create a whole feature workload?

17:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Chinmay.

17:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. What did you ask? Can you repeat again?

17:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
It looks like you basically only added two gray boxes which say collecting user details, generating new user profile and then yeah, those two gray boxes seems to be the only...

18:09 - Chinmay Pandya 
I added more boxes which included like How do I phrase it? Taking the user through the process of the daily chatting. What is performance reviews? What are timely posting sessions?

18:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Like, what's the next process forward after onboarding? I even included that in the flow. How should the user update about his activities?

18:48 - Chinmay Pandya 
And how will his performance be assessed?

18:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
At what time of the day can he review or like how?

18:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
What day did you make this? The check-in?

19:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
I don't remember. I kept making modifications little by little each day, but I don't remember.

19:11 - Francisca Soto 
Maybe you accidentally cloned it.

19:13 - Francisca Soto 
I don't know.

19:16 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah. Maybe.

19:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe it looks at the wrong document. There's a one.

19:22 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's the exact same link, but I can create the copy. Oh, where did you post the link?

19:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
In discord, when I asked Will to review my changes.

19:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because there was, I also reduced some inconsistencies because there were duplicate entries in the boxes.

20:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Chinmay.

20:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Which file are you referring to? Maybe it's a different file. Because we have to adapt specs file, right?

20:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's what I was wondering, but I looked at the other one and it didn't have any updates. I'm looking at the last update you made, and it doesn't include the things you're mentioning.

20:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So it didn't get, oh, wait, wait. Those stuff happens though. Like sometimes you thought you saved it, but the system doesn't save it.

20:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although I'm not sure, it only happens when the internet is shaky.

20:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, I definitely created a onboarding flow and then taking the user through the daily processes flow.

21:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then you can scroll down and click on the last one by GMA. Can't you zoom out more?

21:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

21:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's like coaching something and onboarding session.

21:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I did.

21:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
I made changes in the onboarding. Is it this?

21:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, I'm going to send the screenshot. The other one. We can see your stream.

21:52 - Chinmay Pandya 
The one right, the one right side.

21:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here? Yeah. Is it this? Yeah.

21:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
But where is, where is post-workshop flow? I also add that.

22:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Uh, how do you search here?

22:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
There was a box between workshop core and session. No, sorry, not the between, like after this session wrap up.

22:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
There is no change by you after July 29 that I can find.

22:27 - Chinmay Pandya 
The fuck?

22:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
You're going back in time, Will.

22:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I misread my name to Chinmay's.

22:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think this could be a...

22:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, you guys should add like profile icons to your accounts by the way, so that it's easier to recognize.

22:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, there isn't any change after this one.

23:06 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think we're, I can't read what, uh, what is the text in the boxes under workshop core? Can you read them out?

23:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Text under workshop core, collecting user details, generating user profile.

23:23 - Chinmay Pandya 
I deleted the user's goals, measure of success. I deleted this. It should not be.

23:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm.

23:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I think we will be wasting a little bit of time here because we're going to be identifying what was in the past and what was not. So my suggestion to speed things up, how about we run through the current features now and then provide us with your insights, Xinmei, as to what you have included. So basically, we layer on what we currently have now.

24:04 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, OK.

24:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jorge, are you back by the way?

24:07 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, I'm just chilling here. Yeah, OK. Doing some Read.AI sales.

24:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you figure out the mobile or how to reduce costs or whatever?

24:20 - Francisca Soto 
I'm just hoping fake gem just doesn't take up all my data.

24:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
It would more be watching the stream, I think.

24:28 - Francisca Soto 
Well, that's why I'm using my grandma's phone because I'm using her SIM card for her. But she doesn't have hospital on her phone. So I'm using my data from my laptop.

24:39 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah.

24:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Okay. So I'll let you take the lead again, Jonas.

24:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
It should be Chen Mei. If Chen Mei is doing the presentation that Jorge talked about.

24:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, I was thinking.

25:03 - Francisca Soto 
I think it's a great exercise.

25:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm very great at presentations.

25:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No worries.

25:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jorge, should he be presenting the example or the almost exclusively me and Will have been making?

25:23 - Francisca Soto 
Maybe the outline as in like this here.

25:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because that's not the features and capability requirements or the conversation history.

25:31 - Francisca Soto 
Like, like, like what we just went through before, like the whole kind of concept.

25:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Uh, tell me, you shouldn't be going through the part you're looking at now. You should be going through the whole other parts, the whole day example, basically.

25:48 - Chinmay Pandya 
So the big vertical flow chart. Yeah.

25:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

25:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
So just what is the point of the discovering your why workshop?

26:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
What do you mean?

26:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
What do I have to present right now? Oh, no, like just discover your why workshop.

26:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, the goal of you presenting, if I remember correctly, is an exercise for you on how to present the flowchart to the user. So yeah. Basically, I think if I get Jorge's intentions right, he wants you to present the user flow in a way you understand it so that it serves as a practice for your communication skills as well. And to know how much you understood of the program.

26:49 - Francisca Soto 
Perfect.

26:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
So just give me two days?

26:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay, fine. We'll wait.

27:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
There's a kind of a main thing behind the program to understand.

27:16 - Francisca Soto 
Well, I guess I'd be fair. Do you understand the main idea of the project?

27:21 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah.

27:23 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah. Okay.

27:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we've been kind of out of sync. Oh, yeah, I haven't mentioned to you at all. I just kind of mentioned to everyone in the call, which I haven't been able to do. Moving forward, I'll usually be like online between, like... Okay, I should be doing it a little bit more.

27:54 - Francisca Soto 
I think just general times.

28:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
So like around this time I'll be available to call and everything, probably an hour before now, but otherwise I'll be shifting my morning schedule more forward because no one else is on them anyways and adding two hours in the midnight for me to 2 a.m. For me so I should be able to sync up a lot more with you Jimmy and get you more aligned in the program on the because lately it's been hard communicating with you and getting us aligned when we've just been talking on text pretty asynchronously.

28:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
We haven't been able to go back and forth much.

28:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, like, I'm... Mostly because my academics are from morning to evening, so...

28:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

28:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, for meetings, I like, after 9.30... 9.30 12, 12.30, whenever you call me.

29:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

29:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Bro, I wish the shisha place was open from midnight till today.

29:10 - Francisca Soto 
Bro, my new phone... My new phone, the X, is overheated. That's how hot it is right now.

29:20 - Chinmay Pandya 
And it's like, here we are, phone.

29:33 - Chinmay Pandya 
Whenever you're ready. Yeah, that's what I was saying.

29:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
Is it okay if I explain the flow piece by piece? I'm not good at remembering the entire flow at once.

29:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
You should give like more of a high-level overview and then dig into the specifics more and more over time. You shouldn't be going into specifics to start off with and you certainly shouldn't just be reiterating what's in the flow. You should be more explaining the concept behind it.

30:09 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'll just read the flow and explain the high-level stuff as I understand it.

30:16 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, one tip is just try not to read from the the cards, since that's usually seen as not very efficient, nor is it very impressive on our side of view.

30:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've reiterated this with Zanin quite a few times lately with the IntelliAgent video he's been making. Basically, when you're presenting, when you're explaining stuff by voice while also showing a graphic on your screen, the graphic on your screen is usually showing how you're doing something, but what you should be saying with your voice is why you're doing it, what it's trying to achieve. So you should be explaining what you're trying to achieve while the graphic is showing how it's achieved.

31:02 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, when I go about like the diagrams usually that have like quite a bit of content I only use them as talking points and I try like I really don't even look at my screen when I'm speaking I'm more just going off of my imagination and what I understand the project to be since that's what they want to they wants to know like how you perceive the project and It feels a lot more natural to them And if you're unsure about some part say just like just you can hit the line, correct me if I'm wrong, and then give your interpretation of whatever you might be worried might be wrong.

31:37 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. So I should not explain the flow, but why the flow is created, right?

31:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that's correct. I'll mention it and I notice that like the interpretation is wrong, but yeah, that sounds correct.

31:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. Okay. So I'll try. Let me start with, uh, I think I can skip the introductions. Yeah. Yeah.

32:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
So users can, uh, use this application in either two ways. I think that's not necessary either.

32:28 - Francisca Soto 
Just don't worry, don't worry too much. Just feel natural. Just kind of like, all right, yeah, let's go through this. Yeah, okay.

32:37 - Chinmay Pandya 
So there's two ways in which a user can use the ADAPT program, either by a website or a mobile application, which can be discovered when the user signs up for a newsletter, or he can be referenced to by someone else.

32:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Right now, you're explaining what it's doing, not why it's doing this. Just like a note.

33:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
There is no why in website and mobile.

33:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
The why is this diagram explains how the user comes to discover the application and the workshop. That's what this diagram is outlining. We didn't need to go into each card.

33:26 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay, so what should I have said?

33:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
For me, when I presented this to Jorge for this entire discovery section, I just said, okay, so yeah, this just shows everything before they even start using the application. So that's not much for us to worry about, but yeah, it shows how they come to know of the application, what the process is. That doesn't even touch upon a single card in this diagram. It's just explaining why this exists.

33:57 - Francisca Soto 
So think of it like this. Your goal for this is to tell us what this project is going to do. The whole onboarding day, what it looks like, Use the diagram only when necessary. Ideally, you're not even using it on the problem. You can close your eyes and just think alright So I know that there's gonna be two ways that you just can interact is that there's an after this website But first gonna you know, we can also use it We're gonna use the onboarding or the understanding or why is a lead magnet just kind of going off your memory and it's okay if you say And wait like five seconds between going on to your next point since that shows

34:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
more that you're actually thinking rather than going off of a diagram Yeah Got it Okay, so the first diagram, I think it shows how users can be aware of this program and they can use that either using a website or a mobile application.

35:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
The first thing which happens when the user logs in is a discovering your why workshop. This workshop intends to reason with the user on why he is signing up for the program, what are his goals, what are his motivation behind certain changes that he wants to make in his life and try to really understand the deeper psychological aspects of his life, which affect his current situation and why he wants to make it better. So this is a workshop where, yeah, Was it good?

36:08 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, that was good. That's exactly what Khun wants to hear. Your side of things, but put in his kind of format.

36:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I didn't look at the graph at all. I thought I was saying something wrong.

36:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
You should start every presentation at the absolute highest of levels. Not at the start, but at the highest of levels looking at everything exactly like you did. You just explained the entire graph kind of just haphazardly in a high-level perspective. You should always do that and explain kind of the purpose of what you're going to be explaining before delving into any specifics at all.

36:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, in order.

36:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, continuing my presentation, the workshop starts with a brief introduction. And the user will be asked about his goals and why has he signed up for this program the goals can be general goals like maybe somebody wants to lose weight maybe somebody's going through diabetes maybe somebody wants to gain weight so there are there can be different sets of goals but every set of goal has a measure of success and why they want to implement that into their lifestyle. So, the reason behind this workshop is to get to that detailed reason and the change that they want to inhabit in their lifestyle and how would their lifestyle change after they achieve that particular goal. And the other factor for this workshop is also to really understand the motivating factor for the user.

38:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
Which the user can be reminded and held like the user can be held accountable for. Yeah, just, you know, everybody needs a small reminder when they're not performing well. Everybody needs to know why they started. So this workshop, uh, does two things. It defines your measures of success, your goals. And it also kind of, uh, tries to find out the remember why you started thing for the users. Because the most important thing for any activity is not the details, but consistency. Even if you're lacking in some things, but if you're being consistent, it does show results. So that's why the reason why you started is really important.

39:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
For an example, if a user says I want to lose weight, there can be multiple reasons. One of the reasons is like maybe he wants to, like maybe he wants to just look better or maybe he wants to better fit into his clothes. Maybe he has been bullied for being overweight before. There can be multiple reasons for a user's past.

39:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
This process makes sure to create a connection with the user to understand his situation and be I don't know how to, like, I'm lost here. I don't know how to start.

39:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I will say absolutely great. Like, you've nailed this so far. Like, the improvement now you've been, like, going about presenting this has been amazing. What do you think, Jorge?

40:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, thanks.

40:12 - Francisca Soto 
Exactly. Yeah. And if you go on a tangent, if you go on a tangent where you're kind of lost for words, so, like, you say N, and then you have no clue kind of what to say after that, you just say, yeah, just, yeah. Just say, yeah, and then you go, but in your case, this specifically, it's not important, but you could just say, yeah, it's to go deeper. Then I just move on. You can say something arbitrary and they won't really notice.

40:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because I think I said everything that I had in mind about this workshop. So I didn't know what to say anymore. Yeah.

40:45 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah. Oh, well, I mean, you could go into the, you continue following along with the graph and just going into the, the smart goals, just mentioning how that's an aspect of how we want to make sure that the goals they set, we want them to be...

40:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
From what I'm hearing, you're mostly aligned with the vision of the project from at least a high level of perspective. I could probably run you through basically what I ran Jorge through earlier, just as an entire graph in my way, but a fair bit faster since you already have quite a grasp of how it's working. What do you think, Jorge?

41:20 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, I mean, I think he's touched on everything. Just the last thing I want to hear him and he can practice a little bit more is the smart goals and then the wrap-up. So, in a minute, he can go through all those.

41:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, okay. I'll take some, like, a few minutes to prepare, I think.

41:45 - Francisca Soto 
No, no, no. Don't prepare. Don't prepare. Just go straight into it.

41:47 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, just scroll down to the smart goals ensure measure success down there and just kind of explain like what's yeah okay so this workshop the one of the main goals for this workshop is to get smart measures of success for user what do I mean when I say smart this workshop tends to be realistic with the user and it tends to get goals which can be measured in time which can be time bound which has a certain deadline and which can be measured with like which can be measured quantifiably. Like if you want to lose weight, we ask, how much weight do you want to lose?

42:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you're going a bit too specific now, like, yeah, you haven't explained what the purpose of this is yet. Like why you're going into these details.

42:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just try again. There's no problem.

42:58 - Francisca Soto 
So what does smart goals help with?

43:01 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think it helps the user to be more clear about his goals.

43:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

43:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
So the smart goals are the goals, which are time bound. No, sorry. That's again, the details. Okay. Okay. So One of the main goals for this workshop is to get SMART measures of success for the users in order to clarify his visions of success. And SMART goals, basically what they do is they give a sense of achievement to the user, clarity and a roadmap for the user on what can be done, what is feasible, what can be achieved and like a vision of a future achievement.

43:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
So smart goals To summarize, smart goals actually give the user on what he's going to be able to do in the coming future. What changes will he have made? How far will he have grown and how better will he have become?

44:34 - Francisca Soto 
I think going into the details would be okay. I was following you, I don't know what's on your screen, but I was seeing the visualize the future. I think you're also on there, right?

44:47 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, but I'm not looking at it.

44:49 - Francisca Soto 
So it's great that you're going off the top of your head, that's perfect. But use the resources, which we have here, the black card, which lists some of the things. And Jonas, I think it would actually be okay if you mentioned some of the things. All I would do is be like, yeah, one of the aspects is we want to make sure the goals are smart. So we want to make sure that they're very specific. We have some numbers, if we want to lose weight, how much weight and how much time. Those are things that help the user have a very clear roadmap in terms of achieving their goals. It's a proven framework to make goals more achievable.

45:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
One of the main factors of smart goals is also to give the user a realistic approach to whatever he wants to achieve.

45:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I want to touch on that, Jorge. I was more commenting on that he immediately started with the details, so Jonas, it's okay to dive into the details, but you have to give an overview first of explaining why you're going over something.

45:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Also, the second time when you started to explain explaining the smart goals, you noticed it yourself, but you basically just immediately dived into time bound. What does that mean? But instead, you went into giving general overview. The overview was great. And after you've given that great overview, then you can dive more into the specifics. And the people that are listening will actually understand what you're talking about.

46:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
Got it. So I think if I had looked at the flow and like, you know, I had prepared like before the presentation, if I had prepared a page for it, then maybe I would have been, I would have been explained it.

46:33 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah. I think not having that page of preparation is exactly what we're trying to do though.

46:40 - Francisca Soto 
Since if you have a page of preparation, I think we'll be able to tell. I think we'll be able to tell. You want it slower, which is fine.

46:46 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, I'm not expecting from the page of preparation, but at least I'll be know which points I need to cover. Just that.

46:55 - Francisca Soto 
I don't know. Jonas, for you, how do you like to work? Because for me, for example, if I've looked at this graph twice and I understand it, I don't want anything else because then it'll kind of steer me like it'll It gives me too much restriction. I'd rather just go through it and explain the thought process, like how I did for the smart goals. One important thing is to make sure the goals are smart, making them achievable.

47:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Before I answer that, could I ask you, what did you think of my presentation to you of the general example graph that I went over earlier?

47:27 - Francisca Soto 
The only thing that I would improve is making a little bit faster pace. Sometimes when you go slow and you went into a couple of examples, which is good, but I think we stayed on those examples for too long, the flow was kind of lost.

47:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
For that whole presentation, I basically just used my understanding of the project and intuitive sense that I've gotten over the past few weeks now of how to present something properly, and just kind of winged it, just explained each part how I saw best fits. It's an important skill to have to intuitively understand how much detail to go into at what stage, which parts you should be explaining, when you should be explaining the why compared to the what. So, for example, why is it doing it compared to what is are doing. These are things you need to know intuitively. And when you know them intuitively through doing ad hoc presentations like this and getting key feedback, you can make much better planned presentations. If you want to plan your presentation, you should have this intuitive sense.

48:39 - Francisca Soto 
I had one friend that would, like literally every second sentence, he would say, I diverge.

48:47 - Francisca Soto 
So for example, If you're going, if I'm starting off like, okay, so discovery, there's two ways that the user can become made aware of The first one is the website. Website, there's gonna be a newsletter. Okay, sorry, I diverge. There's just two ways that the user can use the app, and that's how they get on board. They start with the understanding your why workshop, and then you go. So if you go too far into details, you just say, I diverge, or anyways, just kind of going back, it's, Understanding you went too deep is a great skill as well. Like you did when you said tie-bound, and then you're like, oh, wait, that's too specific. So when you start off, you just say, oh, wait, actually, and then just start again.

49:30 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, so it was great awareness that you corrected yourself there already. So progress. The explanation for me, the understanding your why workshop was great. He was explaining exactly why we were doing that workshop.

49:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I think I had some repetitive points.

49:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
had like fundamentally understood what how you should be presenting it it's just more I think a lack of uh delving into the capable like the requirements of the projects that like i've just been way more meetings about it's uh been funking over it a lot more so I have more context to build off of but if I had your context I would probably be in the same position yeah with practice it'll it'll be great yeah Yeah, thanks, thanks

50:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
for making me doing this.

50:28 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, no problem.

50:30 - Francisca Soto 
One thing, this isn't, this isn't in specific, this is just kind of in general. One thing I've noticed, I don't know if it, I think it's technical people. Or, I don't know, I've just noticed that I think it's maybe more so when they're under any sort of pressure is they start to ramble way too much. Like for example, I'm talking to a video editor and He and we got into a meeting and he went on he was able to go on for an hour Rambling like it was it was pointless ramble. Like he was explaining the YouTube algorithm and He and I knew he was rambled because he felt he feels like he had the need to keep talking like he would say yeah, so Talking more of this aspect, like it was very clear that he was trying to... He felt the need to speak about something, whereas sometimes you just don't need to.

51:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

51:28 - Francisca Soto 
So... Something like that? Oh, sorry? Did I do something like that?

51:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, no, no.

51:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the fundamental aspect I've realized is there's such a clear difference between explaining why compared to what you're doing. So if I have planned a technical implementation for a program that I'm about to develop for a client, when I'm talking with the client, I only explain what I'm trying to achieve, not how I'm achieving it. If that makes sense. It should be up to them to trust us on the technical implementation. What we're doing to achieve it, how we're achieving it, that's up to us. What we're trying to achieve and why we're achieving it, that's what we have to align with them on.

52:27 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, and to kind of expand on that, that's not to say we don't need to go into technical things. For example, the reverse supervisor or the subvisor architecture, we can explain that in a way where we're explaining why we're doing it. So we're doing this because by doing them all, by having all the agents respond to every message, we can make it so that we get all of their input and none of their input is disregarded. For example, if we, and this, I'm pretending I'm talking to Chinmay, and I'd explain kind of, using metaphors is great, or like analogies, so like, oh yeah, imagine we're in a room. The subvisor design is a way for everyone to speak without anyone kind of speaking over each other. Sorry, I didn't explain that very well, by the way. Now I'm very clearly rambling. I don't know if you guys can...

53:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's probably, I'd just say, so what we're trying to achieve with this graph is we're trying to achieve an atmosphere where anyone can speak up at any moment, where they have the most relevant information to say.

53:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's what it's trying to achieve. I haven't said anything about how it's achieving it. I can then go afterwards, after explaining what it's trying to achieve, I can go into elaborate with how it's achieving it, which is having every agent speak at once and then having the subvisor pick out who can speak. Who said the most relevant thing. But what our client cares most about, at least in the introduction, the introduction may fascinate them enough to inquire about how it's done, but the introduction needs to be what it's trying to achieve, not how it's trying to achieve

54:06 - Francisca Soto 
it. The end-to-end user experience.

54:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

54:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'd like to get this moving along though with the outline because it's currently 2 a.m.

54:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
for me or like about to be so yeah and I'd like to have my beauty sleep sometime soon yeah I also have to get to bed yeah I need to wake up at 6.30 or 7 I guess In the evening, there's just too many people who come to the gym. I don't know why they come to the gym.

54:56 - Francisca Soto 
In the evening? Yeah.

54:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
In my hostel, the gym is open in the morning and in the evening.

55:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sounds like everyone wants to get moving forward. Shall we get started?

55:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so we have the outline then that we're trying to derive from the whole example that we have, basically separated into three parts for now. We may separate it more into like, or the understanding your why into more, but basically just introduction and the wrap up and the core, the mentor wrap-up and the mentor introduction to be specific. Inside the Discovering Your Why, there's the coach introduction and coach wrap-up too, which have kind of similar points. I don't know if we should be including these perfectly similar points, but yeah, that should be able to basically be copied over as far as I know. Sorry, now I'm diverging into specific stuff, just like I've been talking.

56:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, we need to go over this general thing, get it all sorted out so that it's ready to present to Kuhn. And what do you think, Jorge? Should we have it estimated today? That's kind of what we told him we would have.

56:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, his Tuesday... Or what I told him. Tomorrow we'll be trying to get the design spec and estimations finalized and ready. Yeah, and estimation.

56:31 - Francisca Soto 
Will, if we have it done by Wednesday, by his Wednesday morning, we should be fine, which means you guys all have tomorrow morning until afternoon to finish it, right?

56:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
For just the afternoon, it's like around when everyone comes online, so.

56:51 - Francisca Soto 
Will, are you working tomorrow morning?

56:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm not sure if I'm going to wake up tomorrow morning because it's late already.

56:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's 3am for Will and 2am for me. I'm guessing midnight for Chinmay.

57:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, but...

57:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, 1234.

57:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If ever, I'll probably still provide my estimations tonight. You can just add up what I think.

57:21 - Francisca Soto 
Kun wakes up at, like, we just need to have it done by midday his time. So that's 7, wait what? Yeah, that's like 7 p.m. For you guys. So we definitely have enough time.

57:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, we can do it post meeting. Go on, sorry.

57:42 - Francisca Soto 
Let's try to get it done by 5 p.m. In Thailand time. So 6 p.m. Philippines time and...

58:01 - Francisca Soto 
3pm, yeah, India. 3.30

58:08 - Francisca Soto 
I'm going to have a great skill of converting time zones.

58:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Me and you both. I was just waiting for you to say quite a 3.30 while there. What we're missing here is any of the discovery, like how they download the app and all that. We're kind of just jumping directly into the introduction by the agents. So if there's any, we need to figure out if there's anything we need to estimate before that. Otherwise, after the mentors wrap up, we need to also introduce another section, which is the payment and the whole onboarding, uh, onboarding session. Uh, and by onboarding, I mean, the like collection graph.

58:51 - Francisca Soto 
Right. By the way, Stripe uses, um, accepts Apple pay and Google pay.

58:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Nice. Oh, okay.

58:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's nice.

59:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Oh, bro. Implemented in this version of the program.

59:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Who's mouse should I follow, by the way, for the screen record?

59:14 - Francisca Soto 
Uh, just hang on the outline, I guess you could probably zoom out on the whole thing. Yesterday, when I was like about to sleep, I saw a message, something saying like, if we have user, oh, here it is. If we have user auth in a paywall in the depth, why would we not lift it? We need to make sure we reuse the common elements. That alone. I was, it was very frustrating because yes, we've done it already many times. We know how to do it. It's not, we're not, we're not innovating here, but it's like a, it's like an interconnected web, all the user often payment integration. So all the unique edge cases and things. So it's just, yeah, we're lifting our experience and knowledge, which should make it as efficient as we can. But those assumptions need to be the, um, Yeah, because now because if we say oh, it's gonna take realistically user often and payment integration will take at least a week I think Just like kind of at least but for him. He's I'm very certain. He's gonna ask why on earth Is this gonna take a week when we've done it? When we've gonna when we've already done it for a death or like for example if I'm coding for intelligent, so Those are the times which I don't shouldn't be you in there But this is those are the times where we just need to talk I'm gonna tell them Hey, we're not here to explain to you how we do things. We're going to do things as efficiently as we can, of course, and you're going to have to trust us on those. I don't want to explain why I have to integrate a super-based authentication here and here.

1:00:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I mean, I think, I don't know why, I don't know what to answer to this, but definitely, even if you're doing the exact same thing for another project, but it is another project, so you will charge according to another project.

1:01:01 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, I'll be overhead and just... It's learning and placing is like...

1:01:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
With saying something like that, we're not just charging it because it's another project. We want to be the most efficient developers out there. If we can spend all our time on just business logic instead of all this like... If we could just click a button to implement Authentication. We wouldn't charge for it because that gave us a big like lead in terms of just development Like we could sell ourselves on that like we we want to be developing the exciting stuff We don't want to be developing the boring stuff. We're charging him for the boring stuff because it takes time Yeah, exactly.

1:01:38 - Francisca Soto 
It's just realistically like it does take time It's like trying to transplant a heart and saying just put it like it's a safe heart We're just trying to move a heart like it's not that hard It's kind of dangerous

1:01:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
with the screenshots that he sent me from your DMs. I don't know if you remember them, but it's the... Where did I send it?

1:02:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think he doesn't know that even if you use the same logic, but you still need to design a different graph with different mentors and different prompts. And to test that it takes time, especially for a framework which has not been out there even for a year.

1:02:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
He says, I want to ensure the work product is reusable for Intelligent. The workshop capabilities are very similar. If you feel differently, I need that explained. That last sentence is like the one that me and Jorge, I think, I think we agree. That's the one we have the biggest issue with.

1:02:48 - Francisca Soto 
You don't need anything explained, mister.

1:02:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Respectfully, of course.

1:02:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
You were going to address it in the call we were going to do with Kuhn, and then Kuhn's internet went bye-bye. And then he went to his ice bath, so no more meeting with Kuhn. We had a much nicer meeting with Kuhn.

1:03:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
You know what we say in India when somebody does the same thing when they're asking for something?

1:03:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

1:03:22 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's like if somebody is trying to, you know, tell you how to do your job or something like that. Like we say, it means that if you know already so much, why don't you do it yourself?

1:03:45 - Francisca Soto 
That's exactly what my friends say, like when we're playing football and we make fun of them for messing up a shot, they say exactly that. I can't even say it though, I've tried many times.

1:03:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nice.

1:03:59 - Francisca Soto 
How do you suppose we won't hold you up on that, Jorge?

1:04:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because we still haven't clarified that with him to the point where we can... Would, like, everyone can say it. We haven't had the arguments that I'm expecting us in front of us in the previous call that we were in the middle of

1:04:18 - Francisca Soto 
Well, I mean, it shouldn't be much of an argument. It should be me saying, Chinmay, you have to trust us. Because I'm not going to explain it to you. Like, I... I'm not going to explain how I do what I do, I'm going to tell you why I'm doing things. And why I'm doing things is, I'm trying to save you money. That's the why. How I do that, that doesn't matter. To explain to you every little thing how I'm doing that, that's going to take way too long. And, you know, your time is very valuable, so is mine, so I'm going to respect that.

1:04:52 - Francisca Soto 
he can't say much, like, anything he says to that, I'm just gonna circle back to the main point of, no, I'm not going to explain it, like, if you want more updates, that's okay, if you want, like, we can do more updates, that's perfectly fine, but I'm not going to explain to you before we're even getting started why we can't do this thing.

1:05:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, because we're not responsible for making reusable features, right?

1:05:17 - Francisca Soto 
To make what? We're not making reusable features, like, Yeah, if we were designing our things to be used in multiple projects, this would be a totally different story, but we're trying to just look in place, which is faster and cheaper than trying to design it to be reusable.

1:05:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:05:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's dangerous talking about creating like, uh, or like, I mean, in front of Kuhn saying like, we're not trying to make it reusable because he'll just say like, why this should be reusable.

1:05:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
Uh, because reusable things are pricely. The one, the one time things are cheap because the fact that you can use it again and you do not need to, you know, reusable thing twice as expensive. Yeah.

1:06:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it is, but will he believe that?

1:06:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
But then we come back to the fundamental point again, he shouldn't need to believe that, that's what we tell him.

1:06:24 - Francisca Soto 
He doesn't need to believe anything other than trusting us, hence he should believe everything because of course if we tell him, hey buddy, it's going to cost you 50 grand, then of course that's a but We're charging very little like these are like these are one of our first kind of official AI projects So we're giving him extreme if he went to any other agency like to build these apps He would be at least a multiple app at least three. I think of the total cost So he's already getting a great price and I would say the best experience like the other guys would probably Be terrible to work with in my like from what I've heard This is our first time in our Like all the product management things but like in just because we haven't we're great people and like we're a new agency We don't have all that that baggage that all those other agencies have Let's decide this So What what's left of this outline? To add more features or do we have to add estimates? What our timelines are?

1:07:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Oh Can you elaborate on that? Guiding the user through the daily processes. What are the daily processes? And what is a check-in? I think the user needs to be...

1:07:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
That doesn't sound like it should be part of the current scope.

1:08:08 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, that's important because we're going to build that and Kuhn has been asking for like a high-level thing and if you ask us, okay, because we've been so focused on this as soon as like the other ports are still very relevant like we can we have to make sure those are included.

1:08:26 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so just providing the user the awareness about the daily updates and the check-in, what is a check-in?

1:08:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
This should realistically be the same graph as introduction wrap-ups, right?

1:08:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because it's more of an explainer. Like, we can make this like a more general graph, the explainer graph, which explains something, then answer the question until the user is ready to proceed.

1:08:56 - Francisca Soto 
Wait, so you're talking about like, as in explaining to the user the rest of the app?

1:09:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, like after the onboarding, how we can use the app and what is a check-in. Specifically, what is a check-in?

1:09:12 - Francisca Soto 
I don't think that's... We can ask Kun about that. We can include it if we want. But I was kind of more referring to the rest of the app.

1:09:22 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that's what I mean. The check-in, end-of-the-day check-in, chatting graph, analyzer. This is the rest of the app, right?

1:09:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
So it's not just...

1:09:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. But the reason why they like the thought process behind is that, you know, whenever you, whenever you're using an LLM, your query prompts, if they are, you know, designed or asked in a particular way, it gives better outputs. So if we provide a guide or a manual to the user, not a long manual, maybe two to three to four lines of a guide to the user, maybe he can use the app better. Because even when you're using chat GPT, you need to enter better programs.

1:10:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Where do you want this guide? The explanation you just gave was almost purely how, no why we're doing what you're explaining.

1:10:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so this happens after the discovering your why workshop, right?

1:10:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, now you're explaining how it happens. It happens after discovering your why. Why is it happening?

1:10:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so the why is it happening is just to provide the user, to provide him with what prompts he can use to interact, like, with the LLM.

1:10:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Do we need that to be part of the current scope?

1:10:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
I don't know what the current scope is.

1:10:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
The current scope we're trying to focus down on is establishing the first day onboarding basically completely.

1:11:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. So it's not the rest of the app, but it's awareness about the rest of the app and how the user can have, be aware about different roms. Like it's a one-time thing. So it needs to happen after onboarding post-onboarding.

1:11:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
This sounds like it could be part of like the wrap up in the yellow hair has bottom.

1:11:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. Yeah. Like, uh, post onboarding, post wrap up.

1:11:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
post wrap, post sign up. Sign up happens after the year Y workshop and after the year Y workshop is summarized or like wrapped up.

1:11:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
So the user opens the app. They're introduced to the app. They're handed over to the coach, which runs the ROI workshop. After the workshop is done, it's handed back to the mentor, which concludes it, wraps it up, and asks the user to sign up for the application. After which point, the user will sign up, pay for the application, and then be taken into the core of the application.

1:12:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'm assuming when they're taken into the core of the application is when you mean This, I mean, after the payment request, this, this needs to happen after the user has paid for the program.

1:12:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. So what do you think Jorge?

1:12:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is something completely new, which we haven't talked with Kuhn about implementing in this iteration at all. I don't think we're at the stage today when we're supposed to be delivering the outline that we want to be adding more stuff to the outline.

1:13:01 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, no, I mean, this feature is, you know, just three texts. It doesn't require human interaction at all.

1:13:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
These can be just the LLM providing like prompt examples or chat interaction examples.

1:13:25 - Francisca Soto 
That's a small task that we can kind of put on paper and see later. But right now I want to figure out what's the scope. So after the payment is made, Yeah, what are we? We're tasked with building the rest of the app. I'm pretty sure that otherwise he has this this lead magnet they sign up and then they pay for nothing like It's great that he's he's using this as a lead magnet now, and it's a great onboarding cool, but He still wants the rest of the app and we've made some half of the rest of the app, but the other rest the app is Missing so we and we don't have the I missed was maintenance diagram of the rest

1:14:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
of that after this current iteration or during the current iteration so that we get a more holistic view of the rest of the app and a similar way into how we've done for this onboarding day. The reason we're doing the onboarding day first is because it's a lot more specific and measurable. It's also has a very clear end goal, like compared to the rest of the app, which is more arbitrary, it'll change from day to day and it's a lot longer lasting, which means it's harder to define. But it'll be easier to define once we have the onboarding stuff that we've outlined here down in PayPay.

1:14:46 - Francisca Soto 
Which we do.

1:14:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, okay, sorry, down in code.

1:14:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
On code. Don't you think that...

1:14:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or do you want to halt the estimations and continue with planning the rest of the application?

1:15:03 - Francisca Soto 
There's a middle ground, which is sending this to him, sending the onboarding date back to him, getting his feedback on that, and make the specification for the rest of the app. I don't think Chinmay wants to have a question mark.

1:15:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
The specification for the rest of the app will take more time.

1:15:29 - Francisca Soto 
We have four people on this. I don't think a lot more time like we meetings with him vision alignments and the rest of the

1:15:38 - Francisca Soto 
Well, we can get started on this while we're doing that then. But the biggest thing is that he doesn't want a big question mark on the rest of the app in terms of price, which it is. He, he has no clue what he's going to be paying for the rest of the app since we, since no one has a clue what it is, the rest of the app is.

1:15:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
The only, like, the proper way to solve that is taking another week to the vision alignment and all of that on the rest of the app, and then properly diagramming it up like we have now with the current one.

1:16:10 - Francisca Soto 
That's the way to... Don't we have a good idea on the rest of the app though? Like, the rest of the app is the original concept of the app.

1:16:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Kind of, but not really now, considering he's changed the vision of the rest of the game.

1:16:34 - Francisca Soto 
interpretation is going to be a great head start and it shouldn't take long it's just putting what we already know and then he can insert different things here and there which is the time-consuming part.

1:16:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah that's the thing if we insert that now I think he's gonna be quite like he's gonna have even more stuff that he's able to disagree with which will slow us down even more.

1:16:56 - Francisca Soto 
But it's it's not about slowing us down because we're we're gonna like it's just we can't move forward without knowing the rest of the app like it's It's like building a... Sorry?

1:17:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
That will slow it down.

1:17:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

1:17:14 - Francisca Soto 
It'll slow... It'll slow it down, but...

1:17:22 - Francisca Soto 
We have to know what the rest of the app is. Like, we can't build this first part and not know what the rest of the app is.

1:17:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think without designing the... At least either the awareness or the rest of the app is going to question what we were doing all this time.

1:17:37 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, exactly. There's definitely a big worry in case if we don't, like if we only have this onboarding workshop, it's a big worry. There's a lot of reasons. I think you could probably see them.

1:17:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
I know, but we don't have infinite time to continue with this diagramming and speculating and meetings.

1:17:57 - Francisca Soto 
We're going to be doing it in parallel while waiting for his response for this one. So we finish this onboarding day outline and we say, hey, here's this onboarding outline. Hopefully everything looks good. In the meantime, we're going to be migrating or we're going to be putting on paper in the same format the rest of the year. We're going to send that to you tomorrow or the day after of whatever we send this day.

1:18:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Do you expect them to agree with that estimation that we send them?

1:18:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
estimation like, uh, or with the spec that we send them for the rest of the application, because I very easily foresee that taking several weeks of vision alignment and meetings before we're aligned.

1:18:40 - Francisca Soto 
We don't, we don't need to, we don't need to agree to a T. The idea is that, okay, is the main idea of the app within kind of what we've put here. And he's going to say, not really. And I'm going to say, okay, are these blue cards correct? Is, are these the things you want? And he's going to say, yes. So then we're going to say, OK, so the price range is within this and this. So at least we have something on paper. We have something to go off of, rather than we need a coaching session, we need check-ins, we want to chat with the user. So we don't need to go very detailed. It's something on paper that he knows, OK, the price range is within here. We can go into detail while we build the onboarding stuff. So we're not really wasting, like, We're not wasting time, Nico.

1:19:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
So this is a plan for after we send it tomorrow.

1:19:39 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, so we send it to them and say, here's the onboarding day spec, take a look, hopefully all is aligned, and that includes the estimations and stuff.

1:19:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
This discussion shouldn't change what we're working on today, so I think we should just move forward with finishing up. What we need to do today.

1:20:00 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, well, I mean, we needed to discuss all that to figure out the actual plan, though.

1:20:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
So if the plan is good, yeah.

1:20:09 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, so we got all the fun then.

1:20:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, yeah, like even if it's a yes or no to that, it doesn't change what we're doing today. So we'll just move forward with what we're doing today.

1:20:21 - Francisca Soto 
Well, I mean, today we don't need to finish this today. We have all of tomorrow. Like all of today. Will you be on tomorrow?

1:20:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like during the time we're on?

1:20:32 - Francisca Soto 
I'm taking a look at it like these things now. What's my value? Like what's my input into the system here?

1:20:47 - Francisca Soto 
What do you mean?

1:20:49 - Francisca Soto 
Like, what am I, what am I going to be contributing to it? In what way?

1:20:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Making sure it's aligned up, like with what you'd think Kuen would expect out of an outline spec. Just giving your general input value at, like helping finish up the spec in a nice way.

1:21:11 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah.

1:21:23 - Francisca Soto 
for time. Those are two things. I think those all can be done async.

1:21:33 - Francisca Soto 
For all the cards on paper, I can put it onto this one version we have here. And then for the estimates, so that you guys don't get biased. What was that?

1:21:46 - Francisca Soto 
Hello? Yeah.

1:21:49 - Francisca Soto 
Did someone join? Really?

1:22:01 - Francisca Soto 
So we'll do both the estimating and finalizing the cards can be done async. I'll copy and paste the outline to make my own version so I can give estimates without biasing your guys' estimates.

1:22:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
But is this the finished outline? This is like what Min will mock up earlier today.

1:22:26 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, so just adding the rest of the cards, like if we see any gaps, right? That's one of the tasks that I mentioned, right? OK.

1:22:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will you be able to sync up with us like PM IST, like India Standard Time, like 5 PM? 3 PM?

1:22:45 - Francisca Soto 
I don't know. No, that's that's like 2 a.m. Wait, what is that? That's a.m. No, no, that's the 3 a.m. For me. It's way too late. I'll be able to do it. Latest is probably like, um, probably Uh, yeah, 12 noon for you guys.

1:23:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's like when I'm waking up.

1:23:18 - Francisca Soto 
All right, well, we'll see if... All right, so everyone can... Let's make sure we add all the cards, look for missing links. And then from there, we can each make our own estimates. You guys can probably do it in a call if you guys are all online at the same time.

1:23:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
When will you be sending them? Since you'll be asleep by the time we're waking up.

1:23:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

1:23:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, can you hear us?

1:23:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
When will you send it? Because you'll be asleep by the time we're getting off.

1:23:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Send what?

1:23:56 - Francisca Soto 
Your estimates.

1:23:58 - Francisca Soto 
I'm just going to put them on the FigJam.

1:24:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like in this one? Right here? Where everyone's?

1:24:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:24:07 - Francisca Soto 
Like I said, I'll copy and paste the whole thing and put mine below with the estimates.

1:24:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

1:24:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
What do you guys need me to know?

1:24:25 - Francisca Soto 
So there's no actual technical, there's no, there's no, um, designing of software and solutions in this, right?

1:24:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
So all the estimates, uh, we're assigning a discovering your why workshop. Which is a software. We're designing this during your live workshop.

1:24:48 - Francisca Soto 
Like the actual solutions.

1:24:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, this is the solution. I don't know what's sticking with the code.

1:25:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like there's no coding right now.

1:25:06 - Francisca Soto 
We're not thinking, okay, we're going to write this code. That's going to interact with this code.

1:25:11 - Francisca Soto 
No.

1:25:13 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, so the estimates are just kind of from experience and in our imagination. Oh, this is how we could implement it. So that would take like this, right?

1:25:23 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah.

1:25:24 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah.

1:25:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:25:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
And if we did have like an implementation plan, we wouldn't be having it on this fake gem. It would be more of like an internal private one.

1:25:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's why I duplicated it and made another one for estimations earlier, because I didn't want to put the estimations on the public one with Kuhn, in case he jumped in and looked at them and got scared or something.

1:26:07 - Francisca Soto 
Alright, so... Okay, so sounds good then. I'll... Spending my available time today adding any cards that seem missing. Does the order of the grey cards, like going from top to down, matter?

1:26:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No.

1:26:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No.

1:26:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

1:26:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Errors in between are just because I've been too lazy to click on them and select no error.

1:26:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay.

1:26:35 - Francisca Soto 
I think I destroyed this arrow. It's okay.

1:26:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's just for decoration purposes anyways.

1:26:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, now you destroyed it.

1:26:46 - Francisca Soto 
Alright, so I'll see you guys hopefully This is the most annoying part of the time zone, so I'll see you guys later. Yes, later.

1:27:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, like tomorrow, you mean?

1:27:08 - Francisca Soto 
I'll see you as soon as possible.

1:27:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Next meeting. We'll see each other at next meeting.

1:27:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:27:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
How many hours? Like over 24, I'm thinking, right?

1:27:17 - Francisca Soto 
hopefully not well maybe exactly 20 or like 23 if we're getting on at this time again tomorrow think 21 yeah I can get on with with will and um Chinmay may like probably 10 p.m your time jonas okay sounds

1:27:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
good yeah that's that's the time I go for dinner oh roughly 8.30 p.m. My time. There's a fixed time for my dinner.

1:27:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's 8.30 p.m. Your time, Chinmay. He wants to meet up.

1:27:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, and that is the time I go for dinner.

1:28:01 - Francisca Soto 
Oh, okay. Roughly that time. After dinner or whatever.

1:28:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
Like, it can be available an hour after that.

1:28:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, okay.

1:28:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'll let you know if I'm available exactly at that time.

1:28:21 - Francisca Soto 
Also, what will be our goals for tomorrow? With the estimates, I believe.

1:28:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
So everyone should copy and paste and enter their own estimates?

1:28:50 - Francisca Soto 
Yeah, that's after we have all the cards on paper, all the cards down there. Right now, first place is make sure all the cards are there. We don't want to miss any. And then...

1:29:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's the deadline for that, by the way? The making sure the cards are there?

1:29:09 - Francisca Soto 
So I mean, yeah, just since the whole, we want to send it to Kuhn by like 5 p.m. Jonas's time. So we want to have the card is down. I would say it takes like an hour to like 30, yeah, I'd say an hour to estimate. So 4 p.m. Roughly Jonas's time.

1:29:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay. 2.30 my time.

1:29:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
yeah and then five for will all right sounds good guys I'll see you guys have a nice day have a good night good morning to me yeah to me too to be honest good morning you""","Finalize Adapt Spec and Estimations Transcript.txt"

Thu, Aug 8, 2024

0:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey there, hi, how are you?

0:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Good, good, good. What about you?

0:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, all good.

0:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Have you looked at the Figma file that I have created for brain project?

0:18 - Jorge Lewis 
I did, I did, I did. I made some, so I went down a rabbit hole yesterday of just learning some stuff. Can you give me an idea of what's the flow for this ADAPT simulation, what kind of thing we have to work with?

0:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. So, so that's what we'll get into. So we'll kind of today in this, in this hour, I think probably we'll do an hour and a half. We'll kind of figure out what do we, what are the requirements? What do we require the system to accomplish? Um, and then we'll go into kind of making it.

1:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. So are we creating in Figma or in like the code stuff?

1:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So we'll start with Figma and then we'll go into the code. Okay. It's only a span, maybe 10 minutes in the, in the Figma.

1:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

1:17 - Jorge Lewis 
We can take a quick look at your graph from yesterday. These are all of my thoughts from yesterday. I was just doing a lot of learning.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's gonna be a big issue, which I put a message yesterday, but people didn't understand is that we're doing so much data. So every day, if you look at, I did some math here, every day it's 85,600 words. So that's not too much in terms of like, that's around 430 kilobytes, that's fine. But when you, put that into a vector database, it's about one gigabyte, that many words. And when you put in a knowledge graph, then it scales much, it's much harder to scale. So there's gonna be a big, there's gonna be that issue, it's gonna be too big. Like of course we can use really powerful servers and stuff, but it just can't scale. This is one gigabyte a day over, like for a knowledge graph, since it's more, it's harder, or it's a bigger, data structure, it's going to be much bigger. So like over 10 days, when you connect multiple nodes, like it's just, uh, I think it'll get out of hand. So we need to figure out that.

2:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Data is the main concern, like how we keep updated and you know, uh, how can we manage that as well? Because the data is changing each and every day. So we have to, yeah.

2:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, so I put a, I put a note here, an idea to have a longterm and a short term system where We have our long-term system that gets updated maybe once a day or once every so often. And then we have a short-term system which is very basic, like just simple rag maybe. The long-term can be a knowledge graph and the new one can be a vector database.

3:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, yeah, so I did take a look at yours. Although some of the, I really like this pros and cons list, by the way. I didn't see this until after this morning. I was looking at the graph and then I saw that.

3:34 - Jorge Lewis 
But for the graph, I didn't totally understand all of the items.

3:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. So let me get you. Will I explain like what's my idea behind?

3:46 - Jorge Lewis 
We can we can try to do that another time since I would like to do the the adapt evaluation system So after the adapt thing if I still have time then we can do that.

3:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay?

3:54 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Yeah, so let's let's get into so I'll go to Adapt project and I'll make a new design file a new fig gem board Or actually I'll go to the go to the adapt spec page the main one and then make a new page and All right, so I'll make a new page. All right, can you see the new page?

4:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I can.

4:43 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, simulation, I can see.

4:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So what does this need to accomplish? Let's see. So we need it to generate synthetic conversations so that admins can How up to date are you on your DAD projects?

5:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like I know the graph working like the check-in the chatting and Onboarding, yeah, the last onboarding I know a little bit.

5:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

5:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, pretty much same. Okay, so pretty much, do you understand the vision of ADAPT, the goal?

5:58 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, so it's kind of 10 weeks framework. It will ask the goal of the user, like whether he wants to lose the weight or what's the motivation he wants within these 10 weeks. And during that, it will get the similar exercises. It will get the data, like the daily check-ins. And based on that, a performance review will be given to the user.

6:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

6:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's the main part of the app. Sorry, that's the start of the app.

6:38 - Jorge Lewis 
The main part of the app, though, is after that, where we understand his goal and why he's trying to achieve it, and then we're going to help him do that. Because understanding his goal and helping him understand his goal is good, but now the main point of the app is to help him achieve it. All the features you can see on the page one. We have the reminders and nudges, the daily check-ins, the day-to-day mentoring, and the milestones. So these are the four main systems that are going to be used throughout the core app. So reminders and nudges, okay. Actually, this is a, follow me over.

7:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, here, here. So this is the mentor.

7:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Mentor has three things to do.

7:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold up.

7:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I'll explain it like this. The core app has a mentor. The main agent that the user will be interacting with is the mentor. Sometimes when there's a dip in performance and the mentor gets notified by perhaps an analyst agent saying, hey, the user has been lacking on this. And then the mentor will say, okay, user, do you want to start a coaching session? And that's the coach's job. The coach's job is to go really in detail about why is the user lacking and not making progress towards their goals. What is stopping them? Do they have to update their goal? Do they have to agree on a new system, like some new practices they should do. Anyways, the mentor, his job is just facilitating everyday conversation. One of the main things that you guys were working on before was a daily check-in, right? So this is when you know about the day-to-day mentoring. All this is really is just the Everything other than the daily check-in, I think. It's kind of giving the mentor the ability to help the user and coach the user with simple things. So this will be mostly using data sources related to health, fitness, sleep, all those things so that he can provide advice. So I think this is mostly a very simple chatbot, the mentor. And then he has tools which can make him do a daily check-in.

9:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Although this LMS feature, by the way, so initially Kuhn wanted to have an LMS, a learning management system. He wanted to, it was like kind of pretty separate to this whole app so that the, there's an LMS, the user watches a video every day and the mentor can ask the user, Hey, have you watched the video? Uh, but I don't know where Kuhn is on that right now. I think he's changed his mind a little bit since now this is becoming like a, the term he uses is a, um, is a health vault, I think, or health bank, something like that.

9:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you familiar with the term? He just made it up, but he's been using that word a bit in the chat.

10:01 - Hasnain sayyed 
Which word?

10:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Health bank, I think.

10:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I haven't heard that.

10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

10:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
But I know this LMS content like it will be recommending video based on the user past history.

10:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Not recommending but just so there's there's one video every day for the user so the user picks a course I think there's gonna be multiple courses and they pick a course every day there's a new video that they have to watch. But I don't know if that's the case anymore. I don't know if Kuon has changed it or how he's been regarding that. We'll have to get updated on that.

10:46 - Jorge Lewis 
The rest of the system, reminders, milestones, these two are just very simple. What the mentor can do is remind the user.

11:01 - Jorge Lewis 
through notifications, saying, for example, hey, your bedtime is in three hours, you shouldn't drink coffee, for example.

11:12 - Jorge Lewis 
And the milestones are pretty much a way to motivate the user. So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over a number of days. So we present to the user saying, hey, you've reached a new milestone. You've walked 1,000 kilometers. That's like walking from France to Italy.

11:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, one key aspect of making it very visual, the milestone. So not just, oh, you walked a thousand kilometers, like that doesn't mean anything. But instead of telling them they walked from France to Italy, that's like, oh, wow.

12:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

12:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah, I hope that gives a good idea on the system, so.

12:17 - Jorge Lewis 
So what the system needs to accomplish is generate synthetic conversations so that admins can use them to improve the system through the prompts and adding reviews. The reviews is just a few-shot prompting. Are you familiar with them?

12:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

12:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you seen them before?

12:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

12:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's just a few-shot prompting.

12:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So what we need to do, one complication is that we probably don't, well, hmm. Okay, no. So what this is going to entail is we need to create a, what do we call it? A synthetic user.

13:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So someone needs the ability.

13:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Admin needs the capability to create new synthetic users.

13:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I got an idea what you are trying to say.

13:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
So synthetic user is basically a topic based thing, for example, based on different scenarios, the synthetic agent, you know, we can embed the few short and the prompts dynamically to that topic only. And the admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic agents. Is that what you are trying to point?

14:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I don't think so.

14:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
I mean, you know, the URL for the project Like I just want to know what capabilities the synthetic user will have. Just simple.

14:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So the synthetic user is all the synthetic users job or the synthetic user is really just the fake user, right? Does that make sense?

14:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah. Makes sense.

14:39 - Jorge Lewis 
But so his old, his end goal for the synthetic user is to pretend to be a user and generates a, a synthetic conversation. So synthetic data. Okay. But there's some things, so for example, I want to, let me share my screen actually.

15:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see?

15:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I can see.

15:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you know the URL to the app?

15:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes.

15:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
So let's send you.

15:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, yes, please.

15:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Send in the chat.

15:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So, so here, wow, that's a lot of users. Um, so here is, is this is like kind of a, just a temporary kind of page for selecting a user where after we use user authentication, will be gone. But what I was thinking is, since these are all users, or actually, no this should probably be in the admin panel. So you see how I have to select profile when I want to modify the prompts.

16:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I'm thinking we do is somewhere on the sidebar, we can have a page called simulation. And in that simulation, we have a button. We can configure the synthetic user. So a synthetic user can have the properties of this. So we can tell it its main objective to test, and then What else? We can just give it some background, like personality. Or give it a user profile. Or goal, maybe.

17:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so this is the goal, the main objective. So this can also be, This can be generic.

17:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So just no goal.

17:41 - Jorge Lewis 
A synthetic user needs the prompt, it needs to understand, or we need to tell it who it is. So it's a user, or you are chatting with a life coach bot, you know, and tell it the thing. So we need to give it, tell it who it is and what.

18:13 - Jorge Lewis 
You are the person So, uh, hardships might be.

18:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, so what we also need to do, which is quite important, is simulating multiple days because the chapel actually uses time.

18:47 - Jorge Lewis 
We need to make sure that... Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.

18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
We need a way to...

19:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
a way to simulate time to control time based on time interval we can have the chatting with the synthetic like per day or one hour two hour maybe maybe even like per 10 minutes right oh yeah 10 minutes Um...

19:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
But over here, every synthetic user will have a different kind of personality, right? Like the few short.

20:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So I don't understand that part. I don't, I don't think so. Can you, can you kind of keep going?

20:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. So, so like if admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic users, so each user which is created will have a similar kind of personality or like the talking or the chatting way, like the few shots that we are giving to each synthetic user, like the history or data or each synthetic user will have a different kind of knowledge.

20:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, they, they should be mostly the same. So like, um, let me come up a little wireframe here. How do I, So we have, so we can give it name.

21:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
We can give it personality.

21:14 - Jorge Lewis 
We can give it goal. It's objective. So this, just a little note.

21:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Objective is a behavior of adapt that the synthetic user is trying to test or exploit. What else?

22:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess the profile information, so just the stuff that's in the super base in the profile table. So every user has, so we need to assign it like things like it's goal.

22:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just check. Ah, I'm going to have to sign in. But you get what I mean. Within the profile information, there's their goal, their Y, weight, height.

22:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Basic onboarding.

22:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like all the information we gather from the onboarding, exactly. So what else?

23:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess it's a list that we can copy from onboarding. So I think with that, there's probably going to be things that pop up that we can't see right now, but I think we might as well get started in this development. There's some things we can start on.

23:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

23:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So one thing, since we're working on the AI stuff only, for creating synthetics users, we can, since we don't want to work on any of the front end, we can just use directly in super base. We can manually create a table and manual create rows. All right. So I'll hand it off to you. Yeah. So we'll, There's different ways pair programming sessions work. You can do like pilot driver or what is it? Driver. I don't know, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you lead the way and I'm going to kind of chime in here and there.

24:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. So, uh, what things should I start with? Like

24:22 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can we just create the flow like the first we will be working on this, then this, then this, because there are multiple things in this module.

24:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's create a very basic system. So what do we need in order to simulate a conversation? What is the requirement?

24:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
The first thing is data, of course, because, uh, it is a fake user, first of all. So, uh, the table that you have created, we need that then the prompt, uh, the basic few short, like, uh, the knowledge, uh, on the basis of which the fake user will chat with the agent. So that's the main thing. And, uh, uh, the function functionality, like, uh, to automate this thing, uh, because, uh, the API only hits when, uh, event on click event will trigger. So we have to create a functionality for that. Uh, so that, uh, on each day, 10 minutes.

25:24 - Jorge Lewis 
The, the, the one where we, because the user we're not, we don't have a real user anymore. We're not sending a message. So we have our AI system and we have the user, but we probably use it more. So we're going to have to replace it with the synthetic user.

25:43 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, correct. So that's what I'm telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.

25:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, keep going. Which one? We're going to have to probably work and make, yeah.

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Your voice is breaking. We're going to, we're going to have to work.

26:09 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's cause I think, I think there's a bit of a delay, so we keep cutting each other, but we're going to have to work on super base probably to create some manual things.

26:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

26:22 - Jorge Lewis 
All right. So let's open the project. Start your screen share. Do you use this code or VS code?

26:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. Can you share a live share link?

26:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, should I open that app project or? Yeah, yeah. Okay.

26:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just a second. I just pulled the latest one.

27:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
On which branch should I pull?

27:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Just a second.

27:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Probably alpha. I don't know.

27:21 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just a second.

28:19 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes.

28:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
I'm now in alpha right now.

28:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Do you mind sharing your screen, by the way?

28:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah, sure.

28:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Show the whole screen so I can see the web server as well as the super-based things you're doing.

29:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
So first in the super base thing.

29:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should we create the function to dynamically create this synthetic user or first we should manually interrupt the thing or what else?

29:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So to start off, since that's kind of not the creating a synthetic user is part of what we can do, but I think we should start off with making a synthetic user and then go from there. But, but we have to think, yeah.

30:07 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's create one in the super base first.

30:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
So we have to create a new column for that, right? Because we don't have to merge the real users with the synthetic one.

30:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Or what say?

30:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
That's what I was thinking as well.

30:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
or just create a column here a new table or a new column right the column will identify like a real user or a synthetic user what say exactly what I was saying but my concern is that this table is

30:49 - Jorge Lewis 
linked to the chat one the id is linked to if you can see the um no it's linked to the users table that superbase uses for authentication So we can create a new profiles and you try to.

31:12 - Jorge Lewis 
If you tried to create a new row, it won't work like it because you need the ID needs to be linked to a insert the green button near the top.

31:31 - Jorge Lewis 
the green insert button above ID. I can draw on your screen, I think, right? No, let me see. I'm trying to see how I can color. Oh, you have it there.

31:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, here we go.

32:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm, I guess only you can.

32:07 - Jorge Lewis 
But do you see the insert button? It's green, near the top.

32:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Insert button? Yeah.

32:18 - Jorge Lewis 
A little bit left.

32:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

32:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Try to insert row. And you'll see that the ID has a foreign key relation to the users table, which means that unless we create a new user in the users table using super-based authentication, we can't create a new row in this table. So that's going to prevent us from creating synthetic users like we might want to with that.

32:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So like you proposed, I think we're going to have to make a new table. And even if we can later add just a column in the profile table, it takes five minutes, right? So it's better to kind of just start. So let's make a new table. Synthetic user or synthetic profile maybe to keep it the same.

33:21 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I off this RLS, the rule level security because I think it's disabled. Yeah, turn it off, turn it off.

33:33 - Jorge Lewis 
We don't want to, it'll be, it'll be annoying. It just, the best practice is before you go to production, you want to turn all those on, but

33:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm. Correct.

33:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
So the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.

33:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.

34:05 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you copy paste over here? It will be fast. Like the name of columns, because it needs to be similar.

34:18 - Jorge Lewis 
The, um, I'm still trying to sign into the super basic account. Um, does super base have like sign in with, uh, Google?

34:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, it has.

34:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's exactly, but I can't see it.

34:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, no, I mean like, it's its own platform.

34:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, so I don't think so.

35:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Or else I can copy paste over here.

35:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Oh, there we go. I'm in. Nice.

35:41 - Hasnain sayyed 
I'm just writing the column attribute. So I just copy paste.

35:51 - Jorge Lewis 
What I want to note on though, what I want to note on is that this synthetic user for example first name and last name hmm they don't need to be separate I think what do you think like or actually

36:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
huh actually no they do yeah I think it needs to be identical to the profile table yeah yeah um Because the functions, uh, if they're going to be using the first name, it's not using, uh, it's needs to be similar because there will be other, uh, the data is null. Okay.

36:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. So what I've also noticed though, is that the code right now is using, um, is using the profiles table, right? So if we want to make it use the Profiles table or the synthetic user table without having to rewrite all the code Should we use like an if state like should we in the request to call the AI? That we probably need to add a parameter or something like synthetic so that we can add an add a an if operation so like if this is synthetic use the The synthetic table does that make sense?

37:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah, I What I am thinking is, while the first flow, the Q1 created the synthetic user, then we have to create an external function which gets the ability for that agent, the synthetic user, to automatically chat with the agent. So we have to create that function. And the graph will be same, of course. The flow and the graph, the functions will be same. We just have to create a functionality that will automate the synthetic user to pass the message or the prompt or whatever, the query. Automatically, once it has received the agent response, then the user will automatically send That's the main rule over here. Because this is just a data. Sorry, I just clicked on Zoom. Yeah. So this is just, uh, you know, uh, the character or the character building thing. We can say, Oh, one thing we can do, we can, uh, I can just discard here. I can just come here. Uh, should I download this? Should I download this in CSV and directly, you know, or create a new table like the synthetic and import that thing? It will be much more easier.

38:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And then, um, and then just modify from there.

38:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah. It's easy then because manually entering will take much more time.

38:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. And just let's see CSV.

38:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. I just need to drop you.

38:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. It has come here.

39:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Save.

39:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, the primary key will be the ID, right? And yes, save.

39:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Can I see the, the, the prop, the columns like that? You scroll down a little bit.

39:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. We can create, uh, it's adding the column.

39:38 - Jorge Lewis 
The ID should be you, you ID.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's a little bit too late, but

39:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
It has added. OK. We can edit here.

40:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think it won't change now.

40:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I thought.

40:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Come on, come on, come on.

40:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. I think it's updated. Yes. It's updated.

40:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Luckily.

40:21 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Um, okay. So that's, that's nice. All that done. And now we can, we can, I think we can delete all except maybe two.

40:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

40:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, In case you didn't know, if you click the button, the checkbox button on the same row as the labels, it does all. Yeah, yeah.

40:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
The dark UI, it's hard to find the options.

40:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah, you're on a laptop. Yeah, you're on a laptop.

41:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I have the same problem. When it's nighttime for me and I put my monitor on like a lower brightness, all the dark UI starts to kind of fade in.

41:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Now we can go into the code and start working.

41:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's see what we're missing from this that we might need. We need to tell the agent.

41:35 - Jorge Lewis 
We need to tell the agent, the synthetic profile, who it is or what its objective is. Because like me as a user, I know what I'm doing. So I think we can add a column for prompts. So if you go to the, if you scroll left a little bit.

41:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, yeah, left, left. Yeah, no, the other way, the other way.

42:04 - Jorge Lewis 
More, more. There's a prompts column that I'm looking for.

42:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, it's there.

42:10 - Jorge Lewis 
So here, so this column in a real profile is connected to the admin page. But since this synthetic user is not accessing the admin page, I think we can change it. I think we can change the structure of it.

42:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I wonder if Yeah, I think that should be fine. Let's do that. So in the structure of the...

42:42 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll also share my screen, by the way.

42:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, please, please.

42:48 - Jorge Lewis 
And that way we can just go back and forth.

42:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. What I'm thinking is...

42:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should we add an option to the admin panel, like, or get a, like, if the flow that we have decided will add a similar kind of user, because we haven't created any option to, you know, change the user character or the few short prompt, whatever. So we can have some options to admin that, like four or five examples, we have to, create that data. And whenever the user clicks on, whenever the admin clicks, like, yeah, I need this character, I need this synthetic user character, maybe like a goal will be different for that synthetic user. Have you got the point?

43:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so you see my screen share.

43:59 - Jorge Lewis 
We have input fields for the prompt We have input fields for the prompt so they They can go in here and modify the prompts in the same way. I think we can modify the prompts of the the characteristics of the the Synthetic guy. So for example, what I can do is I'll I'll kind of, actually let me take a screenshot of this. So what I want is a button here that says synthetic users. Something like this maybe. And when it opens it, let me just kind of make this empty.

44:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so pretend like I've just, there. So here, what I think we can do is have, so I think what we'll have is two tabs. We'll have manage users.

45:24 - Jorge Lewis 
And then we'll have a new user.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So the managed users, what it's going to do is help with being able to remove, or actually just, okay, I have an idea actually. So when you go to, synthetic users, the UI will look like a table with all of the properties. And then we can have a button at the top. Can I move this? A button at the top.

46:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Add new synthetic user. And when you click this, it opens a pop-up.

46:25 - Jorge Lewis 
new pop-up or a model like yeah a model model yeah what do we see and then we have we can give it a new name hmm so pretty much all of it So we get a new name, a new personality, the objective.

47:02 - Jorge Lewis 
This one can be null. So I guess all of them can be null and we can have a default.

47:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it.

47:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So for example, the objective, when it's default, could literally be nothing. We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here. So this is their profile information that they set, okay. So this, I guess this can be default as well. We can just set, maybe we pre-fill all of these with the default information and then so that Kuen can make a lot of new users fast. And if he wants to change it, then he can.

48:07 - Jorge Lewis 
And maybe, this is just an idea, no clue, temperature.

48:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm like that.

48:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
But yes, we have to create a new column. Yes, for every user for the temperature if you want.

48:42 - Jorge Lewis 
That will be dynamic for each create.

48:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So is it is it all good or? Yeah, yeah.

48:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, cool. Let's go, let's go into, uh, working on that.

49:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it. So which part, uh, should we start the first, uh, the UI, AI work?

49:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so the UI, we'll leave it to a front end. Have you worked with spells?

49:22 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, no, actually I am proficient in react next. Yeah.

49:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we'll run that for now. We can worry about the backend. All of this here can be done just by creating new, we can set all this data with just doing it in Superbase. So these here, so actually this profile information is sets, this is already from, that's already in the table. This is new, and this is new.

49:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

49:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Right. I'm sure. Correct.

50:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
So these are all new ones, but, uh, if you create the temperature, uh, uh, additional point of here, so it will affect the real user or else we have to, uh, set like, uh, if, uh, the condition, like if I did a synthetic user, then it will be, uh, getting from the database or else, uh, the default temperature of all the real user will be like that.

50:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think so, yeah. So, in the call, in the function that does... I think it's just called run, actually. In that function, we can take in a parameter saying synthetic or not, and then anywhere in the code we can access that variable.

50:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so...

50:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I'll leave it up to you.

50:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
the basic thing here if I am just a quick recap the functionality of the backend will be pointing the listing all the you know the user the synthetic user in this dashboard it will be a function a normal select all thing and then While clicking on the new user, it will be picking the default value. I think there doesn't need to be any database. Or we can just have a normal JSON created. We can just create a JSON over here in the, and it will be storing, uh, in our local file only if we want, or maybe in the database. And this data will be, uh, you know, fetching, when the user, when the, and if that, uh, values change, it already been stored in the state like, uh, uh, the input state and if your admin takes on create, the updated value will be creating a new row in the super base.

52:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

52:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so the flow of... Okay, so actually let's discuss quickly the flow after I click the create button when I create a new synthetic user. What should happen is that... Let me think actually.

52:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So instead of 10 because I think that's too long, because imagine this, if Kuen wants to simulate one month of the user interacting with a bot, is too 10 long, that'll be 300 minutes. So obviously if we could, we'd make it instantly. We'd make it, you click create synthetic user and it has one month or 10 months of data, of conversation data done, but the LLMs are too slow, so how do we figure out how do we figure that out based

53:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
on data length or based on time interval these are two options I feel but like the number of questions interval Like number of questions asked by the synthetic user, we can also point that as well. Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.

53:31 - Jorge Lewis 
So for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?

53:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, right.

53:48 - Jorge Lewis 
We can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I think will be kind of annoying is, so the synthetic user, how will he or when will he send a message? Because how that will work is, this guy sends a message to this guy, this guy responds immediately, the bot responds immediately. And then the synthetic user, because he's in LLM, will receive the response and respond immediately as well. And it'll keep going. There's no way to say, okay, um, yeah, no, not even waiting for it. Like for example, a normal user, they wake up, they'll open the app, they'll talk, chat with the user, the chatbot and say, Hey, um, hi. They'll have a conversation. The phone, the usual, put the phone down. But in our case, the synthetic user, how do we tell him to put the phone down?

54:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

54:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
One, one, one idea.

54:59 - Jorge Lewis 
One idea is that we separate, um, we give the, the synthetic user, their concept of a, um, of, of a conversation and the synthetic user will know, or we'll have an objective for each conversation. And when it reaches that objective, it closes the conversation and then it, um, it calls a function saying let's time elapse and it lets an hour or two pass fake, fake one hour or two.

55:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, okay. I got it. Um, but I'm thinking like how we create that function, like, uh, while conversation between two points, we have to create a loop kind of thing that this is the basic, uh, brute force approach or else we have to based on we have to create a function like based on the like response from the synthetic user it will it will think like if the synthetic user wants to ask another question like wants to give another answer or not or like it will stop at that point this is the two solutions I can think like the

56:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the loop, so I have an idea, but it might be the same as a loop. It's like a brute force, like you said. A conversation is five minutes. So that after five minutes, they stop talking and we let time to pass. Is that what you're suggesting?

56:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, correct, correct.

56:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I think we can do that, yeah.

56:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But like right now, we don't have to worry about that. We can just make it have, We can just let it go back and forth. We don't have to worry. And then later we can worry about controlling the time. How does that sound?

56:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Correct. We can change the time, whatever we want. It's just one variable we have to change.

57:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, OK, cool.

57:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, there are normal edge cases in the background, like the synthetic user has to chat one day at a time, like only one day, five minutes or two minutes, whatever we set. It won't have to reiterate. Yeah, that's the normal edge case.

57:21 - Jorge Lewis 
We can add all these edge cases, I think, one by one if we need to, right?

57:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. We have, we have to add a column here. We have to add, uh, like, uh, uh, maybe the last time, uh, he chatted and, uh, based on the last time, uh, it will add 24 hours, whether, uh, it is, uh, like, uh, greater, like it will compare the current time and the last time. And whether there is a gap of 24 hours or not, if there is not a 24 hours gap, then it won't execute that function or if there is a gap.

58:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
One point I have, the one most important question is, it is not a WebSocket, right? It is a HTTP request. Like, how can, how could we let the synthetic user run by itself? Like, okay, the condition satisfies, like, yeah. There is a gap between 24 hours maybe. Then how the synthetic agent will let know like, yeah, there is a 24 hours gap. Like the API hit.

58:39 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a good point. I think we'll have to use some sort of either edge servers or edge functions or, um, yeah, I think something related to edge functions.

58:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

59:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But we, yeah, so we'll worry about time later since that can be added on top of, um, and by the way, just a quick concept of how we can control all the time is in data in super base, we can store the time, um, like normal, like, uh, as normal, but in the, in the system, the code, we divide it by a multiplier. So that's one, one minute for us.

59:25 - Jorge Lewis 
we multiply it by a multiplier, not divide it. So 20 seconds for us, we multiply it by 100, that's 2,000 for them.

59:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, all right, let's get into it. So you can open VS Code, share a live share link. So it's 1.30, we've already done an hour. Let's do 30 more minutes if you don't mind. Just so we can get some coding in.

59:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, sure.

1:00:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, I have sent in the chat.

1:00:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you access it?

1:00:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Trying now.

1:01:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I create a column here that the last time maybe, because that's the starting point to write the function, the last time compared by the current time.

1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, could you say that again? I was working on the VS code thing.

1:01:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so I was telling like, we have to like, as I said, before, we have to add a time variable in the synthetic table, like the last run.

1:01:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, last executed. Oh, yeah. So We can compare the last executed with the current time. And if that is not more than 24 hours, then that synthetic user won't execute. And if it is more than two hours or maybe equal to, then we can execute.

1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but what I would suggest is we ignore the time controlling first because that will expand the scope a lot and there's so many different edge cases to manage that it'll kind of not allow us to focus on getting something first. So we have this task, we have to make a simulation system. We need this system, we want to, we want to get something done, something that we can see the smallest thing that we can see is going to be one conversation back and forth. We don't need to worry about time. It's just a user having the synthetic user having a conversation with the ball. You can have a stop button so that they don't forever go on.

1:03:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then later you can already be excited to see that you can have conversations. And, um, yeah.

1:03:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it.

1:03:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
So first thing, what should we start like with the super base creating functions or what else? What do you suggest?

1:03:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'll leave it up to you. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it up to you. You, you can think, okay, we've got a couple of things to do. I'm just picking one. Usually it works pretty well. Just starting. It's hard to find the right answer because they're all OK.

1:03:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Because the main thing that is coming to my mind is that function to create.

1:04:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
I'm thinking how to execute that.

1:04:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so one thing we can do is and getting this for this. You we have to create a rag over here like the sorry the graph sorry the graph will be similar to this everything will be similar to this folder but that will make the easy and the starting point will be

1:06:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
graph Okay.

1:06:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
Everything I think will be similar, uh, to this folder itself. Uh, just, uh, this folder is calling the real user. It will, in this folder, we will be calling the synthetic user. And additionally, uh, the top layer will be the edge case that we have talked like the time variable.

1:06:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Right.

1:06:37 - Jorge Lewis 
We, we, I don't think so. Are you, are you suggesting we just copy and paste the AI folder?

1:06:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, yes. Or I don't like, are you saying that the not copy pasting, like, uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar.

1:07:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:07:32 - Jorge Lewis 
In the AI folder, there's one function that's being called somewhere, run. So inside run.

1:07:43 - Jorge Lewis 
There's one function that's been called run. This is to interact with the chatbot. We're here, we're passing it profile ID, we're passing it user message and user examples prompt. Profile ID is the only thing that's going to be different.

1:08:05 - Jorge Lewis 
So in, within synthetic user, what we need to do is somehow call this run function, right? Correct.

1:08:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct.

1:08:13 - Jorge Lewis 
We, in essence, we need to call the run function.

1:08:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
So, and the top layer will just be the like, the edge case function that I have talked like one day, one conversation, like one day, one session, the top layer will be that the edge case condition. And we just have to create a loop over here because in this file, it's just a one case scenario, like a one way scenario. It's not a loop where it's just a HTTP request, like pointing, running this function and getting the return for one conversation. But we have to create a loop kind of thing over here.

1:08:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Based on time.

1:08:58 - Jorge Lewis 
As we discussed, 30 seconds or 1 minute.

1:09:09 - Jorge Lewis 
As I said, we have to reduce the scope right now. We want to focus on one thing right now. When you're developing software, if you're worrying about all the 30 different things that have to be made, You're never going to make one thing. Right now, we want to get a conversation happening between the bot and the user. Then we can worry about adding in time into the code. So we need to isolate small things to make.

1:09:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I copy paste this thing over here?

1:09:42 - Jorge Lewis 
This function? No, no.

1:09:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
I just have to change this thing. The user message will be not the parameter itself. It will be the previous. We will be getting it from the database or the few short.

1:10:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
What do you mean, few short?

1:10:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
The database, like the prompt that a Q1 is adding from the dashboard.

1:10:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
The user message will be, in the real use case, will be passed by the real user, right? But in the synthetic user, it doesn't have any, like, the user message from the real user. We have to get it from database, which will be in the scenario of future.

1:10:36 - Jorge Lewis 
For the synthetic user, we should be using a language model. There should be an agent.

1:10:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
OK.

1:10:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
So based on the- Yeah.

1:10:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Because we're trying to pretend this guy's a user. There's no reason not to use a language model. We're trying to create new data, not reuse old data.

1:11:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Got it.

1:11:13 - Jorge Lewis 
I was just saying- So I'm going to try to kind of start you off and see if it makes sense. So we have this run function that's being called by the dev bot. Let's go into the simple dev user. Let's import that function.

1:11:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me enable my copilot.

1:11:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, my co-pilot subscription ended.

1:12:28 - Jorge Lewis 
And then here, we know we want to call run. What are the properties?

1:12:41 - Jorge Lewis 
These are profile ID, so it's a string ID. What else?

1:12:53 - Jorge Lewis 
User message.

1:12:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So we need to message to do AI generated message.

1:13:07 - Jorge Lewis 
And then use example prompts just do hmm. What does that mean?

1:13:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh?

1:13:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's just a boolean template.

1:13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah false okay, so So we have this here const ID is So we need to get this ID from a We need to get this ID from SuperBase.

1:13:39 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, so just right here, maybe.

1:13:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So for now, let's use a hard-coded ID. So I'm going to go into SuperBase and copy one from the correct tables.

1:14:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just paste over here.

1:14:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
And it will be synthetic user.

1:14:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Synthetic profile, sorry.

1:14:33 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I'm going to copy this one.

1:14:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, no, this is just, yeah.

1:15:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know how you guys don't use super base. I mean, I'll compile it.

1:15:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Profile for, okay, so. Okay, so let's make a new file that generates a message. Message, yes. And then here we can just do prompt run.

1:15:50 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I've made just a simple run function and, or let me actually just.

1:16:00 - Jorge Lewis 
And then, okay.

1:16:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, I'm messing up with your if code.

1:16:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Why?

1:16:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, are you error tracking or?

1:16:42 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I add this data types like synthetic user in the database.types? So this error will be gone.

1:16:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me, I'm not seeing your screen. Over here. Yes. I don't have some of the highlighting because I'm on your live share.

1:17:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Generate the new types.

1:17:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

1:17:15 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a good idea.

1:17:28 - Jorge Lewis 
If there's only one super base call in the script or in the code, you don't want to name them. You can just leave them. So this is pretty, should be pretty obvious, I think.

1:17:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye!

1:18:18 - Jorge Lewis 
It's now gone.

1:19:11 - Hasnain sayyed 
We have to create an agent which passes this message.

1:19:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, yeah, it's generate message is there.

1:19:30 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm not getting all of the error highlighting that you are by the way.

1:20:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
What are we creating next?

1:21:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Next is.

1:21:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you keep sharing your screen? Because it was quite helpful.

1:21:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so we're going to, what's the statement? So we have a message.

1:22:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So, imagine the message history is no messages, so we're going to have the synthetic user generate a message first, and then the AdaptBot will reply to it. We need to wrap all this in a for loop.

1:22:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Which one? This?

1:22:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So the synthetic user and the response to that need to be looped if we want to kind of have a conversation. So let's say we want to have a conversation of 10 messages.

1:22:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
We can just do a for loop for So based on the user response, maybe like Sorry, based on the user question, we can point like, yeah, it's 10. Or maybe a normal pointer while const let a is equal to 10.

1:23:21 - Jorge Lewis 
2 Use a for loop, no?

1:23:29 - Hasnain sayyed 
Maybe, yes.

1:23:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I can't remember the syntax, though, so I'm going to search it up.

1:23:39 - Jorge Lewis 
For loop syntax, OK.

1:23:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's equal to 0, then 10.

1:23:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
A plus plus.

1:23:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:23:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
This is the basic syntax and it will be running 10 times.

1:24:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
The messages will be passing through this and RES we have to store this thing because the run function is performing actions on this as well.

1:24:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, we have events.

1:24:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
The one thing over here is, if you look my screen, yeah, so in the post chat, the events, it is storing the chat in events. So we have to club this ID to the events itself. Because the profile ID is also pointing to events.

1:25:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
What do you mean?

1:25:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like the history, the chat history is being stored in this event table. Yep. So this profile ID has a foreign key in this events.

1:25:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
Does it?

1:25:28 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

1:25:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
Where is that?

1:25:41 - Hasnain sayyed 
Ok, so it's externally storing. I failed. I thought.

1:25:52 - Jorge Lewis 
OK. So it is linked, though. It is linked. Go back to Superbase. There's a green icon next to it. That means it's linked. That means there's a foreign key.

1:26:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So no, on profile ID, that green icon, that means it's linked. No, no, no. Back where you were. Do you see the icon? Yeah, yeah. It's a foreign key with profile. So let's open up that detail of the column so that we can modify it. Because if it's foreign link to profile table, that means we can't add events from our synthetic user, which we want to. So let's see if we can add a foreign link.

1:26:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, there we go.

1:26:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice.

1:26:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
Select table profile.

1:26:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yes. Should I save?

1:26:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:26:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Id is in public. Yes. Cool. Hm.

1:27:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to profile ID.

1:27:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Insert or update.

1:27:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, save again? I couldn't finish reading the error.

1:27:26 - Jorge Lewis 
File is foreign key constraint.

1:27:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me see...

1:27:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Because if that doesn't work, but it should, if that doesn't work...

1:27:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I think the problem is that there's already items in that...

1:28:09 - Jorge Lewis 
There's already items in the table, which means that it can't switch it. So what we have to do is either delete all the items. Is that OK? Can we do that?

1:28:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, or else we can't edit this thing. Can't edit the value.

1:28:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so the only thing is if Kuhn is testing it, but I don't think he is. So let's just delete everything.

1:28:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
And if he says, why did you delete everything that we say in the synthetic profile, uh, we can delete and we can check, uh, if it's added because I feel, uh, the ID is similar, uh, but that doesn't the case.

1:29:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
let me delete this and try in the synthetic.

1:29:14 - Jorge Lewis 
No, the problem was because every row in the, or every row in the events table was linked, was a foreign key link to the profile ID. The structure of the cell was a foreign key link to profile ID. It was not foreign key. I wasn't a foreign key link to profile ID or, um, Uh, forward key to the profile ID or the synthetic profile ID. So now it is because I deleted all the events.

1:29:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:29:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So now we shouldn't have an issue with it.

1:30:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so we can copy this supervisor agent code over here, because whoa, in this file, what say there's there's Sorry, I was just looking at the code.

1:31:02 - Jorge Lewis 
There's a lot of, there's a prompt. So, okay. I see. Huh? So you know how, you know that we're exposing the prompts on the front end, right?

1:31:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Hmm.

1:31:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, so I saw that under supervisor, there is a lot of, there is, um, his system. What is this? Yeah. So, so if you follow me, Hmm. So here we give it its prompts here, but then we're also giving it more. This should be, we should try to, this is kind of as a backlog. I know this is probably temporary, but there should be a backlog for somebody to migrate it to the front end because we want everything, all the prompts to be exposed to the front end. So yeah, we need to.

1:31:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
On the backend, right?

1:31:58 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, it's the front end. We don't want text here. We don't want this text here. What we want to do is be using the data tape, the super base and accessing the prompts from there, which admins can modify from the front end.

1:32:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:32:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So we don't want to hard code the prompts here.

1:32:25 - Jorge Lewis 
But instead, we want to use a promise for the profile. So yeah, that's something to note out. So what is this here?

1:32:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, you can click on me somewhere.

1:32:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, could you also share your screen? Uh, I can.

1:33:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:33:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Okay. So, so we have this, this loop.

1:33:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I just copied this thing So we don't need this here Okay, so...

1:34:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Why is that still saying? Oh, expected zero. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Sorry. Okay, this is the...

1:34:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, we can edit this.

1:34:21 - Jorge Lewis 
This is the new guy. I thought this was the super generate message function.

1:34:29 - Hasnain sayyed 
So this, uh, this file is different. This is a generate message function. We can just, uh, let the LLM to generate, uh, the question on the behalf of synthetic agent. So, uh, the prompt, the prompt will be different.

1:34:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Is that make sense? Yeah, we just remove this all.

1:35:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Correct.

1:35:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is not a structure of profile. I believe this is a synthetic user.

1:35:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

1:35:39 - Jorge Lewis 
What was the definition of this profile though?

1:35:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Over here. So we can do type, uh, then back here.

1:36:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. It's not profiled. It's it's in. Yeah, there is no S. Correct. And this we have to export over here.

1:36:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:36:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So, is this correct over here? System and then, or is this a tuple?

1:36:31 - Jorge Lewis 
And then I have to do prompts.

1:36:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Or how was it before? Let me just copy this.

1:36:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So, it's a list. Oh, it's just the two, okay.

1:36:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So prompts teams, okay, so this is going to change from Like it's just prompt this is not gonna be using So how How should we go about structuring the profile structure? So if you see on my screen We have the prompt is Is it these three?

1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Or well, we're actually. Okay. So let me think.

1:37:28 - Jorge Lewis 
So this objective is, it can be just prompt. Personality can be part of the prompt and LM. Okay. Okay. So these two are just part of the prompt. So inside of the structure of here of synthetic profile, Should I re-upload the file?

1:37:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Because I have deleted.

1:37:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
Re-upload the file? Which file?

1:37:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
The CSV from the profile. So we will be having the users in the synthetic one. Like, do you want- I think, I think.

1:38:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:38:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Go ahead. Yes.

1:38:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, actually, you know what we could do to make it more dynamic and probably better, just a lot better code is within anywhere in the original code that's accessing the profile. So let me, let me go to man to kind of illustrate what I mean. So this function here is returning a profile, right?

1:38:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
Right. Just a second. Yes.

1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.

1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
It will be false for the default value. You can put the default value as well.

1:38:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. Good point. And then we do table. Synthetic.

1:39:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Or just do profile table.

1:39:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
Is it profile?

1:39:19 - Jorge Lewis 
We want to make sure it's, they're all the same. That's a big, that's important.

1:39:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So profiles with an S. So we wanted this one to be profiles with an S.

1:39:33 - Jorge Lewis 
There's of course best practices in terms of should we use S or not, but at least make them all the same. So if they all use S, use S.

1:39:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay.

1:39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Which means I believe in, yeah, I already added S, okay, nice. Or did you? Okay, so it comes, what else? And I think that's, it's just that table that we're changing, right?

1:39:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:39:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Or just do synthetic, we don't need it, we can just clean this up a bit.

1:40:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
I've added the data over you.

1:40:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So pretty much like that. And then we use, Oh, is that you?

1:40:30 - Jorge Lewis 
No.

1:40:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Huh?

1:40:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, So, what type, what does this take in?

1:40:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think the row, maybe?

1:41:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I think I know.

1:41:11 - Jorge Lewis 
If you go into database.types, it takes in...

1:41:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Take some of these things.

1:41:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Tables.

1:41:29 - Jorge Lewis 
How do I? Where's the

1:42:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
How should we add?

1:42:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
Let me try.

1:42:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye.

1:43:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I mean, if we use...

1:43:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, have you found the solution?

1:43:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So, not yet, but just kind of to think it through, this does take in a string, or it ends up being a string, but it's just typed differently. So maybe, or maybe actually. We can use this code.

1:43:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:43:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So if I put the string, if I do this, it works.

1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis 
But I want to reuse this variable profile table since we… I think use it down? Oh no, it's just once.

1:44:06 - Jorge Lewis 
We're only asking, we're only making the simple base request once, so I guess we can use this, but I wonder maybe we should figure it out instead of

1:44:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Let me try one thing.

1:45:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

1:45:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
That's it.

1:46:00 - Hasnain sayyed 
At 10 o'clock, she would get up and leave. What? Again? She would leave at 2.30 in the morning. You would come at 8.30?

1:46:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, no. She would come at 6.30 in the morning. She would come at 8.30 the morning. Sometimes, she would come late at night. She would come late at night and leave early in the morning. She would leave early in the morning. I would come at the 8.30 morning. She would come at 8.30 in the morning. I would eat and leave.

1:46:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
You think he made any progress?

1:47:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
I don't know.

1:47:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think that's better actually.

1:47:57 - Jorge Lewis 
But I can't tell because my screen doesn't show me the correct things.

1:48:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Showing you any errors? Yeah.

1:48:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think we both are in different areas.

1:48:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
Tables, it's not as stable, I think.

1:48:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think month of dates.

1:48:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Maybe.

1:48:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I mean, I'm fairly certain that the one here should work.

1:49:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you, it just, our screens are different. Yeah. Okay, let me, looks like we're going to disconnect it, I guess.

1:49:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
I mean, why is tables erroring there?

1:50:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, have you seen my daughter-in-law? Yes, she has gone to work.

1:50:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, really? Yes, she has gone to work. Why are you so late today? Are you busy? Yes, I am busy. Yes, I am busy.

1:50:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes I have to go at 6.30.

1:50:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I have to go I have to go at 6.30 I don't know why it's taking so long to load. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen, my camera so that, to see if it can go faster.

1:51:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

1:51:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, but yeah, it's just super slow. Like I clicked it's joining collaboration session for quite a while. Okay. But, um, okay. So I'll, I'll just ask you to do it. So instead of, so take copy and paste everything after the question mark.

1:51:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
This one.

1:51:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So the second one should be a cool one.

1:52:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

1:52:12 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyway, so copy copy those two so the table synthetic profile and tables profile the whole the whole thing Now it doesn't like it Oh no, there we go, cool. Is it airing for you?

1:52:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
Unknown word, it's failing.

1:52:56 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's just slow to update.

1:53:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you try... It looks like it's just confused. It's the same type of string, but it thinks it's something else. Like we just labeled it as something else. So all we need to do is just use the types that it needs. So we're synthetic here on the right-hand side of the equals is just is saying making it a string. But then we're just typing it as a tables synthetic profile. But for me, it's not giving any errors. But for you, it is. It's just saying it doesn't know what it is.

1:53:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's also getting error in the profile as well.

1:54:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
I said maybe.

1:54:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you push and then save all and push and I'll try to open it locally? Because it just feels like the IDE is not being very happy.

1:54:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
So should I push while creating a new branch?

1:54:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

1:55:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, create a new branch.

1:55:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
What should be the branch name?

1:55:29 - Jorge Lewis 
What did you suggest?

1:55:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
Features and synthetic profile.

1:55:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Maybe.

1:55:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, or yes.

1:55:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, whatever. That works.

1:56:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'm now in.

1:56:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:56:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:56:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you generated the superbase types again?

1:57:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Which one?

1:57:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
The superbase types.

1:57:11 - Hasnain sayyed 
The interface?

1:57:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So we made a new table. Have you generated the new types for it?

1:57:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I've created the types over here.

1:57:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Why it's not coming? Yeah. Yes, profiles. OK.

1:58:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I pushed on GitHub.

1:58:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

1:59:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
or else we can make this dynamic afterwards like just.

1:59:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Why is there so many branches open?

2:00:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, your, your branch, the branch name should not be with an S feature and then slash. That's why I couldn't, I was trying to check it out, check out, get checkout, but it wasn't finding it.

2:00:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh.

2:00:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Yeah, so my thing doesn't error. Does your thing still error with the type? Yes. Try restarting your IDE.

2:01:31 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's a very old name, so I shouldn't...

2:01:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
of extension which gets an error if my spelling mistake is there, so.

2:01:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, so is that what's erring?

2:01:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, no, it's not the extension one.

2:01:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, there's two. TypeString is not assignable to type.

2:02:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, maybe...

2:02:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, do. So I'm trying to figure out why I'm not getting those errors.

2:02:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, but try, try the string. So go to the strings and do as tables and then.

2:02:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Where in the data type.

2:02:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so when you're setting the screen, no, no. So right where you are, right where you are back, you want to cast the string to the type. So. Synthetic underscore profiles as, and then tables synthetic profiles. No, no, no, up, up, on the string, on the string.

2:02:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So the variable, the string, synthetic profiles, the string.

2:02:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:02:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Down, yeah.

2:02:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so we want to cast it as the table.

2:03:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Cannot, there's no type string to type.

2:03:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait a minute. Why is...

2:03:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's also getting type string is not assignable to the row.

2:03:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right.

2:03:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, are we spent enough time on this? So I had to do, um, and make, and just use the hard coded one.

2:03:46 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to use the rest of your beer book.

2:04:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, my God.

2:05:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

2:05:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I'm just coming in two minutes for washroom.

2:06:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye.

2:07:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Welcome back.

2:07:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So is it all done now?

2:07:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:07:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Is that problem solved?

2:07:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Well, which problem? All right, cool.

2:07:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. The type.

2:07:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:07:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, no, no, it's not solved. So the problem was that the problem is that we need to access either the synthetic profile or the user profile right there. We're only accessing the profile. We need, so the solution is to just move. So take a look. Let me share my screen.

2:08:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Like the whole world, what we're solving, I feel like you kind of tunnel vision too much on what we're on the typing issue. The, what we're trying to do here is, is set this profile to either be from the synthetic profile or the profile list. That's what we were doing up here. So we were trying to set up. We're trying to do this and make it a variable, but instead we're just going to copy this and then paste it here. This profile here will either be from the synthetic profiles or the profiles.

2:09:01 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. Well, I thought it can be.

2:09:18 - Jorge Lewis 
One thing we need to be careful of that maybe is that if there's any properties of these two that if profiles has something that synthetic profiles doesn't, then there might be an error at some point. I don't think so.

2:09:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Because it has copy paste.

2:09:39 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's the same. I copy pasted the same.

2:09:42 - Hasnain sayyed 
It has all of the properties.

2:09:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

2:09:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Cool. All right. So I'll just push this in.

2:10:02 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, go ahead and pull. And yeah, I'm a hop off. It's been a great session. I think very productive.

2:10:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think we learned a lot.

2:10:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So for now, I guess just keep working on this and then, um, and then, yeah, keep me updated. So it's clear what the objectives are, right. And how we should move forward with this.

2:10:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. So for now, uh, we will be using the loop, right. Uh, for, uh, iterating for the 10 times.

2:10:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Or should I create a function? OK.

2:10:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Just do that for now. And then once we can see something on the screen, then we'll move forward. We need to do it step by step, because it's a very big issue that most new developers have, is that they try to make the whole application And then it takes them three months and within that three months they never finish something that they can test. Not test as in make unit tests, not test as in no errors. Test as in see the experience so it's very important that we that when we're making these projects and you're developing is you focus on very small things that you can test as an end and you so in this case what we can test as an end user the smallest thing is we can see a AI the synthetic user having a conversation with a chatbot that's all we need like we all we need to see is they can send messages to each other basic that's it hmm And then after we can see that, then we work on expanding it little by little. But it's very important that we see the progress through the testing that like with the end user.

2:11:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. Okay. I will work on this and make it as functional as a basic level and then we can move step by step.

2:11:58 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool.

2:12:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I think you'll have to work with, um, I think you'll have to work with one of the front-end developers to get the front-end for this done. So whether Will or Nazif, kind of bring them both in a call and ask and demonstrate or tell them, hey, we have this new task. How can we go about working on this? Check who's busy or who's not.

2:12:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Okay. I will ask them right now.

2:12:33 - Jorge Lewis 
doing this programming session. Looking forward to the ones to come. I think it's a great way to keep growing.

2:12:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

2:12:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Correct then. I will update you once I will get our achieving done. Okay.

2:12:55 - Jorge Lewis 
All right. Cool. All right. Thanks.

2:12:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Thanks. Bye.""","Hasnain _ Jorge - Pair Programming Transcript (1).txt"

Mon, Aug 5, 2024

3:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
you Hello.

3:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, let's start then.

3:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
You are on mute, I think.

3:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes, I am.

3:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so let's start.

3:56 - Jorge Lewis 
you're leading most of this and I'll kind of be chiming in here and there. Yeah, how does that sound? And I'll kind of, if I see you kind of going down the right path in terms of what we want to get done, I'll just let you know.

4:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Fine, fine.

4:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
So first of all, to designing a graph, the most important thing is the working flow. We have to get it in our mind. We have to understand each agent's responsibilities. And we have to track the users, when the role of the users will come, and which agent will speak first, or which agent comes first. At that time. So while reading to the doc, it is mentioned like the flow for the this approach will be linearly for each agent. Like in every example, the flow has been same.

4:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
While the questions are also replicating the same, like yeah, it will change as per the user, you know, the questions and answers to that particular set. But yeah, we have to do some few short learning for that. So I think the most important thing right now is to design the flow for the graph and the approach that we will be using to design this project.

5:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
So yeah.

5:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Can we go over the documents at a high level? The ones that I think are most important are the developer one, which I think is number 6.

5:49 - Jorge Lewis 
is the most important for us. But I think for the agents, he puts so much content, like it's very comprehensive. So I think we'll be very like, we don't have to ask him a lot of questions. And I think like optimizing the performance of these agents will be really easy because he gives us so much content. Like I could select all and copy this and put in a prompt and the agents I think could do pretty well. Yeah, right.

6:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I've been looking at, so you've gone through all of them, right? Yeah.

6:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I've gone through the simple...

6:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
Mostly, I have gone through the important parts which, you know, developers need. Yeah, surely I have gone through everything, but the key points I've also, you know, noted down to my docs. So that seems to be important for developer perspective.

6:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for me, I haven't gone through the number five, which is the interaction between the agents. I skimmed over the number five, but... Haven't gone deep into it. So you're telling me that in that, that's, that's when you were referring to when you said the examples are pretty, like very similar, like the flow is very similar across all users. Yeah. Right.

7:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
That's the most important, uh, you know, doc for designing the graph, uh, because, uh, we have to track the behavior for each agent. Uh, and you know, when the, their turn is coming.

7:16 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:16 - Jorge Lewis 
One, Question I have, like, I'm just looking at this here, analyst bot, and then the response to the analyst bot is not very specific to the analyst bot. Did you notice that, or? Yeah, yeah, right, right.

7:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
I also thought that it will having some, you know, RAC functionalities, which, you know, giving some external context to the user's answers, which...

7:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well.

7:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Like for example, in landscape, for the example, he says, now let's look at challenges in the market. Every business solves a problem, but there are actually, there are usually obstacles that make it hard for customers. What difficulties do you face? What I was imagining is that the analyst bot would maybe do like a Google search saying, common obstacles for this industry. And then the analyst bot saying, from my research, these are the common obstacles. What do you think? So maybe, I don't know if he forgot that we can do that or... Because right now the analyst bot doesn't seem to be very useful, like it's not analyzing any resources. Let's hop into FigJam and kinda work there. I think the most important thing when going at this is staying without a... Not trying to go in a straight line, but rather like a, like a mind map, just any ideas that pop in. We can, yeah, right, right, right.

8:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Correct. That's what I'm also thinking.

8:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right. Perfect.

8:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay, cool. Let's sort of read AI. Let's, I'm going to share my screen, but we can just work. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure.

9:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, have you seen that dog that I have, uh, you know, created the UVP in the background? That's kind of a rough idea. I was trying. It's not proper.

9:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you, what I want to try to do is having one fig gem file for everything. So could you copy and paste your stuff into the intelligent spec? Okay. Okay.

9:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it. Got it. Just doing that. Thanks. Thanks.

9:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I delete the UVP one because I have already pasted here or let it be we can do it afterwards.

10:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, good idea. All right, so let me put a big line there. We're going to work on the left side of this for now. I'll delete it later.

10:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, by the way, one cool thing I found on LinkedIn this morning was this little card here. If you come to this card I'm highlighting, the purple one. Yeah. So this guy put a comment saying, I don't know what Dita is. Have you heard of this before? Dita Schema?

10:38 - Jorge Lewis 
No.

10:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Neither am I.

10:41 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyways, he was kind of saying, yeah, the basic RAG is outdated already. There's this new technique, which he described in this comment, that is supposed to be a lot better. And I want to try to research more and maybe see if we can implement it. And the idea is that it can do a lot better of a job kind of using resources for an LLM.

11:05 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll keep that up there somewhere. It's just kind of not really relevant yet, but just a note I want to keep.

11:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
I've also heard some memo zero, I think, a Python package for rag.

11:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Memo?

11:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
Memo zero, I think.

11:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
M-E-M-N zero.

11:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
I will find the video. Oh, okay.

11:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, there's there's tons of like, like libraries right now that are being published, like all the different frameworks, like there's hippo rag, there's graph rag. Yeah, a lot of small projects. It's so hard to keep track of all of them.

11:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, but it's not been, I think, present in JavaScript, I think. Yeah, JavaScript.

12:02 - Jorge Lewis 
I did a post on Read.AI. I don't know if you noticed, but I did a post on Read.AI, and I was trying to figure out, what do people think about Python versus TypeScript or JavaScript? And it was pretty good, I think. I was expecting most people to say, oh, no one's going to use TypeScript. But if you think about it, most people The most used language right now is JavaScript. That means if a web developer wanted to learn generative AI, it would be easier for him to do it in TypeScript. Yeah, got it. So that's TypeScript over time. And also because it's more integrated with web projects, hopefully, because of those two reasons, more people will put resources into JavaScript.

12:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Now it's been, you know, uh, increasing the projects and the community is growing, uh, with the JavaScript as well.

12:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

12:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right.

12:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay. So let's, let's see, how can we do this? How, what do you suggest?

13:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, so, yeah, yeah. So have you, uh, read the, you know, uh, the working flow, like, uh, what questions and you know, the users actions will be performing. So I have gone through that. And I have noticed one thing like whenever in that doc, it is mentioned, like, if an agent will asking a question, then the second turn, of course, it will be the user will be answering the next question, right? So it will be like an agent, user, agent, user, and it will be going to the next step, agent, user, agent, user. So every time There is a two-phase. First is the agent. Second is the user. So should I explain my rough idea that basically it's a rough idea we can develop to a more extant level? Yeah. Yeah. So I have thought, as in the structure is showing that agent user, so the router, the user, first of all, the start will be doing with the facilitator, right? So I thought the facilitator, Question will be like, it is invoking first. First of all, the facilitator answer is invoking first, like the introduction part. So we can use that as, you know, call that on the onMount function to whenever the user loads the browser or the website for the first time, it will, you know, add that question directly to the chat interface and it will invoke that first. And then the user can interact while saying the next thing.

14:50 - Jorge Lewis 
As you're going with this, let's make cards. So like say, on load, facilitate FA starts. And then you can just go, try to go real, hopefully you can go fast with this. So you can click, if you hover over the purple, click it. There's like blue dots, so you can go, You can make an error, and it should be really fast, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Try going with that.

15:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
So if I use this on load and FA, or Facilitate Agent, right? So the next step will be the user will be getting their business details.

15:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
And that will be going to this graph. And how I thought is we will be storing the state of each step. There are basically four steps, that is tail, T, A, L, E. So in each tail, in each step, we have a different view shot. Yeah, we have a different view shot and prompt for each agent. So forget about this content creator. But for these three, we have different prompt and different view shot for this four step. So we can do like, we can create a object. And in that object, we can, if I write here, maybe.

16:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
So in that object, we can write here the tail. And over here, it will be another object where it will have some few shots and prompts. So based on each user progresses the next step, it will be dynamically fetching each prompt for each agent. Example, if I have started with T that is tail. So, the my object will try to figure out which prompt should be using should be given to that particular agent or that agent should use that particular right. So, we can use like that.

17:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
Whenever user progresses, you know, to the next step, then the user state will be updating from like tail to like the next one. Yeah. Is aspiration. Oh, my bad. E and A Okay.

17:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
So here it will be having A

17:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
And it will be having a prompt and examples and few short, whatever we have to put there. And that, uh, the agents, uh, with the three, you know, the three agents will have updated that prompt with a aspiration one. And, uh, that's how we can, you know, progress with the third, uh, as, and then the last one. So how the, that sounds to you. So.

18:02 - Jorge Lewis 
One concern I would have with that is, so I actually did, I don't know if you saw my message in Discord, I did the, the document three was like a quick start. I did that for Startino. And what I realized was number one, it was, it was slow. So I think that's what he's trying to help with here. Um, but let me get it. So, uh, let me, let me share my screen. Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, Alright, can you see my whole screen? Yeah, yeah, I can see you now.

18:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so...

18:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So it should be here...

18:44 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I think it's here.

18:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So here, I did the quick start guide for Startino, and I noticed... So I went through this little by little, so I did the T-A-L-E, and then when I was crafting the UVP, I went... Oh, actually, when I was doing the... The elevation, or for example, just any step, I needed to go back to one of the previous steps and actually modify this one, because I had a better understanding of what I was trying to do. Like for example, elevation, it was, what's it trying to do? You're trying to find, why is your company unique? Okay, what makes my company unique is that we're targeting this specific problem, so I added that specific problem.

19:29 - Jorge Lewis 
It wasn't entirely just going from, T-A-L-E. It was kind of a T-A-L, maybe A again, and then L, and then E.

19:41 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

19:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So, with your approach, does it allow for that easily?

19:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
We have to, you know, write the prompts if a user have to go like, yeah, I've thought about the update updation as well. So what about a user, you know, created the UBP and in the docs it's mentioned like if the business progresses and the user needs to update their Then there also needs to be an option to update the thing. So we have to write certain prompts like update or change my business idea or change my this to this. So we have to create an agent which really thinks about the user is talking about updation or change.

20:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
it needs to point to a certain, like this step I am lagging about, because how can we point to a certain four step, like the T-A-L-E, what user is talking about, whether it's T or A or L, what is it? So here we have to write the examples for each and every step.

21:03 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so let's do this. Let's start from the very top and just go, since we're both technical people, I think we might understand it better with the graph. So let's make a graph. Like the actual architecture. So we have the, most likely, let's just start with a supervisor. Let's start with something. 100% change, but let's get something. Should I use circles or what? Let's just use rectangles. Supervisor.

21:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So the supervisor that'll lead to, let's say you have actually let's just take your graph down here. It's good. Yeah.

21:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'll use this.

21:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have a supervisor. So we have the user actually.

21:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
You can make the router as supervisor if you want.

21:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Supervisor.

22:02 - Jorge Lewis 
And then user, so. Okay, so the flow, so let's keep this, let's keep this over here. Let's worry, so this is the cognitive architecture. And then let's do user.

22:27 - Jorge Lewis 
User flow. So the user flow, we know it. He put examples of it on the document. Let's try to put it on onto into graph like on fig gems. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we start with, what do we, what do we usually start with? We start with an intro, right? Kind of Yeah. Right.

22:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, who gives a, I think it's a facility. Actually, can we, yeah, let's, is there a way we can label this box? Or we can color them, we can color code. Okay, so up here we have the colors actually already. So facilitator agent is yellow. Let me, you see the colors right there?

23:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah, I can see.

23:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So the facilitator agent is gonna give the intro and then we're gonna go into, what are we going to?

23:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
We will be getting the user details, the business details from the user, the next.

23:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so let's go gather business details.

23:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, again, there will be the facilitator board, as I can see in the flow.

23:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So actually, let's do let's do.

23:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, I think they call it something else. So, what? Can you describe?

24:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Introduce a utility agent.

24:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Introduce the framework.

24:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Introduce the framework, and then we gather details Yeah, like, what do we gather name and basic business model like we want for business to actually.

24:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
So in the technical terms here, that will be a tool which you know, captures go for edit.

24:39 - Jorge Lewis 
We can worry about making this non-technical and technical.

24:42 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. OK. Fine.

24:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So just maybe up here, we can say, tool to add to a document to a, let's say, user context. Got it. Or user profile. Profile, yeah. Document, something like that.

25:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, nice. And then.

25:11 - Hasnain sayyed 
And then the facilitator will be asking whether, you know, the facilitator will be asking to user, will you want to begin the TAIL framework, like just.

25:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So confirm user is ready, like this, right? Yeah, right, right.

25:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool.

25:33 - Jorge Lewis 
And so, so far, So I think we're, from this step alone, I think I can go from supervise or facilitator. Can I add over here?

25:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
I feel like that needs to be a two parts, while this needs to be a first part of the graph and this needs to be a second part, where both the graph are different. For example, I'm pointing like, The tail framework alone needs to be another graph and this needs to be another one. What do you think?

26:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think that's a good idea.

26:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
We can combine because the tail is a very complex thing, right? Because over here, uh, you know, the prompts and cue shorts and whatever the rag, uh, will be, uh, explicitly in the second one. The first only has a, you know, collection of the user or the business details. So I feel, I agree.

26:40 - Jorge Lewis 
I know that's a good point. So let's do, uh, so these are cognitive, we can use sections. I like sections. They organize things. So cognitive architectures for us. And then we can have a section for this is the tail.

27:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:03 - Jorge Lewis 
And then we'll have a another one for the onboarding graph. Yeah. Got it.

27:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it. Okay.

27:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
So So over here, I feel two agents will be fine. There's no need for the content creator brand.

27:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I don't think so. I think just a facilitator with access to tools and it should be good.

27:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So this graph, so let's make this the same format that we have. You know, when you use a, when you print a graph in, I think like on the documentation, how they print the graphs.

27:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have, so let's use, let's use circles for the agents and then triangles for tools. I think you use a triangle for the tool, right? Somewhere. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, OK, cool. So we have the supervisor and the facilitator agent. We don't need a supervisor, but it's just one agent, right? It's just kind of a one-on-one? Right, right, right.

28:23 - Jorge Lewis 
One-on-one. OK. And then can I add two?

28:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I want to add. So this is kind of a two-way graph. This is very simple here.

28:39 - Jorge Lewis 
We'll have a triangle for update user profile document.

28:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I keep creating a new one there.

29:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

29:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
So this is kind of it.

29:10 - Jorge Lewis 
We can connect this to this.

29:20 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's the introduction. I'm just going to change it to the name using the Google Doc. So we have the welcome introduction.

29:43 - Jorge Lewis 
And then, so after we have that, we have the actual tail UVP creation. This is going to be the complicated one, I think.

30:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
So before, like the previous, as I said, there will be four steps in tail, like not in the implementation, like for the tail, there will be a different prompt, like the object structure that I have shown over here. How does that sound? Like, is it a good idea or should we need to update? Let's see. So we mean like framework letter.

30:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Or just single letter.

30:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm trying to figure out how to call this, but just a single letter from tail. So what is the process? So by suggesting the approach that you mentioned, it's assuming that they're all kind of the, the, the flow is, is, are, are the same. We can use the same flow. Oh, okay.

31:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Is that true?

31:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Like it's relatively the same. So we can use the same graph. Okay.

31:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
So what is, what is the important about this approach is the, you know, the graph will identify like, yeah, the user is in this state or this step, like the T, A, So there won't be any confusion related to miscommunication between two steps. For example, A and A won't be combining to create a new solution. So in this step, we are storing the state for each four different sections. And based on user upgrades to Next, it will try to use that particular one.

32:08 - Jorge Lewis 
One problem with that is, like I mentioned earlier, when I was making my... You can see my screen, right? Yeah, I can see. For example, if I want to go from landscape back to aspiration. For example, landscape, what does it mean again?

32:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
Obstacles or, you know, target.

32:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so obstacles, um, and then aspiration, what are you, what are they?

32:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. So, okay.

32:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So these two are very linked together. For example, these are the obstacles that they face this, uh, let's say, okay.

33:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

33:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so here actually put it down. So this is good. I realized that the obstacles. Should be targeting the aspirations. So for Startino, the aspiration of our customers is to retire early. That's kind of what I got to this. Their aspiration isn't to start a software product. That might be how they retire earlier, but they want to retire earlier. So I realized them not knowing how to outsource development is not necessarily as important as, for example, an obstacle in the way of them retiring early is that they don't want to work five more hours a day at their nine-to-five job. That's a better obstacle. Through this, I realized that these two are so linked together, it might be helpful not to have the system go from L to A or A to L, but rather A plus L at the same time.

34:05 - Jorge Lewis 
So you see what I mean? Or can you explain it more?

34:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
One thing also, we also have to check the user answer as well. So for example, the agent has asked me a question. So what if I type in some irrelevant answer? So it won't need to update. So that also, like in the flow chart, as you can see over here. I have created the flow. This is not a graph, first of all. This is just a flow. So the user will enter up the message. So first, it will check the answer of the user, whether it's correct, whether it fits for that. The question, like the agent has asked me, what's your business is about, for example. And if I type, I am playing cricket, so it's not an answer to that question. So that also we need to figure out.

35:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So, let's dig into why are you suggesting this design. I understand why, but let's get it on paper. So, approach one. So, we separate.

35:31 - Jorge Lewis 
uh, each letter into its own face. Correct. Yeah, let's, let's do, let's do, let me do something here. Let's see. I don't know how to. Okay.

35:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm trying to merge these two things together.

36:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I guess I'm not going to be able to.

36:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have the reasons to make this.

36:24 - Jorge Lewis 
And then reasons not to make this.

36:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is going to be pros and then.

36:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
After this, you know, we can just dry run our approach with a, you know, simple user question answer, like we can dry run our approach as well. So it will get the most of the edge cases solved.

36:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So we separate each letter into its own phase. One reason not to make this is because it makes each letter more independent than each other. The framework should allow more flexibility across letters. It will be in the prose, right?

37:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

37:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
It will be in the pros.

37:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
This content will be in the pros.

37:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So actually this, so making them more independent is not a pro or con. That's actually what it does. Oh, OK. Yeah.

37:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
So that's a good point.

37:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me see if I can do. No.

37:52 - Jorge Lewis 
So reasons to make this is when they're more independent, the agents can focus more on each letter.

38:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Hopefully providing better output. Or each step, we can say. Oh yeah, each step to write better output.

38:19 - Jorge Lewis 
But then if they're, when they're more independent, the agents can't, or have a harder time Referencing and moving between. What else? So when they're more independent, there's actually This list of reasons why we're making it separate is actually a very common list. It's the same reason why you want to use a specialized agent instead of a general agent.

39:14 - Jorge Lewis 
It's kind of similar to the approach of specialized versus non-specialized. Let me see if I can find something on it. I don't need this. I got all of that.

39:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so far, what do you think? How are you leaning? I have a direction I'm leaning, but I want to hear your idea.

40:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
I think...

40:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
What if we add a... Or the state management agent, but I want to try run specifically, you know, to track the user like first.

40:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
Do you have any, another idea or any updation for this agent, like for this graph? Sorry.

40:34 - Jorge Lewis 
So for this graph, what I think is, I think it's better we use, we have all of the letters or the steps in one graph and have the facilitator in charge of determining, okay, we're in the T phase or we're in the L phase. And that way it's not explicit in the graph. It's not like, okay, you can only stay in this T phase, but it's more right now, okay, right now we're looking at the T phase, but if the user says, Actually, I think my company values this more and then the facilitator bot will understand, okay, we're actually in the A and L phase. So it's not only just A or L, it can be both, right? And I don't think we're going to suffer too much quality by having them all together since there's different ways we can make them specialized. So for example, the facilitator bot has to understand what each step is and what they're representing. But he doesn't need to understand the best way to answer responses. We can use few shot for that, like you said, for each specific step. We can have it so that the graph is still the same, but we give them enough tools and context to tackle each step properly.

41:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
You mean like pointing to a single step, we can combine steps like like that?

42:02 - Jorge Lewis 
yeah because like for example so let's say I'm doing step a and I have something I like and then I do l and then I'm like okay how about actually I don't like what I wrote for a so I'm going to write something new and you kind of want to you're in the middle of both uh both steps you want to and I don't think it's the bot shouldn't reply okay well let's go back to a and change that and go back to l I think it's better it's more natural the the the bot just understands, okay, let's change your aspiration a bit and then we can move back to L. Do you see what I'm trying to say? Got it, got it.

42:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
So yeah, yeah, I got like a point in my mind, like we have to add an agent over here, like it's just a approach we have to, you know, just a common idea that came. The agent will have a previous like the previous answers of the user okay and whatever the user is trying to answer the next one it will try to relate that yes it will try to find the previous answer would be a better like it can be better if user you know try to write it so it will suggest like in the next question or in the next step, like you have entered this answer for this step, for example, for the T, you have answered this question, which can be, you know, better if you add like, it will add a suggestion, it will give suggestions after the user will complete that step based on the, you know, user history or the user chat, like basic, what do you think?

43:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think that's important. One thing that we have to make sure is that the output of each step is not like stone. They're just kind of to help the end goal, which is the UVP.

44:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, got it, got it. Yeah, yeah.

44:07 - Jorge Lewis 
For example, we can even finish all of the steps and we're going to craft the UVP, and then we realize, oh, actually, when you put them together, this doesn't lead to this very well. Let's go back and change it. I don't think they want to go back and change it. They just want to change it. So that's another reason why I don't want to change it to each letter being its own phase.

44:29 - Jorge Lewis 
What I'm questioning is, we shouldn't overcomplicate this. Maybe, because for example, like I said from the start, I think if we just copy and paste the whole document for the quick start guide, I think ChatGPT can complete the workshop decently.

44:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
I tried that as well, like creating the graph or creating the design?

44:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

44:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like creating, like copy pasting the, into the chart GPT, you mean like creating the graph or what?

45:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Because, I mean creating the, creating the, or running the workshop, JP told us that He already had a little prototype of a chatbot running this workshop with a user, and he said it was already decent. But now he's just trying to make it more scalable and more with potential multi-agents. So our focus should be the multi-agents and not rather worrying too much about the actual items itself. Because I can copy and paste the entire tail framework to a facilitator agent, and I think he'll do a good job at finishing it. Hmm. But what we want to try to do is make sure that it does number one, an even better job and allows for multiple agents so that we can improve it over time. Like, um, facilitator agent alone can't provide research or it's not going to be able to do it properly. Um, the same for like the other bots. So.

46:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
Or else we can have it here. We can just read.

46:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oops. So over here, it will be a user.

46:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
And over here, it will be an updater. And where is the line? It will be going this. It will be going this.

46:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
So, for example, if first let me try run the thing for the tail just a second. So for the T, the facilitator will keep the question. Let's start by thinking. It will be giving a question for the first step. So the chat history or the object that is storing the user answers will be null, for example, the first step. So the user will enter. OK.

47:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
So that's later. In the first step, actually, we have to add the first step as well. Where is the first row? In the onboarding graph itself, we have to give the first quotient itself, for example.

47:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Let me copy-paste this for you.

47:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
I don't know, it will be coming in the...

47:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
I think I got what you mean.

47:56 - Jorge Lewis 
On the onboarding graph, I added a node for the UV creation. The facilitator agent has to be able to say, okay, we're going to go to the UV creation phase. Yeah, yeah, correct, correct, correct.

48:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
So my concern is the agent will be starting the first step while asking the question. So we have to achieve some solution without the user interaction, like without the API hit or HTTP call in technical terms. The agent needs to give the first step or the first question. So in the onboarding graph, it will be the first question, if I'm not wrong.

48:38 - Jorge Lewis 
There's a couple of different solutions I can think of For example, when the facilitator agent can call, this can be a tool to start the... So for example, instead of just having that as a different graph, it's calling a tool that will... We can call it Start UVP Creation. And what this does, it'll trigger an event so that when this goes back to a... Let me think. So in the middle of here, so it's not actually... We can run...

49:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So in the Adapt, I'm actually running a couple like hard-coded if checks. I'm running like if the user is still onboarding. The switch case, right? Yeah, yeah. So we can just do like a switch case for which graph to use. And then so we might be going into the facilitator agent or we might go to, how do I, we go to the

50:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct.

50:01 - Hasnain sayyed 
This is the base. Yeah. This is what I am also thinking.

50:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

50:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. So we, okay, nice.

50:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is, this is the, these three here is actually the, the introduction graph. Yeah. Or onboarding.

50:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

50:24 - Jorge Lewis 
And now we've kind of made this smaller. And this whole thing is kind of becoming the, just the final.

50:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So we can have UV creation. Um, let's call it creation. Yes.

50:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Creation.

50:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So, all right.

50:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

51:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let's... Okay, so onboarding is pretty simple. Let's think on the UV creation. So we have the different phases of tail. I think the supervisor So actually, yeah, this should say router. Well, let me think.

51:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
What do you think about the other code over here?

51:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah, we kind of stopped explaining that. Can you finish the explanation?

51:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh yeah, yeah.

51:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
So for example, The updater will is basically a rag or whatever you, it will have the chat history or the answers for the previous step, like the step means the T-A-L-E. And whenever user answers the second question, it will try to figure out it will compare basically the first with the second and it will try to get the first if it can be a better because the agent's memory or the database what you will you say it will be updating over the steps for the T it will having the answers or the memory for the target customers that the business is pointing to, right. So in each step, we are achieving certain things for the businesses want or for creating the UVP. So, in the next, the aspiration is, for example, in the next step, the aspiration what a customer wants. So, for example, if I put my first the target as the target customer will be children's and my business is actually a shaving, shaving blade, or whatever you say, a Gillette, example, and I put the first question answer as wrong, like my target customer is children. And in the second about in the aspiration thing, if I try to put like my the aspiration or the customer wants is basically to remove their hair for their beard for example and it will try to compare in the updater state like oh yes in the target you have mentioned like children's and now you are talking about a cream or a blade that removes the beard. So it's uncommon or it's wrong. So it will update the state for to to the target again, and it will try to tell like user to the user like in the previous step, you have entered your target customer has children which is wrong. And now you're talking about beard. Yeah. Yes. Yes.

54:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So what you mentioned is a good like it's it's a real problem. But I think we have to we don't want to overcomplicate this solution, I think the facilitator agent can worry about that. If we can present the information to the facilitator properly, so for example, we can have in the states, we can store variables. So in there, we can store maybe an object like tail. We store a tail object. And this tail object has each step.

54:34 - Jorge Lewis 
And what I think we can do is instead of maybe giving just a text. For example, the end result of each step is text. Why is the box so big?

55:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have, we have the subjects here.

55:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Then instead of doing, so tale to our audience is children or teens with fears. Actually, let's use the examples that he sent. I know, I saw he put a lot of examples. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can stick with those. You can use those as like, as like evaluations when we actually make it as well.

55:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's do web craft solutions.

55:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have it ready?

55:53 - Jorge Lewis 
It's in the root one, right? Yeah, I have it. Yeah, so OK.

56:07 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, this is actually good, important. So, the target isn't, it doesn't have to be, it shouldn't be a state, it shouldn't be a statement. So, for example, you can see where I'm selecting on this target for web, what is it called, web craft or, yeah, web craft.

56:31 - Jorge Lewis 
So, you see where I'm at?

56:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I can see.

56:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So user says, our ideal customer is typically a small business owner, 30-40s. They're running a growing business like a restaurant. They're tech savvy. And he describes this statement. So initially, or a misconception we might have is that we want to store this as the property for the target. But what we should be storing, I believe, is not that, but the conversation. Because look, later down the road, the facilitator bot JP presents, JP shows that we don't want just this statement. We want more. We don't want to know who our target audience is. We want to understand them. We want to know, okay, so what are their hobbies? What do they do in their free time? How many children should they have? Like kind of really understanding your audience is kind of what I'm guessing he's going into here.

57:24 - Jorge Lewis 
The user did share kind of their target audience, but the facilitator bot went further and said, okay, let's paint a picture of what their day looks like, So we need to be storing the response to this new question as well. And we need to figure out a format that we want to do it so that later down the road when the facilitator bot is helping the user craft to the final UVP, we want the facilitator bot to be able to take into account this as well, all this context, not just the ideal customer is this. So one thing to keep in mind as well is this framework, the message history won't be long. It'll be a session of about an hour, maybe two hours at most, I think. So with an hour, I don't think the message history can get very long. And if it does, we can worry about that later. I don't think that's something we should be worrying about now.

58:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have to figure out a way that we can store just kind of this conversation here. Maybe even, we don't need to overcomplicate it, we just test it out and have the facilitator bot, if he can remember, so let's say that T is the first step, so that'll be the furthest in the chat history.

58:45 - Jorge Lewis 
have the bot do like this conversation here, and he says, our typical client starts checking their emails, starts the day with checking emails. If I, at the very end of the conversation, when I'm about to prepare, make the UDP with the chatbot, if I say, state what my client does in the morning, if the chatbot is able to do that accurately, then we should be still to go. But also there's a very big difference with the language model being able to remember something and also being able to use it when it's generating new text. For example, if this fact that their client checks their emails in the morning, if you ask it to remember it, it'll remember it. But when it's generating new text, it's not going to be used as strong in the new text. Does that make sense?

59:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's something to keep in mind as well.

59:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So I recommend we stay as simple as possible because JP already told us and I think I can vouch that this whole framework can be done with one single agent. So we already know we don't need to complicate it. So let's start from there and if we need to, if we notice, Okay, the facilitator bar is losing quality. It's forgetting things. Then we can worry about, okay, how do we reduce its context so that it's remembering the more important things? Like, we don't need to store tool usage, tool messages, and stuff like that. So how should we, so then, maybe, so maybe we don't even need, so I'll, because what I was thinking is we store the object. For T, we store the list of messages relating to discussing the T. But then again, I don't think we want to make it that hard-coded. One message might be related to both the T and the A Maybe it might be related to three of them. I think that's also over-complicating it. Let's try to just do... Let's keep this as simple as possible.

1:01:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So this graph here, so let's remove this. Let's go to the user or the router. Also, now that with JP's new examples, I'm reconsidering the whole design of this, because what this is useful for is, well, actually, wait, let me think.

1:01:26 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it should be fine, actually. We need to make sure, oh, we're missing the, Oh, yeah, we're missing the actual subvisor.

1:01:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Right?

1:01:58 - Hasnain sayyed 
One thing here I want to point is, in the context of multi-agent like the router is passing and running each agent simultaneously and then it will be giving the response to SubVisor. Over in this case, each and every agent has a different functionality or different and responsibilities and it will be asking questions independently or you can say to the user in each step. So, if we try to you know combine each agent response in SubVisor.

1:02:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
it will make the supervisor as complicated because in each step we have to point the supervisor you know this agent needs to invoke first or this agent's response or these questions needs to pick so because it's a linear approach it's a linear UBP framework, if you look at the question answer. So that's why I have not added supervisor. But we can think about how we can fit it into.

1:03:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So from the example, yeah, thanks. So from JP, I think he's, I don't know if he's forgotten or if he's like, because initially, A big benefit of having multi-agents is that it feels like there's multiple people in that conversation. So if I say, I want to target...

1:03:38 - Jorge Lewis 
If the system knows, okay, I'm making a Gillette, like a company like Gillette.

1:03:44 - Jorge Lewis 
If I say, let's say something weird, like let's say I'm targeting people from Japan. Or just follow with me. If we're talking to people from Japan, the analyst agent will take this message and say, okay, let's research relating to this. And then it finds out, oh, Japan people can't grow beards. And so it says that in the message that the subvisor relays, but number one, it's going to be hard to, like the facilitator agents, okay, that was a bad example.

1:04:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like the LLMs know that it'll, You don't understand that naturally, but let's do Because in the JP's doc we have seen the agents will only you know, try to ask questions to the user because The JP has you know listed every agent to ask questions to the user in based on different style or responsibility so If we make this graph as the JP's workflow, the agent will only ask the question based on each step or each tail framework, like aspiration, it will be pointing to that question only, related to that question. It won't have any extra context or any extra tools based on user question to research about.

1:05:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
You got what I'm pointing?

1:05:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:05:29 - Jorge Lewis 
It's weird, because all of the agents in his example have the same job. They're all asking questions. Right, right. Initially, facilitator bot was kind of to manage the conversation, to lead. Which he does here, the facilitator bot always will know. So in A, if you're on the same example in the web craft solutions example, A is started by facilitator bot, which is normal.

1:06:02 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what I expect.

1:06:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Then in L, analyst bot starts it. Makes me think, what's the facilitator bot's purpose? I think what JP did was he simulated the conversation from one person. I think maybe we proposed to JP saying, because it doesn't look like we need multiple agents here.

1:06:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Right.

1:06:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's just changing the name of the bot and doing the same thing, like asking questions.

1:06:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah.

1:06:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So what we can do with that actually is do like a...

1:06:48 - Jorge Lewis 
is have all these agents, so this facilitator agent is actually going to be useless and we have these three agents and all of these are kind of have the same purpose as the facilitator agent but they have their own approaches or their own specialties and we have a supervisor just as standard that determines okay this this question can be asked by this agents, but they're all kind of the same. Like, uh, I mean, but also by the way, we might not want to spend too much time thinking this out because the fastest approach might be trying something, sending it to JP and he's like, Oh, that's great. And it turns out it was just the easiest solution. Cause if we make something and he's like, actually I want this behavior more than it'll be. We would have wasted the time planning rather than just making something. I want our AI developers to be skilled enough in that one day, maybe even half a day, we can make this entire graph and then publish it and show it to JP. I think that's very doable. For example, if we're able to reuse the rag tools, the the few-shot prompting, all the things we learn, not only reusing code, but reusing our experience, then I think we could make these graphs super fast. So what we should prioritize is more prototyping and making prototypes and sending that to JP and showing him the results of that, and then iterating from there. And that's the whole Agile Have you gone into Agile? Do you know what it is and what it stands for?

1:08:29 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, Agile is a software engineering framework which basically means developing and testing and deploying, if I'm not wrong.

1:08:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see my screen on Google Maze? Yes.

1:08:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's the Agile Manifesto. So Agile was created because software development was terrible.

1:09:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is the Agile Manifesto. It was created by a bunch of dudes that were like, alright guys, we need to figure out something to make development better. And this is what you should be reading for when you're trying to figure out how to come, how should you be developing. Of course, you can, this has been, a lot of people like this because it's very accurate. So you can make your own assumptions, of course, over time, but this is what I use. I agree with every point here, I think, or some more than others. But one of them is, I don't know if this is it, there's a better, Let me just use one of these ones. Responding to change. This is kind of number one. Responding to change is referring to instead of planning all the different approaches, let's make one and respond to how we get feedback on it. So getting feedback very, very fast. And that's the idea of sprint. Sprints are too weak. Phases for development, because we're assuming that after the two weeks, something will change in terms of what we're trying to do. Or oftentimes that's the case. That's the idea of sprints. And for us, we can make it one day. One day we make this and we're like, okay, that works. Otherwise, actually, we want more effect of this, so we make a new design. So that's kind of the Agile manifesto. Take a look at it. I sent an article.

1:10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
for the Agile manifesto a year ago.

1:10:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:10:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Read that after, in your own time.

1:10:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so yeah, let's not worry too much about the planning anymore, but it was important that we understood what JP was trying to show.

1:11:02 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll raise this concern to JP now. Our time's up.

1:11:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Sign up starts soon. But bring this concern to JP in the chat and say, Jorge and I went over the document. We were trying to design how we can make the AI stuff and realized that none of the agents have a specific use within the system. They don't, or special, behavior like it's not very unique maybe but then he's gonna he might say that's true but I would like the possibility for later down the road that the agents do that so there's um because this is going to be one of many workshops so we have to keep that in mind like I don't know if you if it was mentioned in one of the videos that you watched but he this is going to be

1:11:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
up to like 300 frameworks so or 300 different frameworks so let's keep that in mind We can keep the question asking for a single agent as well, what you what you have pointed before, that's also a good idea. We can just change the name of the you know, question asking bot or whatever agent and that work will be doing with a single one. And the second will be an analyzer, which simultaneously analyze, you know, the response what user has put or what the user answer has come over here and it will try to analyze is there any wrong thing or is there any irrelevant thing that user has you know put or entered and it will and if it's present if there is a major irrelevant thing like I have pointed before then it will ask user that this is not the case based on the history that you have responded to us. You should, it will be giving some suggestions.

1:13:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:13:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Like one thing that I was, I was imagining that this framework was going to do is like the, the, in the onboarding fit and introduction, the user says, I'm doing a software development company. That's what this web craft is. So I've got the user says, um, I'm Alex, founder of Webcraft Solutions. We're a web development company. Then the facilitator bot will keep this in mind, or the system will keep this in mind, and so that when the, for example, for landscape, this one is important to the market, how the market is positioned. Let's talk about other businesses similar to yours. Who else is offering web development services to small and medium-sized businesses? This, instead, could be the analyst list saying these are the companies. Yeah, I'll just tell you. These are the companies that are similar to yours. From their websites, I see that their mission statement or their kind of like their headline. So if I go to Startino, It searches online software development companies and if it gives us a location, we can use that as well.

1:14:21 - Jorge Lewis 
No, but we can search web development company specializing in creating this. And we get a result and it starts to build up. We scrape it, we say, okay, this company focuses on being both a software development firm and a tech co-founder. They provide The passion, okay, so it understands this and it presents it to the user here.

1:14:44 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what I was thinking the analyst bot would do, but maybe he's trying to simplify it and say, we don't need that right now. Let's not worry about that now. Let's have the user do their own research. Maybe it's beneficial as well for the user to do their own research, to understand it better. Let's ask this misconception with JP, make sure it's clear, and then we can go from there. How about you send a message now, and we can see if we can get a response. You should be awake in about an hour, so I think you'll get an answer then. In the meantime, what I would suggest is... Let's see.

1:15:27 - Jorge Lewis 
What else? Like, if I told you make the graph, or make the AI, component of IntelliAgent, what would you start? What would you start doing?

1:15:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
The coding part?

1:15:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like if I said, OK, go make something, what would you start right now?

1:15:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think the first of all, the main idea or the main work is in the prompting. Right, because each step or each phases has different type of portion, few short and whatever you say. So that's the main part of the programming and main part of the code, whatever you say, the logic.

1:16:13 - Jorge Lewis 
By the way, remember that the prompts are being taken from the front end. So the The prompts should be left to the front end, meaning JP should be modifying them. Is that clear? We don't want our time to be spent improving the quality of the bot's prompts. That's why we have an admin interface for the users. We made that entire interface so that they can spend 10 hours a day improving the prompts. That's something we have to keep in mind. We what we can do is since JP for adapts we I know you guys spent a lot of time improving the prompts, which is not What we what we what we should be doing. That's his job but with JP we can do him the favor and Use all this content that he gave us to write some prompts and start him off as a like he can even do this himself control a or what is it now like if he could take the Yeah, this document, 04, and paste it into our input field for the admin page for the prompts, and he can just keep going from there and see how well it works.

1:17:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
So, yeah, we have to keep that in mind.

1:17:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So far, there's two options we can go down to kind of summarize. Number one, there's a concern that we don't need multiple agents.

1:17:40 - Jorge Lewis 
If we don't need multiple agents, does he want them to feel like different people? Can it be one person?

1:17:50 - Jorge Lewis 
If that's the case, we have this graph here, the UV creation graph. Let me go back.

1:18:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So, the initial graph design with the sub-visor was actually the exact same as this, but I think even better. Are you familiar with the mixture of agents design or experts?

1:18:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like the multi-agent one?

1:18:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So, just the word, when I say mixture of agents or mixture of experts, does it ring a bell?

1:18:39 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like there will be a conversation between agent like the flow can be in any form like that.

1:18:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I asked a question. Did you get that it was a question or?

1:18:53 - Jorge Lewis 
No, can you repeat?

1:18:56 - Jorge Lewis 
I asked the question and then you didn't answer. Did you understand it was a question or no?

1:19:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
The mixture of agent you said, right?

1:19:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I asked, does it ring a bell? Do you know what mixture of experts is?

1:19:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's just yes or no.

1:19:19 - Hasnain sayyed 
Actually, no.

1:19:23 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I'm not trying to check, oh, does he know this or not? There's so many things I don't expect you to know. I'm more happy that you don't know anything and you just want to learn everything. I'm more happy with that than you knowing everything because then you get lazy. If I did my PhD, most people, the problem with you studying a PhD in computer engineering, you feel like there's actually a curve of learning. What's the curve? There's a name for the law. Can you see my screen? Yes.

1:20:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Dunning-Kruger effect.

1:20:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So when you know nothing, and you learn your first steps, you gain a lot of ego. But the experts know that they know nothing, or they know a very little bit of what they need to know, so they're always constantly learning. But there's some point where people learn quite a bit of stuff, and they think, oh, I know everything, and they go on their way. After time, you learn, wow, I really know nothing. There's just always trying to learn. So, if I ever ask you if you know something, don't think it's like a test, by no means. If you don't know it, great, you can learn it now. It's not an issue. So, the mixture of experts is, you can see my screen? Yeah, I can see.

1:20:59 - Jorge Lewis 
This was a model architecture used in the Mistral language model. You're familiar with Mistral, right? Yeah, yeah. So what they did was they had, so it's eight by seven B. The eight is actually eight different modules of the thing. So they had the What they did really was what we're doing here. So they have one module here, one module here, one module here. There's a router that determines, okay, let's use this module, let's use this module, let's use this module, depending on the sentiment and the context of the user's message. So that's what we're doing really here. This model of experts, the idea is that you can combine, number one, you can make faster responses since each of these is specialized, it's smaller. So instead of combining all of them. So it's faster and also what you can do is you can attack, you can use all of the modules and combine the results so that each module can be very specific and then we combine all of them together. That's the idea. Like there's a ton of benefits with this design here where there's three agents giving all of their input and then just combining them together. So for example, the brand agents will think, Every message he gets, he's thinking, okay, how does this affect the brand? The content creator will think, okay, will the customers like how this sound? And then the analyst agent will think, how does the market like this? Those are the three things that they think about. And then when they give the answer, we can maybe make, we can determine, Like, since in the example JP sent, each bullet doesn't really have much of a purpose. So we can even just have it so that the output, we can literally just say, OK, who do you think should? So what we do is, actually, no, let me not do it. Let's make this a square.

1:23:05 - Jorge Lewis 
So pick a persona, or so combine. Combine messages, pick a persona, send. So this here can be the steps that we take to send the message. So it's just, we combine all the messages, take every use, we're not gonna pick one, we're gonna combine them. We're gonna take all the useful aspects, and we just have this guy, this is an agent. So this agent determine, What agent makes the most sense? What agent does this sound like, So if we combine all the messages and make it into a message, who does it sound like, Does it sound like the brand agent? Then we'll just make the brand agent say it. Because for example, here, or where is, no, here. In these messages, the analyst bot is not being very analytical. He's saying something pretty random. So it doesn't really matter too much, I think. Who says it, but rather that it feels like multiple people. So I think what would be good is we go ahead and make this design.

1:24:16 - Jorge Lewis 
We're going to call it mixture of agents.

1:24:21 - Jorge Lewis 
This is going to be the mixture of agents.

1:24:34 - Jorge Lewis 
So try making this design. Like try to spend one day on it the rest of today work on this and try to get something finished And then when we have something that's working we can spend Who knows east on the other the rest of the project we can spend The rest of the day or tomorrow Testing it and figuring it and sending it showing some examples to JP saying this is how it works These are the type of outputs we can get Okay, yeah, because what we need to do is Jonas's job and my job here is to make sure that we don't work on features that don't align with JP's thing. So what we're first going to do is send a message to JP saying, hey, we noticed this with the document you sent. Ask for clarifications. And then we can go through with this. By the way, one thing I would recommend is asking more questions.

1:25:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Just any doubt you have, like if I say something and because obviously I don't plan in advance what I'm saying so sometimes I'm talking about one point and then I might just talk about a random point here and then I might go back to my first point and you might have a question on the start the middle or the end and yeah so if I'm like starting to go on another road you can either stop me and say let's stick to this one or you can ask a question if you're confused at all. Like, okay, are we talking about a new thing here?

1:26:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:26:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So just, I think a practice, even if you don't actually have a question, try asking a question, like more questions. Okay. There's a, there's a, there's a technique used by, um, people that, that are great at conversations, which is summarizing what the other person just said. You, the other person says something and you just say, okay, to understand, or to check that I understood correctly, you mean to say that this and this, and you try to explain what they just said. And that way, it's very good at making sure there's no miscommunication and that both people understand it. And also it makes it feel like you're listening when I'm speaking, and that's super beneficial in conversation.

1:26:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it.

1:26:56 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool.

1:26:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's just clean this up a bit maybe.

1:27:00 - Hasnain sayyed 
So for my thing, I will implementing the graph onto the Node.js thing, Node.js and TypeScript. And yes.

1:27:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's get you and Nazif in a call because I want to get this project set up so that you can start working because there's the meaning that I want to get the super base set up. With the admin page on the front end. Let me show you on Adapt. You can see my screen. Yes. Do you remember the URL? I can't remember.

1:27:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it just Adapt Verso?

1:27:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Adapt Journey Verso.

1:27:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
I will Here's the link. I can't remember which one it is. I have sent it in the chat.

1:28:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, you sent it. OK.

1:28:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Where have you sent it?

1:28:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
In the meeting chat.

1:28:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, in the Google meeting chat.

1:28:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So you're familiar with the add-on pages, right? Yeah.

1:28:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

1:28:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I want to get is I want you and Azif to work together to set up all of the... Just a second.

1:28:58 - Hasnain sayyed 
Your sound is echoing. So can you turn off the mic in gather?

1:29:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, it's in gather.

1:29:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Um, So what I want you guys to do moving forward with Naziv is setting up. So like I said earlier, we don't want to work on things that we don't know that JP wants. So we're still early in planning. But what we can do is setting up the project, kind of just the basics. So like this admin page, so that you can start working with the agents and making sure it's efficient. Because if you have a UI to edit the prompts, I feel like it's a lot more efficient and also setting up the super base so that you can connect to Message like message histories and stuff like that. So you can actually start working. There's obviously workarounds you can take like you can Probably use like a local storage or cash and stuff like that. But let's try to get all that set up today real quick Okay Yeah, I think stand-ups in two minutes And for the message, can you update this, uh, I have send, uh, in the meeting chat, uh, for the JP, should I put, uh, so Jorge and I were working and then was working on the graph design. Um, we have noticed that none of the agents have unique functionalities. Um, So I think it's, so we, let me, I'll write a new version. So we can say Jorge and I were working on the graph design on it. So for him, I don't think he understands graph design. So working on the AI design for the workshop agent flow, we can say. Yeah, there you go. Thank you. We're working on the agent flow for the workshop.

1:31:14 - Jorge Lewis 
And we noticed that none of the agents have, that the agents, it's, it's, um, it's helpful. I don't like to use things like none of, or I like to kind of just because like, it's true. None of them have unique functionalities, but then it's important that we don't, when, when JP, when JP read this, he's going to think something and we have to make sure we try to like predict what he's going to think. So if I say, um, your documentation was too simple. Instead of saying that, if I say, um, I thought your documentation was a little vague. It didn't include all the details I need. That's a lot different, but with the same meaning. Um, and that's an annoying thing you have to worry about with clients and communication, but oh well.

1:32:06 - Jorge Lewis 
And we've noticed the agents don't really have unique functionalities.

1:32:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So help me check, do the agents have like a persona? So is there something, is it clear that they're focusing on something?

1:32:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, like in each step, uh, they are asking a different question based on that particular, uh, state, for example, for the target, they are asking based on that. But, uh, by looking at some of the question, it doesn't seem to be different. Like for that, there was one example that I noticed it was different.

1:32:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, um, there was one message where the, the brand bot says, um, So the brand bot in A for webcaps, he says, we buy products for how they make us feel. So that's what the brand bot is supposed to, that's what branding is. And he lists examples of what their brand should represent. So that's the only example I can see. But that's not functionality, that's kind of just their prompt. We tell their prompt, hey, focus on this. Yeah, so let's maybe mention that. We notice that the agents don't have unique functionalities, just rarely, I'll put in brackets, unique focus points, like the brand, like this.

1:33:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So this, and then you can send the screenshot.

1:33:56 - Jorge Lewis 
You can send the screenshot here. All right, I need to use the restroom. I think it's time for, oh wait, no, we're not having standup anymore. Right, I forgot. Wait, I'll be back, sorry.

1:34:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, where do you have, you have put, okay, yeah, gone.

1:35:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
back.

1:35:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you repeat the last sentence that you have said I didn't got that news was telling about screenshot.

1:36:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah, send send the screenshot I sense here. Let me add you in discord. So you can send this message saying this and then send them the screenshot of the graph or like the message I sent. So look in Discord, you see?

1:36:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, in the intelligent one, right?

1:36:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah.

1:36:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So you said, Jorge and I, you can copy and paste the message. Jorge and I were working on the AI flow for the workshop. We've noticed that the agents don't really have unique functionalities, just rarely unique focus points like this. And I highlighted where the brand is focusing on the brand, which is his job.

1:36:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
I pasted this one. All right, perfect.

1:37:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Hopefully we can get some feedback on that.

1:37:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Should I highlight your message?

1:37:20 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you mean?

1:37:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
You said the second thing, highlighting.

1:37:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I sent a screenshot. And there's a blue text that I highlighted. So you can copy the image and send it.

1:37:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

1:37:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, I haven't looked.

1:38:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

1:38:06 - Unidentified Speaker

1:38:06 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so to review our session here, I think one thing that we could have done better, and this is not only just for the pair programming session, but also in general is worrying, I think we, I think when you're planning things like the graphs, what I think maybe is better for us to go quietly for five minutes to make our own graphs and then come together after like five to 10 minutes and combine the two, because that's what we did for Adapt. We had Bewis, me, Chinmay, and Jonas, four people making different graphs for Adapt. And then that was super helpful because at the end of it we got a really good graph. We compared the graphs saying this graph is better for this and it's worse for this. And we were able to conclude to a really good design. So let's try that exercise. So next time you're working on a graph and you're with another person, try that approach. See how that works.

1:39:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's something we can improve on. Also one thing, so these pair programming sessions are a mix of designing and programming. But we spent an hour and a half, an hour and 40 minutes doing the design. So, and it was also kind of a little bit of a mix between kind of planning the project because we're still so new into this project. So if you don't mind, later today sometime, I'll join you and we can work, I'll join you and we can work on this design that we made. Yeah, yeah. All right, cool. So for this, one thing I want to highlight by the way, I realized it while in the restroom, is that the mixture of agents design can actually, regardless of JP's answer here, if you want single agent or multi-agent or if they do have very specific use cases, regardless of that, we'll be able to make this graph because this graph, depending on how we do the last step, which is do we combine the messages or do we select which ones to send? And if we combine them, who do we want to speak? Do we want it to be one persona? There's so many different things we can do with this. So really, regardless of his answer, I think this graph will be what we use. Maybe we can change it or we can prototype with another design, but I think this design is pretty reliable. So what do you think?

1:40:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, we can try on this thing, we can find some much more edge cases as well. But this is much more flexible, I think.

1:41:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, cool.

1:41:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, get started on that.

1:41:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me know if there's any roadblocks or anything like that. I'll be coming around now and then.

1:41:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
For now, should I work on the admin one or should I work on this graph designing?

1:41:25 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you mean the admin one?

1:41:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
The adapt thing you have showed me.

1:41:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you clarify? Like before you have shown me the ADAPT admin panel, like the working for the prompts and agents creation. So should I work on the coding part or should I work on the designing the graph?

1:41:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like a simple thing, what should I do?

1:41:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so there's two things that are to be done. Number one is making the project repository and getting Nazif to help you build the frontend, like a basic version of the frontend, so that you can maybe test something out and you guys can make the super base, you can make it yourself or you can ask him, I don't know. And then that's Or, and or, both of them, is making the mixture of agents design.

1:42:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:42:32 - Jorge Lewis 
You can, what I'd recommend, so to, okay, how about this? So making the front end, or if you were to do the front end within the z first and getting the super base done, it would allow you to test and connect it to the database and use the front end more efficiently. But what I want to try doing is, only working in the TypeScript environment and seeing how fast you can get something to work there. For the prompts, try not to work too much on that. Spend at most 30 minutes trying to get it. Copy and paste as much as possible saying, here's a document describing the framework or blah, blah, blah. Yeah, so try that.

1:43:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Today, right now, it is around noon for you, 12, right?

1:43:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you going for lunch soon? Like in one hour. Alright, so start working on the coding, on the graph, the mixture of agents. Mixture of agents. You can work on that. And I'll stop by maybe two or three times just to make sure things are going great. Okay.

1:43:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I like, I'll join you for like, okay, okay, great, great. Should I create the Node.js repository or should I ask Nazeeb to create the first frontend and then because that will be taking much more time, right?

1:44:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, let's bring Nazif over.

1:44:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to end the Google Meet and we can hop in together. Yeah, yeah, sure.""","Hasnain _ Jorge - Pair Programming Transcript (2).txt"

Wed, Aug 7, 2024

0:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So, we're building the company brain project. The point of this is to combine all of our resources into a chatbot, pretty much. We have all these sources here. We're going to have our gathered conversations, so whether it's a minute or an hour, our Google Meets, Google Calendar, and our Notion, as well as anything else we can get our hands on and put into our storage of We're putting it as a Discord bot, just to reduce the front-end scope. And yeah, long term, ideally, if it works great for us, which I hope it will, then we can be able to sell it, since this will be saving a lot of time, it'll be providing a lot of value. It's not technically too innovative, it's just kind of combining things here and there, connecting to things, and then lastly, using some AI stuff. Yeah, so we have to figure out who should work on this.

0:57 - Jorge Lewis 
To start us off, I'll be leading it. I'll be spending some time in the development, but probably not a lot, depending on how much other stuff I have to work on.

1:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas is out of the picture, he's going to be working on the spec as well.

1:13 - Jorge Lewis 
The other considerations we have... Adapts that we're working on, IntelliAgent is no longer going to be work done right now. It's going to be paused until Jonas finishes that POC. So, how do we do this?

1:37 - Jorge Lewis 
It's fine if I head out for lunch now, and then we can sync back up after.

1:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay, I'll see you guys. I'll send a nice GIF on the Twitch channel to say hi. So, what I would like to do, since this is mostly a kind of back-end problem, we don't have to worry about any Svelte stuff. I think, and since Biwas, how does it sound to you? We put you on this project, and then Hasnain, maybe depending on how we try to format and organize, adapt, then we can put you on this as well.

2:14 - Biwas bhandari 
yeah for me it's okay pretty much because right now i've been tasked to run the adept mobile spec version or something like that so this project is in no rush um I believe so the for the read for the

2:35 - Jorge Lewis 
gather aspect by the way um since gather doesn't have a build or I don't think it has the api um if even if it does we're not going to use it meaning For that, we're going to, where is the

2:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
file?

2:52 - Biwas bhandari 
Sorry, where's the

2:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Actually, we can do like this. In gather, we'll just talk about this stuff. And when we have to do something like brainstorming or any other, we can just come to Google Meet.

3:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Because you said that actually, it makes me believe I missed the point when explaining it. The point of this is to make it really kind of natural to interact with our data. Because if we have to go into a Google Meet every time, that's three minutes, I would say, of kind of setting it up, saying, hey, let's go into a Google Meet, setting it all up, adding the read AI. Those three minutes for me and for you guys is expensive on a daily basis. Not only that is is the read AI currently. I don't it's not connected to any chat bot. So I can't Access we can't none of us can access the resources there. So if I wanted to do slash ask what's be with the schedule? Ideally gives me be with the schedule from that screenshot that you sent a while back and all of our chats So that is to make this really intuitive and make it zero work for all of us to have to worry about adding a a note-taking bot. So for gather, since we don't want to use the API, we're going to add a server with instances of gather running. So those will just be bots scattered around the gather office. And you just join them automatically, and it starts note-taking and adding it to the database. We'll have someone else. I think Leon, Nazif, you remember Leon? Leon will be, you're muted, but yeah. So I think we'll have Leon working on this if he's interested. So this is more what he likes to do, which is architecture. But yeah, so we'll start with Bebos. Bebos, I'll onboard you sometime. I understand you have that ADAPT task for mobile thing. And then for Nazif, we're going to have to figure out the plan for ADAPT sometime later. I'm going to go off for lunch now.

4:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Sounds good.

4:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, also we need to share the IntelliAgent flow with Jonas, just so he has it in mind.

5:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I think what I would like to do is have Since for adapt, I want to go I want to get into a group call with everyone for sorry So Nazif Chinmay has nine and will four of you guys and see if there's enough things that we can do on that project to have four people But from the adapt spec we can take a look and see that I There's not too many AI features, so I don't know if we need two AI developers on that project. So it can take some planning. I'll wait until Xinmei's feeling better. We can discuss that. Well, I'm going to go out for lunch now. I'm really hungry. I will give you an update in a bit.

5:50 - Unidentified Speaker

Hello, there's a boy dude, can you hear me? Yeah back in back in Hong Kong I can see Yeah, I've been here a month world tour is over No, it's just good.

0:44 - Jorge Lewis 
It just got started. That was a little preseason.

0:47 - Jared Cairns 
Let's go home then. Where's next?

0:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Next, probably China for a little bit. I want to practice my Chinese.

0:56 - Jared Cairns 
Nice.

0:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. What about you? Where's next for you?

1:01 - Jared Cairns 
I'll probably be, most of my team is in New Zealand right now, but it sounds like they want us to all go to Taiwan next month. Yeah, and then I'll be in Kenya in November. And then I don't know after that, yeah.

1:19 - Jorge Lewis 
What are you doing in Kenya?

1:21 - Jared Cairns 
We're doing a safari type thing.

1:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, with your girlfriend?

1:25 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, my girlfriend and I are going, and then a bunch of like a group that she's gone on a bunch of these with. I've never done it, so it'll be new for me.

1:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice, have fun.

1:36 - Jorge Lewis 
My parents would probably recommend Tanzania. They went there for their anniversary. It was great, they said.

1:42 - Jared Cairns 
I'm sure we'll be crossing over into there. Yeah, it's kind of on the border, I think.

1:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, we did a website for a safari company, actually.

1:51 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, really? What was their name?

1:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Papta Safaris.

1:54 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, crap. It would have been funny if it was that one. That's cool, though.

2:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll just send you a link here.

2:04 - Jorge Lewis 
We made that website, we made our business as we made that website. Pretty fun.

2:12 - Jared Cairns 
No shit, oh that's cool. Oh the website looks good.

2:20 - Jorge Lewis 
If you're near Southeast Asia, like in New Zealand or in Taiwan, probably pretty easy to stop by.

2:28 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, if they send me to Taiwan, I'm going to probably try to make it to Hong Kong anyways. I'll just be over there, probably take a couple extra days. Either go there or go to a different country maybe.

2:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:37 - Jared Cairns 
So I'll keep you in the loop. Yeah, cool.

2:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So how's it been with the, so it's an acquisition or?

2:45 - Jared Cairns 
Well, I can't say too much, but there's a couple of different directions it can go, basically. Okay.

2:52 - Jorge Lewis 
And the company you work at is a startup?

2:56 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I mean, biotech's weird because you can have a company that's 10 people, and you can go from being worth like $50 million to $500 million with one data report. It's just kind of insane how it works out. But it's technically a startup. It's like 20 people. But most people are not in San Diego.

3:20 - Jorge Lewis 
How's that with time zones? What's that? How's that with the time zones? How is it for work?

3:26 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, it's not bad. It is funny, though, because I mean, just lately, there's been so much traveling, almost all the board is in basically every board member lives in China. Most of the management team is either Chinese, we have one person who's Vietnamese, and then like, they've been traveling. So like, just to kind of do the rounds, all the VCs and everybody they're talking to, like our CMO, who's medical doctor, He was in North Carolina, East Coast United States, went to Singapore, Taiwan, now he's in New Zealand, and then he's coming back to North Carolina, so their travel schedules are just ridiculous, but they pretty much make it work.

4:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the production done in China?

4:10 - Jared Cairns 
So right now, there's no production. Early stage biotech is weird. Well, I should say there's some production of the drug, but it's not for revenue. It's basically just you know, 50-pound batches for clinical trials. So there's some production in China, yeah.

4:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm hoping to look into the China markets, because what we do in China is pretty... I don't know, I feel like it's... I have a unique...

4:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm lucky. I can speak some Chinese, so I feel like I'd be able to connect the East to the West, hopefully.

4:40 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. In Hong Kong, Is it mostly Chinese, but people speak English too?

4:47 - Jorge Lewis 
It's honestly mostly English. All the business is mostly English. The Cantonese, there's Cantonese, which some people, like I say, in the big enterprises, probably within teams they speak Cantonese. But at a company level, it's probably English.

5:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, gotcha.

5:07 - Jared Cairns 
And Cantonese is way different from Mandarin, like there's not really a lot of crossover.

5:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. The characters are the same, but the pronunciation of it are... Some words sound the same, but some are completely different. Oh, okay.

5:22 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, it's pretty annoying. Were you taught it in school growing up there? Like, after you transferred, or did you just pick it up?

5:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I grew up here from when I was 12, and... 12. No, sorry, 6. When I was between 6 12, we learned Mandarin in Cantonese. Mandarin and Cantonese, okay.

5:43 - Jared Cairns 
And all my friends were Cantonese, so I was like- You're like six, I'm just trying to figure this shit out.

5:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so, but what ended up happening was I learned, well, I actually learned both, but I learned Cantonese dominantly in that time.

5:56 - Jorge Lewis 
And then in secondary, unfortunately, I didn't really learn anything new because I went to a local primary school and then an international secondary school, so the Chinese was like, dad, mom, one, two, three, four, five. Oh, gotcha, yeah. Unfortunate, but- Yeah.

6:14 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think, I mean, that alone is a big leg up. That's cool, though. I mean, there's just there's so much market opportunity in China.

6:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, that's what I'm thinking. A lot of growing superpower.

6:23 - Jared Cairns 
Plus, they have like 4x the people that the U.S. Has. A lot of Western countries, they have like 10x the population.

6:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Although, I think they have deflation right now there.

6:35 - Jared Cairns 
Well, they're going through a major recession, basically, due to like, well, they're going to, I think that the CCP is going to end up propping up that residential real estate company, but they're kind of in a crisis. I mean, they have a lot of, the government holds onto a lot of local debt. It's kind of a mess. Like there's a lot of different shit going on there.

6:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Interesting stuff.

6:56 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, well, what's, I mean, there's opportunity. That's what I'd say. There's always opportunity.

7:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. Um, yeah, so oak, oak, um, how's, there's been a lot of iteration going back and forth the past couple of weeks.

7:18 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. A lot of, I mean, a lot of this stuff you guys have fixed and it's working perfectly. I mean, this is really like the last couple of items now, um, related to, So I sent, I just sent it up or a response basically about, so I gave myself that role as admin to be the reviewer of the contract and try to send feedback in, like update the dates or whatever. And I don't know if it's just a browser issue, but I basically turned the review mode on. I went to send that review to myself and it didn't, it doesn't activate the button or maybe it is and there's no animation, but I'm not getting the email either.

7:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Is, is the button like, does it look clickable?

7:57 - Jared Cairns 
It looks clickable, yeah. Here, I can show you real quick too. Let me see, make sure I'm doing that.

8:06 - Jared Cairns 
Okay. Can you see this now? It's loading. Yeah.

8:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, yeah.

8:15 - Jared Cairns 
So like if I am in here as myself, so I set up a new contract just to name myself the owner so this email would go to me. So Basically, this is the newest one, this contract 37. If I go into contract review mode, and then I were to say, OK, I want to send 37 get an update from this, from myself, and I go to click this, nothing happens, which wouldn't be that weird. But I was expecting something in here.

8:43 - Jared Cairns 
And this one, I know the other ones are working, because I got this one when it was signed. Yeah, can I see the screen again? Oh, sorry, this one, yeah.

8:59 - Jared Cairns 
But adding myself an admin was really easy, so that works well. But I'm wondering if it doesn't like it. If maybe this is a feature issue, or because I have multiple roles, it doesn't like it.

9:11 - Jorge Lewis 
What's that? Try selecting multiple contracts.

9:14 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, let's try that.

9:18 - Jared Cairns 
Let me refresh and just try it.

9:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe it might be something wrong with our email server, but very unlikely.

9:27 - Jared Cairns 
I don't think so, because This one just sent to me. Yeah, I just approved this one today.

9:38 - Jared Cairns 
It might just be like on click or whatever this thing not triggering because I think the emails work.

9:49 - Jorge Lewis 
If you could open the inspect mode, like if you right click and then anywhere, just right click.

9:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, it's down here.

10:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:02 - Jorge Lewis 
And then console on the top, the top bar over there.

10:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Nah. Oh wait. Click request reviews again.

10:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah, okay. Let me screenshot that one sec.

10:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Interesting.

10:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, So it was working like an hour ago, right?

10:33 - Jared Cairns 
So this was the process to actually get the contract signed. So it goes into this report. This is like taking the approved contracts and sending them back out for review. So this one I hadn't tested before. Um, so I didn't, I didn't think that I could add my, the, like, I didn't think to add myself with admin to my own role.

10:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So I did that, that worked.

10:52 - Jared Cairns 
Um, but this part I think is where it just doesn't.

10:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you try refreshing the page and then doing it?

10:57 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, let me try again.

11:03 - Jared Cairns 
This mode, and also let's just say two.

11:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

11:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no clue. I'll have, I'll- No worries.

11:24 - Jared Cairns 
No worries there.

11:25 - Jorge Lewis 
And then- Echo's up.

11:27 - Jared Cairns 
Let'S see where this is at too. So if we go right here. So this one's 8-1. That looks right. So I think he just updated this. I haven't looked at it yet, but this does look like it's correct now. Yeah, this looks like it's working now.

11:47 - Jared Cairns 
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, Times OK, yeah, I think this is working now. In terms of Kagan, it's accrual bound, so that's right.

12:03 - Jared Cairns 
And then let's see what his last notes were.

12:09 - Jared Cairns 
All right, yeah, I just need to check that out of the bill number two. Let me check this. This should just allow me to add a bill, and there should be.

12:31 - Jared Cairns 
This looks like this works too. Let me try to submit it.

12:42 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, looks like that's good now. Yeah. So I think we're getting, we're getting really close.

13:08 - Jared Cairns 
Cause I do think the more I've been thinking about it, the more I'm, I'm like, I think these are, I think you could literally as like the company that I'm working for now has been like desperate to have a system sort of like this. I feel like even if you just, if you took all this away and you literally just had this to organize stuff, you could still sell it to somebody. It's kind of the, the, the vibe that I'm getting. Cause like this, I think we'll take. This is, this is good, but it'll take so long to get like really perfect and really reliable. Um, just for every weird edge use case that comes up, same with this, like to make every person happy about how these calculate and dealing with mid months and doing all this other shit, just this alone, just, just having a system that has approvals, contracts. Repository searchable bar right here where you can say what's on my contracts for this person What are all my contracts for you know, let's see 75,000 Active whatever so I'm thinking that'll be the angle first because this is good But I just think it's gonna take time to get people to buy in because it's such a high risk area But I think it's it's sellable just with this right here Okay.

14:36 - Jorge Lewis 
And what do you, so you think we, we kind of hide that feature until we can develop it further or.

14:43 - Jared Cairns 
I'm wondering if we do it.

14:47 - Jared Cairns 
It annoys me cause it's so, it works in like, it works in 80, 90% of cases every single time. But the thing people are gonna complain about are the five or 10% times it doesn't work because they have some weird unique contract that.

15:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so in, in, We technically built a product. Usually MVPs are very barebone. The principle is that we build something, we call it on our side, for the code side, we call it working crap. Code that doesn't show up. And the idea is that we kind of want to get complaints and problems because it shows that whatever, everything else is working to their satisfaction, but we have points for improvement. Points for improvement means that we can improve already.

15:33 - Jared Cairns 
That's smart.

15:34 - Jorge Lewis 
And they're already paying us money, so we know they're going to continue paying money. If we add this new feature, they might even pay more money. If not, we can guarantee that they'll still be paying us money. And it's also important to stay focused on who you're trying to target. So I think your problem is mostly on, so for example, you sell this to one company, this company for 90% of their use cases, it'll work, but 10% of the time it won't, right?

15:59 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, and I would say like the thing that like this contracts part this 100% of time it works. It's perfect. It's exactly what they need. If they wanted to say I want not only this feature. So like the original problem I'm trying to solve was have a CLM that's affordable that that's achieved. They can they can hold all your contracts that's achieved. They can also simplify this reporting for these external contracts, get the feedback from people, track it all in one place, make it auditable, do your basically adjustments for you. That's most of the way there. Those are so important. They get audited by these hundreds of thousands of dollar firms that people can't rely on it. I don't know if to get that to 100% reliability is such an uplift. I don't even know if it's worth it. You know what I mean? That could be a more long term goal.

16:52 - Jorge Lewis 
There's also one thing that I think we could have done better when doing this project, which is focusing on one thing first, shipping that, and then building anything out. Initially, we did decide to just do the contracts first, but I think we ended up kind of, okay, the bills are very useful, so we'll put them in. But I think what we should have done is just say, okay, the contracts is the selling point of this.

17:15 - Jared Cairns 
I think you're right.

17:16 - Jorge Lewis 
People will buy it if it's just the contracts. Maybe more will buy if there's bills as well.

17:20 - Jared Cairns 
I think you're, I think you're right. I think like, yeah, if we were to do this again, just make like the best version of a contract workflow software. That's so easy and so simple. Although I really don't think this is that far off, to be honest. Like I think this is extremely usable. It's easy to understand. It's easy. Like it's easy to flow through and say, this is the contract I want to look at. And then you get a description right here. You can look at this at the bottom. Um, So I don't think it's, I just don't think it's that far off. But yeah, I think like that, that's the next step. So I've been reaching out, although my people have been fucking me over, but I, I'm going to reach out and just start getting, well, let me ask you this. Is there like any, there wouldn't be any issue with giving other users, other people, the logins to go in and just say like, run through this, test it out as if you were using it. Um, submit a contract, just tell me what you like, tell me what you don't like, If I were to give them the logins we have, or should we have new ones?

18:22 - Jorge Lewis 
We can make new ones. We can make new ones.

18:25 - Jared Cairns 
Or they could probably just sign up, right? Actually, now that I think about it, that could be an interest. We could just have them sign up.

18:30 - Jorge Lewis 
The only thing is they'd have to make some dummy data themselves, which might be a little bit annoying.

18:35 - Jared Cairns 
So because when they log in, it's just going to be completely blank. They can't log into this share. Oh, because they're a new email, not in this group, right? Yeah. Not in this organization. Oh wait, we could add them to- Can I add them in here? I can add them, right?

18:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think so. Oh yeah.

18:51 - Jared Cairns 
It's so funny, I'm just like, duh, we like talked about specific with this. And I'm like trying to do the hard way. I guess, because how would I do it?

19:06 - Jared Cairns 
Users, and then it's usually there'd be like an add.

19:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

19:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you?

19:15 - Jared Cairns 
That's a good idea. Maybe I'll do that. I'll just send Pete, cause then it'll be easy. I'll just say, check your inbox, look in here, submit something. Tell me what you liked and what you don't like,

19:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but where's the add button?

19:26 - Jared Cairns 
I just gave myself admin. So let me log out and maybe that's what it is. Let me try.

19:39 - Jared Cairns 
Let me make sure that I'm still, Oh, finance employees. Sorry. Sorry.

19:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, what I recommend is using looms and doing live demos as well. Because you have this and it's working, there might be some touch-ups that you need to do, but they don't need to know that there's still touch-ups needed to do. You can say, hey, I've got this product ready, do you mind if I demo it to you? You demo it to them live.

20:09 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, we're really close to that. The stuff I'm doing right now is just to be nitpicky because I've been on these 15 demos at least and they're the questions that I would ask or poke and prod at.

20:20 - Jorge Lewis 
It's going to be so easy for you to sell or at least a lot easier because you know the exact problems you're solving. For example, for us, and just for our sales that we're doing, for people like you, entrepreneurs, or people that wanna build their own SaaS product, it's hard for me to understand exactly the phrases you guys use for your problems and stuff like that without asking you guys. But for you, you're the customer that you're targeting, so when you're the customer, it's just super easy. It makes everything else just fall into place.

20:52 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, okay, so I didn't know, I didn't think about that. I'll do that next, and then, Yeah, I do think that might be the That might be the play honestly start with just this and say this is these features maybe How many people like right now if you had to

21:11 - Jorge Lewis 
email people to demo how many people would that be? I Could probably I feel like I could confidently get 25 people okay, so maybe a strat is make a like a a second loom of just saying, Hey, I've got this app. Um, here's like a quick outline of it. You go through the features saying, here's the contracts where you can do the very basic, like you just described the very basic things. And then you say, you know, reach out if you want to look at a live demo and that way, because if you send an email, I don't know if it'll get enough of their attention. Oh, another CLM, you know, maybe.

21:48 - Jared Cairns 
Oh yeah, definitely. I mean, I would probably personally talk to all these people or send them a text as well. Um, but yeah, definitely.

21:57 - Jared Cairns 
I feel like that'll be next for the iterations of this, but I do think nice thing is you basically have global search. You have links that you can click through. You have the descriptions in here that are editable. You have a workflow that works. You have PDFs. I think the one thing, and you probably already told me about this. Did we ever look at, um, and I know I said it was a nice to have the e-sign capability. Is that something that is, Like, is there like a DocuSign plugin or something? And I know I told you, don't worry about that. But did you look at what the uplift would be at getting something like that on board? I think we did. De-signature for Chrome. I wonder if.

22:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So one question I have for you is, what does DocuSign do exactly? Because for me, an e-signature, all it is is putting ink on the paper. And then the thing that's legally binding is things like email, when you email those.

23:10 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, lots of emails can be legally, but really any kind of confirmatory agreement to consideration is legally binding. But DocuSign, really, I'm just using this like a shorthand for eSignature. DocuSign is just the most common one in the US. There's probably a different one in Hong Kong or whatever. But in reality, they're just creating a file. You're giving you a nice UI to actually sign it. It's making sure you don't miss any place to sign by marking all the areas you need to sign in a contract. And then when it's done, it's basically sending you a record of which server it bounced off of, what time, I don't know, global coordinates or something. Um, and then just keeping that record that you signed at this time.

23:57 - Jared Cairns 
But I'm wondering if there's a plugin we could use. I mean, this isn't that big of a deal. I mean, a lot of systems don't have the sign.

24:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know if it's exactly a plugin, but they do have an API, which makes like it usually pretty easy.

24:13 - Jared Cairns 
Um, yeah, that's not, it's so, Doing a DocuSign is what we call it here. It's so ubiquitous and easy that it's not a big deal.

24:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's an easy add on top. The signing part is the easy part, but there's a lot of things that DocuSign does that make it great. Things like authentication. I don't know how that would work on that.

24:40 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, and if it wasn't included in here at all, and you just had to get a signed contract outside the system, and that's your attachment when you put it in here, I don't think that would be the end of the world either. I think the one thing, would it be easy on a finalized, and maybe you can do this already. Would it be easy on a finalized contract? I'm just thinking out loud. Like let's say I submit this contract, it goes through the approvals and it's signed, final approved. But the actual signature, so it's approved to spend, but the actual signature comes in later. Later.

25:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

25:17 - Jared Cairns 
Could I attach that? I just want, like, could I just attach another document onto a proof record? Is that something that it wouldn't like it?

25:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, I mean, we could make it work, like, technical, but legally, I don't think you can do that, right? Like, I think actually, that's just another.

25:34 - Jared Cairns 
I mean, it's just another. I mean, legally would be really the legal. What's in here, like there would be nothing legally binding, really, what would be legal would be outside the system. This is more for your own tracking.

25:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. Okay.

25:47 - Jared Cairns 
Um, this is just to say, like, dropping it in the folder after. Yeah.

25:53 - Jorge Lewis 
So wait, the signature and the kind of approved are technically one in the same.

25:57 - Jared Cairns 
Because, yeah. So what I'm what I'm getting at is some companies before they send it out for signature, would want to say, has everybody approved this before we send it out to sign? Has everybody looked at this, which this system would be kind of their replacement for like sending emails and doing a lot of manual shit. So go like approval, approval, approval. It's confirmed. Send it out to sign. I agree with that. But at that point, we have a locked record. And then we have after the fact comes a signed contract. And then you'd basically be tracking them in two different places again. But if we could take the signed contract and just attach it to the record after it's approved, then you would get around the issue because you would just still have the record in here with the signed contract you export later.

26:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Does that make sense? Yeah, Jonas is bothering me in our virtual office. Yeah, so if we could just add it on, attach the sign one afterwards.

26:57 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I'm wondering if you just have, if there's just another button that's like, you just add a new attachment afterwards on the record. And it's like, you can do it at any time. Because that's really not that big of a deal. You could just have like attachment one attachment.

27:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So the signing isn't actually... I could replace that with like a... I can just attach an image on top of the contract, right? Technically.

27:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the purpose to look at the contract and see like the PDF contract and see, oh, this was approved?

27:33 - Jared Cairns 
When somebody's looking in here, you're saying?

27:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:37 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. So I mean, the ideal, ideal, perfect scenario is You submit a contract that you're happy with and you want to get it approved. You submit it through the system. And then at the final step, what we're right now calling the signer step, that's actually when the e-signature takes place. But like we were saying, that might be difficult to implement. The API might be difficult. So if we exclude that, we just have literally a contract and we're saying, do you approve this yes or no? And they approve it, but there's no signature on it.

28:09 - Jared Cairns 
There's a million ways to get a contract signed electronically that are free, easy, fast, not a big deal.

28:18 - Jared Cairns 
But we'd want a way to track that in here. I think it's more than just adding that PDF of a signature on top. But I guess I'd have to see exactly what qualifies. I think, like you said, The signature is really more of an artifact. Really what matters is like all this electronic documentation of when this process was completed. Yeah. But I think like the signature, you're not going to get around people wanting to see a signed contract form on it. Yeah. Now I don't think, um, and at DTX we had this, basically you just append a new page to the end that has the signature block, but it doesn't, affect the original PDF. Like it doesn't change it. You know what I mean? It basically is like, when you sign it, it's just adding a page on the end, which is, I mean, we ran with it and it was fine. We got acquired. So I don't think that's any issue.

29:14 - Jared Cairns 
Like I said, we had this exact, literally this exact issue at DTX with a system that costs $40,000 a year. Like they didn't have an e-signature to start. Yeah, it's crazy.

29:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, we can also just, we can, we can look into it and then just give you a little quote for that specific feature.

29:36 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. And I know, I know you guys, I know I told you guys not to worry about it and I still don't think it's that big of a deal, but now that we're this close and I can see everything working, I'm wondering if it's just something that's not a big deal to implement or if it's something that takes a little work and not a lot of work, if it might as well just add it on just to avoid that roadblock with people.

29:55 - Jorge Lewis 
The amount of work is kind of, it should be ignoring the fact that you should be moving forward in trying to get people to test this out anyway. The best case scenario is we can develop that, you get users to sign up on the day that we ship this, the new DigiSigning. But it's still a good case, I would say, if you get users to sign up without it. Worst case is we build this and then you don't get users to sign up.

30:22 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. Okay.

30:26 - Jared Cairns 
But yeah, I think like I can show at least one process end to end that works and I can show two that are pretty useful and good. And the thing is, there's multiple layers. Like the first layer that we're looking at that 100% works is a system all by itself. Like there's companies that would pay for this. The additional layers are like big, big value adds that it just takes a lot of optimization to get them 100% right.

30:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that I still think it's one of these systems is that it's kind of annoying. It's like with 99% of it done, it's still not valuable.

31:02 - Jared Cairns 
You need it to be that a hundred percent, which is really annoying because nobody wants to hear like, except it works, except this, or you have to watch out for this.

31:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly.

31:11 - Jared Cairns 
Nice thing is the contracts one slam dunk, like it works. The approvals work, the PDFs work, the tracking works, the numbering works, the auditability works, vendor updating works. So I think that in that sense, we're in a good place. Nice.

31:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I have a question. So regarding your goals with this, so we're charging 500 a month, right? Per org?

31:43 - Jared Cairns 
Yes. Okay.

31:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:48 - Jorge Lewis 
What's your goal for this? Like monthly recurring revenue that you can see in the long term?

31:53 - Jared Cairns 
I mean, my first goal will be 500. But after that, I mean, I don't know, like, I've seen this be a consistent thorn in the side of every, especially life science company I've worked for. I mean, I would like to conservatively say Well, I'll say this like CLM is like a $3 billion a year industry in the US. It's a lot. There's a good amount of money in it. But it's a it's pretty simple, right? Like it's there's not rocket science sending contracts through getting them signed and storing them in an easy to search manner. So I think if you carve out a little piece of that, especially targeting a niche first, I would probably quit doing accounting completely and do this full time if it got to like monthly recurring revenue. So that'd be 20 companies on board. But who knows how long that would take? Yeah. You know what I mean? I think that this, the nice thing about this is it's just something that's scalable. Every company needs, you can't get away from it. There's government. Bodies that force you to do it. There's if you every biotech company wants to get acquired, and this is the first thing they ask for is a list of your contracts.

33:06 - Jared Cairns 
So I just think there's a lot of reasons for people to look for a low cost solution. And then the other the other thing you hear, which I'm also on the other side of is like, all the people that start these companies in life science space, that all they want to do is R&D, which makes sense, like they don't want to spend money on bullshit. Accounting or like legal fees, like it's the bane of their existence. So something that stays like $500 a month is so palatable and so easy to swallow. It's like nothing.

33:34 - Jorge Lewis 
And you can have all your, it's like, I told you literally other CLM systems.

33:40 - Jared Cairns 
I just got two demos in my inbox today. They're 40, one's 45 and one is 40 year.

33:48 - Jared Cairns 
And I mean, there's one called the Gatekeeper CLM. If you have time, you should Google it. But they literally do not do much more than what this system does. I mean, maybe you could charge $10,000, $20,000, whatever a year for shit like this.

34:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And I think at some point, we'd be able to increase a little bit.

34:12 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. And I wouldn't mind increasing, especially as features add on, like if we could get this stuff working, I don't see how you wouldn't increase the price, but I mean, the ideal scenario would be for me is, I mean, the ideal scenario outside of this, just being a company that supports itself is like, okay, you have QuickBooks, which is three or four or 500 bucks a month to do your books. You have this to do all your CLM. To maintain all your contracts and you have your R&D software, but also by the time you're getting to a company at this stage, they also need finance accounting help like that would be the secondary revenue stream is somebody like me could come in and help set up their processes and and catch revenue off that as well as part of my job and then kind of the last piece being like I kind of managing as a PM on a monthly basis because, can you still see my screen? Okay. Nobody wants to do this bullshit every month for sure. This is a huge pain in the ass managing all this stuff. But if you do a bunch of them, it's much easier. Like if you do, if you can focus on it and do it to scale, it's a lot easier. So I can see, The software being the first piece, we get these pieces working really confidently, we could charge more. And then also a service piece where you're actually doing the work of these companies also. That would be the secondary piece where you're like, not only do I do the software, I'll give you the calculations, I'll give you feedback, I'll give you a nice PowerPoint presentation or whatever, I'll enter your bills for you. And it would be like, I don't know, I could see a situation where that's different tiers and packages of doing it.

35:56 - Jared Cairns 
I really do think like, for one, it truly is obscene to charge the amount some of these softwares charge. I can't wrap my head around why they cost so much. I mean, there's a lot of development that goes into it, but I see the functionality is just not that good. And I feel like what they're doing is going way too crazy and trying to make up for all that later. You know what I mean?

36:22 - Jared Cairns 
I feel like they're trying to justify $40,000 year for an approval software when it just doesn't, because they spent $5 million developing something that doesn't work rather than like trying to build something valuable and giving somebody a price that they just can't say no to.

36:43 - Jared Cairns 
But we'll see. I don't know. I've never done this shit before. So hopefully we can get one customer. But the nice thing is like, I feel like I'm in a good place where I understand the issue. I know a good amount of people in the industry and it's not going to hurt my feelings to take feedback that's negative and then just keep iterating and making it better.

37:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yeah, that, that feeling when you get that first customer is going to be great. You're going to be like 500 bucks is nothing, but it's going to feel like, like your yearly salary somehow.

37:15 - Jared Cairns 
Seriously. I mean, I feel like it's a lot of money. You know what I mean? Like for something like, that I mean, I say I created, but really, you guys have done all the work. I'm just giving you some feedback. But really, like it does make you I mean, really to be corny, like it does make you feel good to be like, you know, stop getting gouged by these other companies. Like there's a lot of companies out there that could create good medicine that otherwise like are getting just dominated by these insane administrative costs for software. Like I literally do believe like, there's a lot of innovation to be had if you could cut down a lot of that overhead costs into something that just works. And then, I mean, the third, and actually this just happened to a company in San Diego for a company that has the same type of software, but they just manage clinical trials with drug testing. But they basically created a new industry standard kind of like they basically got with the audit firms who audit all these companies. And of course, you have to get audited. You have to audit four times a year. If you go public, you have to go through a really laborious audit. And then it's every 90 days. There's systems testing. There's all these regulations you have to apply by.

38:32 - Jared Cairns 
But they basically became the new industry standard. They got endorsed by the audit firm. So now everybody's flowing to them. And it basically becomes regulatory capture. Now, you've basically gotten a quasi-government entity to endorse you. And at that point, nobody's going to say no, because they don't want to have a compliance issue. So I feel like there's a lot of angles to go that's down the road. But just starting out, I just feel like there's a lot of upside.

38:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, there is for sure.

39:06 - Jorge Lewis 
One thing I want to touch on is just how we're going to move forward with how we want to iterate and things like that. Because for us, it does take quite a bit of time working on these iterations. These ones that we're working on now, we're including them in the original code just because they're part of what the original project is supposed to be.

39:27 - Jorge Lewis 
But the future ones, so before we discussed a retainer where we give you these a retainer where we give you certain hours that we can work on refinements and things like that, right? I mean, we can discuss that later down the road when we have a better idea of kind of what you think the demand will be. Because there'll probably be a phase where you're kind of grinding out those sales and trying to get something to go through.

39:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Or we can discuss any small features that we might want to add on while you're doing that, things like that. Okay.

40:02 - Jared Cairns 
So what would you guys, so you have I know when we talked originally, I don't think you had any like SaaS clients or SaaS build outs. It's mostly website server maintenance, if I'm understanding right. So what would you, I mean, what would your just operating costs be? And then what would you guys think the uplift would be? Let's say that we're not implementing crazy features. We're more doing general maintenance bug fixes. I know we talked about this before, but just remind me.

40:30 - Jorge Lewis 
It would be less than 500. I'd say expect around 300 400 a month.

40:36 - Jared Cairns 
And that's everything together. That's your fee on top of the air table fee or whatever else.

40:42 - Jorge Lewis 
That's our fee on top. That's like us maintaining it. So if you wanted to go like bunker, let's say it took you, you were expecting it to take 12 months to reach a sale. You could bunker down and take this all into your own hands. We'd give you all the things you need. We're using super base, which is super basins, right? We're using super base.

41:01 - Jared Cairns 
What else we're sell for hosting Yeah, those two I think for hosting Yeah Okay, and then that's gonna be so right now I There's not a lot of external data to hold. It's really kind of our sandbox, but you're still paying for the monthly. Is it going, is it going above and beyond what you'd normally be paying for a subscription? Cause you guys build this stuff out.

41:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it, what do you mean?

41:40 - Jared Cairns 
Like, are there fees you're paying right now specifically for this project you wouldn't otherwise be paying? Like, are you paying hosting fees? Are you paying super based subscription just for Oak? And is that something that, Like let's say, you know first sale like are we gonna need a new subscription or new tier for every person? Like is it a user base thing?

42:02 - Jorge Lewis 
The the cost the cost is gonna be pretty constant and so you reach a point maybe not like We're talking at least a hundred at least a hundred organizations actually wait. No, there's users per Let's say like 500 users then we'd be talking about maybe upgrading some servers, but Okay, so pretty far in the future. Yeah, that would be driving Computers nowadays are just like it's it's just so free like actually I I was on ready the other day and I saw two guys post pretty similar post where it's like I want to build this software how much is the hosting gonna cost me and And I feel like there's this notion that hosting is going to cost you like a few thousand bucks a month when you have five users. I don't know. When you're, I don't know, it's just because nowadays on Vercel, I can't remember the cost per, I think it's probably like 40 bucks per month. And then Superbase 40 as well, I think.

43:03 - Jared Cairns 
Okay. So it's not very much. It's like pretty, pretty reasonable. Yeah.

43:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, if we wanted to hunker down, I think if we, if you didn't pay any of our costs, it would probably be a hundred probably. I think less than a hundred.

43:20 - Jared Cairns 
I could say a hundred dollars a month. If in a world where I'm able to manage all this myself and I just have to pay my vet, pay the vendors. It's a hundred bucks.

43:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yup.

43:29 - Jared Cairns 
Okay. Okay. That's yeah. That's very. And you think that even like, let's say we got to, yeah, 500 users, you think it would still be with 500 users, a hundred dollars a month, or there'd be other scale-up costs we'd want to tackle first?

43:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So Superbase, it was annoying at first because they advertise as a subscription service, but it's actually usage-based as well. And that was super annoying for us because we were like, they charge us 10 extra dollars for nothing. And I was like, I looked into it and I was like, oh, it's because it's actually usage-based. So they do charge you usage-based, but it's very cheap. I would say within $100, I could say $500.

44:07 - Jared Cairns 
At 500 users, you would be looking at No, no, no.

44:15 - Jorge Lewis 
I'd say $100 still. To be safe, let's say $150, $200 most.

44:20 - Jared Cairns 
So really cheap as it scales. So really not an issue at all.

44:24 - Jorge Lewis 
This is not computationally expensive at all. The only thing that's expensive is sending things. Oh, the files actually.

44:34 - Jorge Lewis 
But that's about it. So maybe, yeah, like at 500 users, maybe, I mean, at that point, $500 is nothing. That's like one organization.

44:44 - Jared Cairns 
Is there, tell me how stupid I am here. Is there a way to keep these files?

44:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, we can also self-host Superbase at that point. Like that's what, if we realize, This is costing us too much and we're better off self-hosting it. We can take it into our own servers that we pay, you know, 40 bucks for like insane specs. Then we can do that.

45:06 - Jared Cairns 
Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. I mean, at that point we would be having very different conversations.

45:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, that would be crazy. Which is why we use Superbasin because it's open source. We can yank their whole software and put it on our own server.

45:19 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah.

45:22 - Jared Cairns 
And tell me how stupid I am here. So there is, in terms of the space issue, like, is there any way you're still hosting the entire file, but if you were to compress the file, it doesn't make any difference because the original file is still on that server. Like you're still hosting the original to be accessed at some point later.

45:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, PDFs are pretty small. Um, could you tell me like the size of an average file? I mean, like even a big contract is probably like, I think we're talking a few hundred kilobytes, like maybe three megabytes at most. And at that point, I don't think it's much. And if the contracts, if for example, if the contracts end up being the bottleneck, then we'd look at using a separate content management system, CMS. But yeah, like Superbase is great because they kind of do everything for a pretty very reasonable price.

46:18 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. Okay. Okay, well, I don't think that stuff's a concern then.

46:23 - Jared Cairns 
That shouldn't be any concern. That sounds good then.

46:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Probably the least important thing out of everything we've discussed, but do you have a logo in mind?

46:32 - Jared Cairns 
No, that's a good point. I need to get one designed. Maybe that'll be the next thing I do. Or maybe I'll just do Chad GPT logo to start, honestly.

46:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, Jonas did. All our logos were designed by us, actually. Well, except the new one. Have you seen the new one?

46:49 - Jared Cairns 
The Startino logo?

46:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. It looks good.

46:53 - Jared Cairns 
The rocket ship, right? The green triangle and the purple triangle?

46:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. It looks good. The lady that designed it, it was pretty bad. I had to redo it. I used her design as inspiration and then I designed it myself.

47:08 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, really?

47:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it was pretty unfortunate.

47:11 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, so that is actually your design, basically?

47:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like we were like, okay, let's just pay, you know, a premium price to get this done, you know, very, very smoothly for us. We wanted to kind of get this done really fast and without trouble, but it was, it was quite a bit of trouble, sadly.

47:28 - Jared Cairns 
Really? That's annoying.

47:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a spaceman is actually chat.

47:33 - Jared Cairns 
This right here.

47:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

47:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's good.

47:39 - Jared Cairns 
That's funny. No. Yeah. I need something. I love how simple this is. Like I would love a simpler logo like this. I think those work great nowadays. The best that you can get. Yeah. Um, no, that's, that's been on my mind. It's fun because you engage a different part of your brain kind of by like, you know, artistic stuff. Yeah, no, exactly. Like I was thinking, my brother and I were talking about, um, um, My brother and I were talking about it. He's like, you should create a shirt for Oak and it should be this. Have you seen Run the Jewels, the band? This is basically their logo. He's like, it should be this logo and it should be this one holding a pen and this one holding a contract. And then it says Oak CLM, like it should be on a t-shirt. I was like, that's a fucking sick idea. If we get to that point, I'll make that shirt.

48:33 - Jared Cairns 
But yeah, I know this band is killer if you never listen I'm do they're on the jewels run the jewels are fucking badass I Was thinking kind of like a a Piece of oak viewed from top down like you

48:56 - Jorge Lewis 
chopped up the tree and you look at it top down we can have a Just, I don't know, I feel like that would be very basic, but iconic, because oak.

49:04 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, no, I think that's good. I mean, I feel like you could do something with, you could do something, oh, that doesn't work. You could do something with like, this part of the K could be a tree if you wanted to. I feel like you could do...

49:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah, we could do a wordmark as well, yeah.

49:22 - Jared Cairns 
I mean, how do you...

49:27 - Jorge Lewis 
There's a lot right now. Yeah.

49:29 - Jared Cairns 
Let's see what this does.

49:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I've used that one once.

49:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Just inspiration.

49:44 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. These are like, even if you don't go with one of these, it's like, it gives you so many ideas to bounce off right from the beginning.

49:52 - Jared Cairns 
Actually, I kind of like that. Color scheme right here. This is kind of nice looking. That one's not bad. Look at this one. This is kind of crazy.

50:05 - Jorge Lewis 
That's kind of interesting.

50:07 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I kind of like this one.

50:12 - Jared Cairns 
That one's cool. I like that. That one's good. I like where this logo is at, where it's kind of more Okay.

50:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I cut out or someone cut out.

50:29 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. Can you hear me again?

50:32 - Jorge Lewis 
These people that you're going to be emailing, how old are they and kind of what's their background?

50:36 - Jared Cairns 
So it's all over the place. So I'd have basically people that'd be in the system a lot. So I have some people that I've met, I've managed over the years. So some people would be And then I have people who are middle career who would be approving a lot of this stuff. And then I have, current CEOs, former CEOs, COOs, CMOs, who would be, you know, kind of the final signer or navigating the system looking for approvals or reviewing within the system. So I would be trying to get a kind of a good mix, but mostly people on the lower end of the bracket is because there's more of them.

51:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so yeah, we'd have to look at who are we approaching and then who is the deciding buyer. So is it the CEO that's going to approve? Yeah, let's do it. Or is it going to be, because we need to get it past that first person that we're introducing it to. And then we have to make sure that when they present it to whoever they need to do, that they're like, yeah, this is cool.

51:26 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah.

51:27 - Jorge Lewis 
To align with both those people.

51:29 - Jared Cairns 
This one's kind of cool. Yeah, I think like just getting the feedback first because it is weird. I mean, you end up having to basically get it approved by multiple people, which is the CEO and usually the head of finance. So those two people, most of these companies don't have a head of purchasing or HR or whatever else. So mostly, it would be those two people, which luckily those are the people I've interacted with the most and the people that I know the most of So I think that that will be hopefully good feedback. And then They're also not afraid. Look, this one even has the color scheme.

52:03 - Jorge Lewis 
That one's cool.

52:03 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that one's not bad, actually. Yeah, this is actually pretty decent. Some of the stuff in here. You can definitely find something good. This one's a little tree with a guitar.

52:14 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a nice vibe.

52:18 - Jared Cairns 
But no matter what, I think I can get good feedback from them and just hear how much it sucks.

52:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

52:26 - Jared Cairns 
How much they love it, how much it sucks.

52:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's the way to go. Feedback.

52:33 - Jared Cairns 
This is good. I like how simple this is.

52:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I like the circle. I think the circles is kind of what we're aiming at. The circle's good.

52:43 - Jared Cairns 
This one's good, but it looks like a secret society. It looks like a little community or something.

52:50 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, this website is actually solid. You can definitely find. There's 10,000 in here.

52:56 - Jorge Lewis 
I can definitely remember what I used it for. My brother and I were going to start a, um, a little local business. I was trying to help him kind of help him find his entrepreneurial side. The first, the one that we were using this for was, um, premium haircuts, like at home haircut services. Oh yeah. Oh, that's cool. It was too much of a stretch. Yeah. Last week I was telling him what he should be doing is this new one that we thought of, which is in our local area, everyone has bikes because we're in like kind of a village area. You can't go with cars where the houses are. So everyone has bikes. So offer a service taking those bikes to the bike shop to get repaired because it is so annoying walking your bike from the house to the bike shop.

53:40 - Jared Cairns 
That's a good idea.

53:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we charge them like 10 bucks, maybe even like, yeah, eight bucks per bike, take two at a time. I'd say that's pretty good, especially for a 15 year old kid, you know?

53:51 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that's a good idea.

53:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Partner with the bike shop as well. Tell them, hey, I'll bring you new business. Can I get a cup?

53:57 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, exactly. Look at that. That's hustling.

54:03 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think this one's not bad. Yeah, there's definitely a lot in here that are good. So I think we can find a logo. For now, I'm not worried about it as much, but I'm sure that'll be the feedback that they don't like how plain this is and want something different.

54:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, that logo is from the Tailwind website.

54:29 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, really?

54:30 - Jorge Lewis 
It's what we use for like, it's a styling library, I guess you could call it. Oh, OK.

54:37 - Jared Cairns 
It looks fine to me, shit.

54:39 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know if we can use it though as a main point.

54:42 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, I got you. Trademark infringement.

54:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I have no clue.

54:46 - Jared Cairns 
We should just put something really, we'll put the Nike logo here. And just be like, yeah, this is our original design.

54:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah, that one looks cool. I don't know, it's just so simple, it's like,

55:01 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think that's what I'll do next. So I'm gonna probably, Because if I add a user, I can determine who they report to, right?

55:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

55:13 - Jared Cairns 
And they just have to be somebody that's already created.

55:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the tough thing with B2B. So you're doing B2B. This is a B2B SES. B2B, yeah.

55:23 - Jorge Lewis 
What makes it a lot easier is the sales is a lot easier because you can target them a lot more and there's a more rigid process. You can hire salespeople to do it. The harder part is getting them to test it is so hard because they have to test it. They have to implement it in their company. That's the hard part.

55:41 - Jared Cairns 
I feel like the nice part about this is really what I'm doing is really asking more of a favor from people. I'm cashing in my favors a little bit. It's not it's not a huge uplift to ask somebody to say like try to submit a contract and see and see if it's easy It takes you less than five minutes with this system. It's like to me. I feel like anybody could log into here I almost want to say like blindly go into here I'm not gonna get any instruction and try to submit a contract and let me know if you can figure it out like just to see if the UI is that intuitive or not, which I would say it probably is but I One thing that sucks about developing software is you get so used to the UI that it's normal. It's obvious to you.

56:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It just sucks because you can't not get out of it. You have to find another person again.

56:30 - Jared Cairns 
That's exactly where my head's at. I would say like...

56:39 - Jared Cairns 
I mean it's functional now. The only thing that I could see people saying would be like... Cause every system, every business UI like looks the same now. Like they have the top search bar right here with the highlights and drop down and you select from here and they have the sidebar. This one's a little bit different. Although I think we're following kind of those same design principles, but I think you do get like, you kind of want to make it look unique, but if you make it look too different, they start to think it looks unprofessional. You know what I mean? I mean, I don't think this looks unprofessional, but I think that's the uphill battle that you fight.

57:19 - Jorge Lewis 
You need it to be similar to the things before, so that it's not too new that it makes them uncomfortable. But it has to feel fresh, so that it's like, this is new. This is better.

57:29 - Jared Cairns 
I'm wondering if that... Well, we'll see. I mean, I don't want to bias myself in terms of what the feedback would be. I'll just say, give me any feedback you have.

57:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that pink is actually from our color palette. That was brown at some point.

57:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, wait, no, yeah, you have a total, we made the color palette, I believe, it was kind of like a teal brown.

57:49 - Jared Cairns 
I remember, yeah, you were sending me the

57:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll find that image and I'll bring it up. All right, well, I think I have another call to get to, let me check. Oh, look at you.

58:05 - Jared Cairns 
Wow, what a hustler, dude. Nice.

58:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so.

58:11 - Jared Cairns 
Cool. No worries, man.

58:12 - Jorge Lewis 
It's been great catching up. Hopefully we can have more of these. What do you think?

58:16 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that sounds good. I'll just keep using that same link. That works.

58:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually when you set the appointment, I think there's a toggle for make it a Google Meet, which I think you might've not ticked, but I can schedule it. Does this time every week work for you?

58:39 - Jared Cairns 
What day is it today, Tuesday? Yeah, probably that works.

58:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, we can try maybe like weekly or bi-weekly depending on how things are going. Next week.

58:48 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, this is late enough, I should be good. Yeah, yeah, those should be fine.

58:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so what I want to see from you is you actually reaching out to these people, make a loom or tell them, hey, I've got this demo I want to show you and actually show it to them because if you can show them the value in this, then the buying part is going to be easy for them.

59:05 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think that's the next step. And I think that even with some of these functions that are like, you know, just about there I think that's not that big of a deal right now. Really the overall feedback piece is more important. I think that's what I'll do next.

59:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, one of the hard things about sharing things that aren't done is like you want to impress them but you have to realize that they don't For them, it's not the same as for us. For us, they see something that's functional, they see something that finds value, but for us, we're like, this is our baby, so it's like,

59:39 - Jared Cairns 
Right, no, you're totally right. Yeah, you're totally right. I think that's what's next. I'm going to, I'll probably make the list tonight. Actually, let me ask you, oh, you're late for your next call. I'll send you a message in Discord.

59:53 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a team call, it should be fun.

59:56 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, so basically, when I add a user, Can I add somebody without the emails going out? Can I make that happen later or no? If I don't include their email or is that required field?

1:00:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Try it. I think it's required. So what would be the purpose?

1:00:21 - Jared Cairns 
So I kind of want to set it up where I'm thinking of multiple teams of people and when I send it out, I kind of want to set up all their workflows first, and then email them as a group. It's not really a big deal, but I was just curious if it's something that would work or not.

1:00:37 - Jared Cairns 
It's not a big deal if it doesn't. I'm just curious. I'm going to submit this.

1:00:50 - Jorge Lewis 
The middle ground is just asking the person you're talking to to send you their emails, and you can set it up all for them.

1:00:55 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, it shouldn't be an issue. I was just curious. If I can do that first, but yeah, not a big deal.

1:01:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:01:01 - Jared Cairns 
That'll be my next step. All right.

1:01:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, great, man.

1:01:07 - Jared Cairns 
All right.

1:01:08 - Jorge Lewis 
That sounds good, man. Thanks for your time. I'll talk to you soon.

1:01:10 - Jared Cairns 
That sounds good. Take it easy.

1:01:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks, man.

1:01:13 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, bye.""","Jared Catching up Transcript.txt"

Wed, Aug 28, 2024

0:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool.

0:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
This workshop builder has got me rethinking things.

0:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

0:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when I see some of the Chinmai and Will's interpretation of things, It's heavily influenced by English not being their native language.

0:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
And this is not a criticism of them. That's not what this is about at all. Hopefully, you can see the difference between us trying to prescribe to you what a workshop is versus you giving us the Lego blocks, and then we configure it to our needs.

0:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
And what I've been able to do with the workshop builder in terms of designing the why workshop, I feel that would have taken me weeks to try and convey to one of those guys the nuance of what I was after without me being able just to type it in. And it's not the perfect thing, but it's certainly there. And then I'm looking at this check-in session, and I'm like, Cuan doesn't need to build that. He doesn't need to build the workshop. He just needs to be able to give me the data for the workshop. So if the workshop builder has the ability to pull elements from a database, like give me milestones for user, give me achievements, give me issues, give me the course, suddenly, you've basically enabled us to build workshops with content from a data from someone doing something, which is what I think JP is going to need as well.

2:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I just sort of had this thought and I'm like going, would we be better off? And I'm, I almost need you to confirm this or pull me back from the edge. But it feels like the workshop builder becomes the product that allows us to build Adapt or IntelliAgent rather than you building it. To a point, by the way, because the workshop builder is not going to build the LMS. It's not going to generate the data. But it's doing some of the stuff. Like, if I want to do a check-in session, I should just be able to build it and pull data, as long as the data is there.

2:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does that make sense? What I'm what I'm trying to do. I don't know whether it's very well formed, but I'm just like, it just feels tantalizingly close to allowing me to do this myself, as opposed to me trying to convey to these guys what it needs to do.

3:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

3:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think this is a topic that would be better discussed with George present since he's been mostly running adapts recently. I've seen some demos of what they've been created. And from the demos, it seems to be that they've been focusing on the developing the more unique to adapt or unique to feature features. So like for the milestones, they've been focusing on the functionality behind tracking the milestones for the highest scores.

3:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
streaks and such, they've been focusing on the functionality behind those and not how they're represented in chat, if that makes sense. And all of that work is still working. I'd imagine that would have to be done and then incorporated into the workshop builder for you to work on to create the actual chatting experience.

4:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
I agree. I think there's definitely, there's still adapt stuff. I'm just wondering whether what I don't want to waste money and time on the guys building something like the actual check-in session when I reckon the workshop builder will do that.

4:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Right.

4:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's hard to give a straight answer right now. I don't even know what a straight answer would be.

4:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Fair enough.

4:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, have a think about it. I'm assuming you'll have time with George in the morning before I wake up.

5:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

5:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we just need to make sure that we're doing things sensibly rather than inefficiently. So what's going on? Is the saying going to come over or not? I know there was concerns about there being front end or stuff like that. It just feels like it's sort of stalled too much progress on changes.

5:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
on the workshop builder?

5:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

5:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's, I mean, in mostly today, I've just been in calls before. In the morning, I was in call with George, then got in a call with you, and JP did that workshop. Now I just hopped on to start working on the Workshop Builder. And I went for the FigJam, so you added new stuff. So read through that and added the comments. Did you? Oh, I know.

6:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where's the comments?

6:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
or in the bottom part of the segment's definition. Because...

6:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ah, yeah. So let's talk about that. Hasn't looked at this or hasn't given any feedback, but does it sort of make sense what I was trying to do? I just sort of...

6:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

6:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
I made it up.

6:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, this was exactly what I was requesting to have a workshop with JP and you about. So this is a great start for at least got me thinking, especially the outcome and complete parts. As you can see on the left there, I still don't I don't have a full picture in my head of how we would structure the dynamic transitions between segments to be consistently reliably good, because the more dynamic something is, the less consistent it will be.

6:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so that's where I'm, I mean, in my head and see if this makes sense, right?

7:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
I start a workshop. Makes no difference what it is. Let's use Business Model Canvas, because I know it's something you've done, right?

7:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

7:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
And let's say we have a segment for each of the boxes. So there'd be nine segments, right?

7:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

7:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
As we do the first segment, whatever that is, and we start generating ideas, fundamentally, there is some stuff that we create during a segment. Now, rather than that just being part of the conversation, I think that formally comes out and becomes part of the output of a segment. So the first time you have a segment that has no output, so the agent has to just use the default examples.

7:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, sorry, did I say outputs? I meant outcome and completes. Outputs I totally get.

7:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so I'm going to get there. So outcome is this subjective feeling that I have as a facilitator. It's time to move on to the next one. I have enough clarity on that thing. So for me, the outcome feels that I have enough clarity on the, maybe there's a missing thing here, which is what question are we trying to answer here?

8:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
And maybe that's the purpose or the context or the question to be answered. And once you have, I mean, because the thing about it, when I'm running those workshops, I have a sense of what I'm looking for as an answer before I would move on. Now, I might attack that from a multitude of angles, but I'm fundamentally trying to get them somewhere. Now, that does not mean. So OK, so I think the action prompt is how I do something. But I wonder whether this comes down here.

9:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I commented on the action prompt. Is this the famous instructions of the segment?

9:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
So the instructions that the agent follows during this segment.

9:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, the action prompt is the prompt. It's the instructions that they take in order to do this.

9:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Questions to be answered seems eerily similar to what the purpose of outputs is.

9:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the outputs would be the answers. The question is the question.

9:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, outputs is any formal outputs that need to be, ah, okay. Oh, yes, sorry.

9:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

9:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so, the outcome is achieved, the outcome is achieved when the questions to be answered are answered. The action part is how you go about getting answers to questions.

10:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
How are outcome and questions to be answered different then?

10:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
What is your name is the question to be answered. Jonas is the outcome.

10:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so the user has given their name as the outcome.

10:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so Jonas would be the output. The outcome assessment would be that question has been answered, so the outcome has been achieved. Therefore, I feel that we could move on now.

10:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Not complete, because it might be complete in that case. But in the case of the business model canvas, if this was the value proposition, there's a number of questions that you want to explore in there. You don't just want to do the first one. There'd be lots of them that you'd explore.

11:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
the dynamic element is. So there's a point where you have a segment that's empty, and you have examples that gets you started, gets you going. There's a point at which you feel good enough to move on to the next segment, right? Now, in the process map, where you'd have all your segments, let's say we have nine segments, we would have a recommended flow. We can't just say, do what you want. That doesn't make any sense. As JP said, there will be some form of default. Every workshop I go into, I have a rough idea of what path I want to take. I might not follow it because something might happen, but I have an idea of where I want to go. As I said, I would go from value proposition to customer segments to back to that, to the channels, to the relationship. And I would go around those four boxes for a while. So if I was to do this for that workshop, Segment one will be value proposition. Start here. OK. So there will be a process map that says, start with this segment. We need to have that, right? Afterwards, there will be a facilitator agent that will be going, right, based on the outcome you just said, JP has recommended I now go to customer segments. Do you have anything to challenge that? Nope. Right. Go to step two, our segment. The next segment is customer segment, and you just repeat the process. There are certain questions that need to be answered in this segment. You keep on going around that segment until you've generated outputs that allow the agent to feel comfortable that an outcome has been delivered. Now, the question, this is where I think the challenge becomes, right?

12:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
In real time, so Let's say you do the status. Let's change complete to status. So for example, you could have filled in.

13:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then, for example, something happens in segment two. The facilitator is going, that's now challenged something from a previous segment. This now goes in here and says, challenged. Challenge is the new status.

13:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you're in segment two, if it has challenged any of the previous segments, the next action is to go back, update that one before you move on.

14:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, the difficulty for me there isn't updating the status or how to use the status or technologically how to update it or use it. It's how to identify when it should be updated. So it's to identify when a segment is challenged because where would that be included in the prompt? I'm guessing it's the facilitator that would have to be able to identify when a segment has been challenged. How would it identify that? It feels like going down to a specific tunnel vision solution, if that makes sense.

14:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the two questions I would be asking the facilitator, or I have in my head as a facilitator, has anything happened in this segment that contradicts the previous segment?

15:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Challenges. So for example, if I said the value proposition is we want to sell wheelchairs, And in the customer segments, we're looking at athletes, professional running athletes. I'll have a second. I'd be like going, OK, that's really interesting. Why did you say your value proposition was to sell wheelchairs, but your customer segments are for athletes that are running? Those two things don't feel aligned to me.

15:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm still in segment two, but I'm using the awareness of that. And they're like going, oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. We're also selling runners, our trainers. OK. Now that would go back and update the outputs from the value proposition to say we have two value propositions, wheelchairs and trainers.

15:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Okay, I understand. Yeah, then I have a better understanding. But I think that's something to build upon later, probably as a later step. So important, but not urgent.

16:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think JP would agree with that, because I think he sees each of these segments as being a fluid dance between each of them.

16:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I don't know if you've read my card next today, but I think we should start with making it as simple as possible, where we just give the facilitator a tool which allows it to switch to any segment, and then tell the facilitator about all the segments and when to switch to them. When this is completed, we can build upon it with, for example, adding in a checkbox, which allows you to have a fixed next segment, where this next segment is hard-coded to be this segment, which could be useful for when it's like, get the name of the user, then ask the user what they came from You know that's always going to be the progression. So just to prevent any weirdness with the URL.

17:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
So maybe just read through what I wrote here, then we can discuss after.

17:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
The most dynamic solution would be to give the facilitator a tool which allows it to switch to any segment.

17:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
So in the case of a business model canvas, are you suggesting that we have something called a process map or a process flow, which would have a default sequence of the segments, yes or no?

17:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, but in the second part, tell the facilitator about all the segments and when to switch to them in the facilitator's prompt. You could include that. But I think the process map is something to add on to after this is completed. It's not something to exclude. It's something to add on to after the simple version is completed.

18:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
If we can achieve the same outcome through a prompt in the facilitator, then that's fine. OK. What you're saying is, The facilitator is aware of all segments, and it's given a set of instructions on a potential path through them.

18:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
On a potential path through them, and then because it's so dynamic, because it's a prompt, you can just tell it whatever you want. So you can, in step two, tell it, hey, you can go to actually step five here if this is achieved. That's why I call it the most dynamic solution, because it's a very simple, very dynamic solution. Of course, the disadvantage of that is the consistency of it. So hopefully, we build upon this consistency with all the other parts.

18:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Well, as long as you've got on the reviewing engine where you can say, right, you went. So there's reviewing on the sense of a good prompt or a bad prompt in terms of tone, for example. We might want to have a subset of the review where you're saying you've chosen incorrectly.

19:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you went from one to seven, actually going to six was much better. Here's why. So you're educating it over time, how it goes through the model. Because that then is JP's expertise. That's where you codify expertise.

19:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

19:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if we can give it a default prompt, like you've said there, but then rather than trying to get that prompt right, we can say, run the workshop and go, no, if I was looking at a junior guy or if a door steps to me, hey, teach me how to run a business model Canvas workshop. I'd let him run it, and I'd go, OK, so why did you go there? I would have done this, and here's why. Oh, OK. And then, OK, do it again. OK. And we would just keep on going further and further through the process, and eventually, The boss starts to behave because of me because of all the reviews I've given us Yeah, if we can do that, then I think this process works Yeah.

20:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
So the first thing I was thinking was like, oh yeah, that definitely sounds like something that's already within the system's capabilities. But then I remember that tool calls are pretty fundamentally different. So what we'll have to do is expose tool calls to the review system and also in the chat somehow allow you to see when a tool call was performed and reviewed tool call and correct which step it went to, as an example, or tell it that, hey, you shouldn't have been changing stuff here.

20:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah.

20:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, maybe, but yeah.

20:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll maybe go to technical error, sorry.

20:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that's all right. I think if we've got a prompt and we've got a review, I like your approach because I think the question I'd have is whether we need to segment reviews between process and process content and tone.

21:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know whether it makes a difference, but it might make a difference from an administration point of view.

21:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

21:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think all of those, assuming when you review a message, you make it the most optimal message you could foresee yourself, uh, foresee it being instead of just improving on one thing and always ensuring the improved responses, what you would respond. I think it'll pick up on all those aspects for every single routine.

21:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

21:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then again, so let's say it goes to segment seven and I would then pause it and I would go, no, I would have gone to step six, here's why, do this next. Rerun, go back a step, because we have the step going back a step, and it goes to eight this time. We're like, no, you always go to six. So we would have the ability to keep telling it and reinforcing that. I think that then allows JP to go wherever the hell he wishes.

22:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. And I think for that, you could even say, when it went to step seven, when correcting it, you could go like, hey, you shouldn't have even gone to another step here. You should remain in the current step and say this to proceed with the current step. And that way you'd get both change of procedure, tone, everything, like of how it works. But we, I mean, there could be some potential for like categorizing things in the admin panel where it's like, this is a tool review. This is a just message review. Yeah, I think all of that should be fine. There's no wrong avenue to go on down there where we lock ourselves into anything bad.

23:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Because I think what we're doing here, which I like, is this sense of capability rather than solutions.

23:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I like your approach.

23:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't know what Whisper does, or Super Whisper does, But it seems to be that they've done something in the code that they take the example of a input, which is translated to this output, that that example of the transformation, it takes it very, very seriously. And it really applies it. And when I was going through some stuff with JP earlier on, it was like, I was showing it when I said, do not summarize this event or this step. And it was summarizing it. And he's like, LLMs, when you tell it something that explicit, it should be paying attention to it. So I'm not sure why our solution does not appear to be paying attention to black and white explicit statements.

24:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm not sure either.

24:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think that should be fixed by the review system once it's in place, because then proper examples will be passed, and those examples won't have summarization. So hopefully you won't even need to specify it shouldn't summarize, because the review system is basically the experience it has, the memories it has of doing it before. But it's not really it doing it before, it's you doing it before and correctly.

25:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Not wanting to overcomplicate things, but we're going to get to the point where we have an awful lot of steps and just having a very, very long list becomes very unmanageable.

25:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm wondering whether it's possible to have either just a list of all the steps down the side. You know the way you currently have a list of the workshops? If you're in a workshop, you just have a list of all the steps. You click on a step, and that page is everything to do with that step. And you click on another step that way.

25:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's just a UI implementation. I think any of our developers could do that.

25:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

25:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, especially the front end ones.

25:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
So given where we're going, who else on the team can help you with this?

25:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
For front-end improvements, like you just mentioned, Nazif and Will could easily help. But those front-end issues are pretty cross-project.

26:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's a trivial change. I'm more interested in the logic, putting in the review system, putting in this segment system, Definitely has Naeem.

26:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think he'll be quite a help in implementing the segment system because he's more familiar with implementing tool calling than I am. So giving it the ability to switch to any segment and properly formatting that, he can help with.

26:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Otherwise, I think it's a bit early to select more developers on it because there's not enough foundation to start building up from Once we have more foundation to build up from, it will be easier to delegate.

26:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So given what we've talked about, when should we, I don't really feel So it's that useful for me to spend more time doing the Y Workshop. I've done a happy path. I can play with it a little bit more in case it breaks. But you can see how much time I take of yours talking to you and going down these rabbit holes. And I'm like, is it better just to let you go back, like when you were doing the first week, and say, right, I'm going to go dark for a week. Give me six days, and I'll come back, and I'll give you the next release.

27:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't know. I think these days have been valuable looking at it from like an agile perspective. It's just like I completed the first sprint and now we're doing like a sprint review plus sprint planning.

27:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, so how long, I mean, given these new features that we're talking about, when do you, how much time do you need? Cause I think we really do need the review system and the segment system, those two new things allow us to do an awful lot more.

28:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

28:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's kind of like, there's a lot of problems which are similar, where it's like, either it takes a day or a week. During the first day of implementing it, you really figure out how long it's actually going to take compared to not even having started yet.

28:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, I think this example that I gave in here is probably a good enough layout for a segment to start with. It's got enough components to it, or variables. If we have app plus review.

28:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so just to filter out kind of what's going to be in the first version. I think all of these can be, I don't know which color to use. Is this the correct way?

29:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
All of these would be after a first release, which I present to you. The examples, I don't know if you read my comment, but you won't need to create examples in the prompts at all. Fundamentally, examples should be done for reviews, as reviews are passed as examples in a fundamentally better way. Do you agree with that?

29:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know, so I can't agree or disagree with it. The intention is to give us examples of good transformation. When a customer says this, do this. If the reviewer mechanism allows us to do that in real time, fantastic. Let's take this out. Now, what you might want to have is in a non-editable format, all the examples or the reviews associated with the steps that you can delete it.

30:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

30:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Something like that. That's fine. I do think you need outputs and outcome and status. I'm not sure how we do this without that.

30:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
So those won't be part of a segment. They'll be more part of the facilitator's prompt. Outputs are just like it's, I think, I mean, now I'm just talking about before the next presentable version I give you, not before the final version.

30:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not sure that works because for me, an output is something that you're going to, for example, store in the database as an explicit value that you want to be able to refer and pull up on. I don't know whether you can have the sense of a segment being aware of something from another segment without having that explicit variable filled in.

30:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
The workshops you're running now don't have an output at all.

30:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's design this for the business model canvas.

31:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're doing the value proposition segment, you have the whole chat, right? Something needs to extract from that chat the outputs as the formal contribution of that segment in and amongst the entire stream of chat.

31:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK. That can be the next thing we work on right after the first thing we implement.

31:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I'm not arguing that we shouldn't include it. It's more just like the next version I'll present to you probably won't include this.

31:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I don't. So what would I be able to do with the next version?

31:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
In the next version, it would be the most dynamic solution here. So the facilitator can switch to any segment. And how it decides which segment to switch to will be just through the facilitator's prompt.

32:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

32:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then after that's done working, then we'll be incorporating the ability to, when it decides to switch segments, it'll probably provide the outcome of the set segments along with the switch segment tool call. So it'll be adding it. So just adding it step-by-step instead of trying to do everything in one solution, you won't hear from me in way too long. I want to be able to do it in a step-by-step process where I can come back to you, present it, have discussion, see if we're aligned, everything.

32:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Perfect. This is where we're going. I think we're broadly aligned. You figure out what the quickest way to start giving us new stuff is.

32:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Fair, sounds good.

32:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
And once you've digested and sat on this for a couple of hours, if you could just sort of say, right, I think I'll have something for you Thursday or Friday, what you've already been doing where you just have this update, that would be really good.

33:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely.

33:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sweet, brother. Thank you so much.

33:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, thank you.

33:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Bye.

33:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cheers.

33:12 - Unidentified Speaker

Sat, Aug 17, 2024

2:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Jorge, basically just to run you down on what he's said until now is that he's looking to resign at the other job in conclusion, and that he wants to move over to ours in full time, but he hasn't had the opportunity.

2:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's the gist of it.

2:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, he's not here yet. Yeah, he's currently trying to join.

2:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then he started kind of telling the story from the moment he got the Uber job and was going over it, but then his connection just died at the same time as he was starting. So it's good that you joined so that you can also get the story.

3:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, can you join Google Meet?

3:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Already joining? OK.

3:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, hello.

3:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, how are you? No, the connection seems to be bad. The one on gather was just bad.

3:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll be turning off my gather for now.

3:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, go ahead.

3:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, you were starting to go through the story. Do you want to just summarize what you've said already to me for Jorge, so that he has the context?

4:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

4:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I'll be turning off my camera too, if it's okay, for internet.

4:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
The internet seems to be fine, huh?

4:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, okay.

4:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In which case, just a short summary. I got accepted at this server admin job in around May, and then Jorge contacted me around June, which I was actually not able to respond because I got kidney stones during the first days, but my initial plan back then was to work at Stardino during the times that I'm also working at this other company. I kept it as a secret because In our local culture, working two jobs is often times from the pot, by the employer.

5:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So that's primarily the reason why I kept it as a secret.

5:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, that's where I left off.

5:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
We're already going to be discussing the ways forward, like the schedules.

5:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is it right, Jonas? Yeah.

5:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
You also mentioned that you were planning to resign at the auto company, right?

5:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh yeah, absolutely.

5:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm gonna send the resignation paper either next week, Monday, or next week, Tuesday.

5:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
One of the main issues that we've had with your time here at Cirquino has just been your presence, even during your work hours. You've just seemed like you've been on a different wavelength, like in meetings, you're tired, closing your eyes all the time. Just seemed like you're about to sleep and otherwise just haven't been fully present, if that makes sense.

6:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think I've been called out about it a few times already. I'm pretty aware. And probably it's because of the overwork too. But then again, it kind of feels like I'm saying an excuse. So the way I move forward with it is probably to create a means for me to read the messages better and also connect with the other developers more often.

7:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's possibly my way forward.

7:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Personally, I feel like it's just kind of been the whole situation that's created the circumstances. If you're, as I explained earlier in Gather, if you're working from 7 a.m. In the morning till 9 p.m. In the evening every single weekday, there's no way all of those work hours will be efficient, you're going to be super tired. If you want any free time to spend in your weekdays, then you're going to be either missing hours or missing sleep. And if you're missing sleep on such a schedule where you're working every single hour of the day, you're not going to be working efficiently at all. I think that's the reason why you haven't been present fully.

8:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, other than that, I think one of my issues is I oftentimes lose track if I'm not writing notes of the meetings. That's a habit that I know works, but I don't strictly implement it.

8:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes, what?

8:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Write down notes, like notes of the meeting.

9:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think there's any specific thing like that that's been ditched.

9:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
What do you think, Jorge?

9:11 - Jorge Lewis 
It's like, it's hard to tell because Any behavior that we experienced from you was affected by your other job. So it's like, I can't say, oh, it's this. Oh, no, it's this. Because everything, oh, it's this, we could say it was because of that, but we don't know. So for all I know, my concern is that you leave this other job and you join us full time, and some of those issues still remain. And then we can say, oh, it wasn't because of the other job. It was because of something else.

9:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, good point.

10:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

10:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to think about it.

10:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, it's a bit hard.

10:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I hear what you're saying. It's a bit hard. For us to figure out what's going on or I guess for the both of you to figure out what's going on to see which ones are an issue related to the other company and which ones are just literally behavior related issues.

10:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would argue the other company plays a huge role especially with my activity in from morning to afternoon, not being able to respond to calls, not being able to be up on gather, those things are related to the other companies. However, like the times where I sometimes, I sometimes don't, like, fall too much attention to meetings, like I'm a bit, how do I say it properly, like, lightheaded? Is lightheaded a term?

11:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay.

11:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would argue that even though the other company might play a role there, with all the stress and all the stuff, I'm sensing that it's related to a behavioral tendency of mine to be a little bit lightheaded if I'm not writing down notes. Because this is a behavior I've observed for a long time already.

11:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Are you guys waiting for me or something?

12:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

12:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm just thinking.

12:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Everyone's like thinking. Yeah.

12:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Something you learn doing a lot of meetings is just being comfortable with silence.

12:26 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you think, Jorge?

12:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What are your takeaways?

12:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it'll be a great opportunity for you to grow as a developer, but there's also a risk that in the end it doesn't work out with us and then you'd be left in a bad spot. That's one of my concerns.

13:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
That's fair.

13:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think maybe it's because I'm overconfident in myself, but I honestly think I have the capacity to be hired in another job if everything goes wrong like I'm not that afraid of losing wait wait that sounds wrong I'm not afraid to lose no 30 um I'm not afraid of that prospect because I think it's easy for someone like me to be hired in a simple job like a simple server management a simple network like I'm not afraid of

13:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
losing your house or something.

13:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Basically.

13:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If all else fails, I can always be a fryer at McDonald's.

14:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
That is the way.

14:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
What we really need from people in Startino is a lot of self-initiative, a lot of wanting to move forward.

14:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
taking on responsibility and not relying on others, and I think if you're consumed with another job in addition to this job, and you're trying to optimise your time too much, what happens is you don't have the opportunity to have that self-initiative to over-deliver to take on responsibility to manage yourself, you end up just completing the things that are handed to you, and just that, and it's not in a proper timeframe either.

14:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
As an example, Chen Mei, especially when he started with us, when we got him on, like, and gave him a task. Usually he did the task and then over-delivered on it, looked into new avenues he suggested we go into, like, did a lot for us beyond just the task that we gave him. And that's only something that's possible to do if you have the time to do it. And if you have the mind space to go properly into it, you can't really get into that mind space if you're working a 18 day onto different things.

16:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Seems like well cut out again.

16:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe you can turn off your camera, we'll see if that helps.

17:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, hey, this might be.

18:01 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, the only thing I think is just, if he leaves his other job, there's a chance that he doesn't fit in here, and then he's going to have to find another job.

18:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he didn't seem too concerned over that, so I wouldn't feel that responsibility on my shoulders at least.

18:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, joined with the work account now, I think.

18:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, maybe using my phone will be a bit better.

18:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's sideways for me, but it's clear.

18:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, OK.

18:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, anything that you guys discussed without me?

18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Just to highlight it again, my concern is that we don't want the responsibility or the weight of having to keep you because you have no other job or because you left your other job for 13-0.

19:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
How do I say this?

19:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's not really that bad.

19:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, okay.

19:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here's how I think about the situation. Right now, I have a very... I basically have two options.

19:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I could probably focus more on Stardino.

20:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's a very simple job with not a lot of things to do. But my... But growth there is also minimal. Or I can focus on...

20:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I can focus on Startino, which I honestly believe would be a lot more stressful, but would force me to grow in ways I don't know. I could. I could possibly choose the other job for the sake of stability and some of the government benefits, but I honestly feel like five years down the line with them, or a year down the line with them, I would regret not taking this option because I won't grow as much. You feel me?

21:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And if, let's say, let's say, in a hypothetical universe that I actually don't align with the values in Startino, it's part of the business. At some point, at some point, yeah, there will be major differences that should be resolved immediately.

21:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There's nothing wrong about it, Para. Sorry, Filipino word, Para. Like, it's part of the game.

21:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, sorry if I keep putting in Filipino words.

21:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Only I will understand them. Yeah.

21:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
But basically, my stance is that I would prioritize Tartino mainly because I feel like I would be growing much better as a developer than stay at a typical server management job in a small company in Makati.

22:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah I resonate with that.

22:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
What about you Jorge?

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah I mean I think that's obvious, that's pretty obvious. Yeah.

22:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jorge do you want to hop in another call and just discuss them or want to remain here?

22:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is in Will's court now.

22:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

22:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's basically my court because... I have to make a choice? It's up to you. It's your decision.

22:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, I'm not gonna lie, guys, but like...

23:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although it's in my court, yeah, my decision is to be with Startino. Like, you guys still have the final say. Like, whatever your decision is, I have to respect it. No, not have. I will respect it.

23:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nonetheless.

23:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we don't have much of a decision right now. As you know, we're open for you to join full-time. That's how it was initially. So if you're able to actually be on full-time this time, then yeah, that's the way we would like to go and then see from there.

23:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although, I have a small request, Jorge, if ever I get full-time.

23:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I want to keep the up work, just lower my rate a little bit and to the proper amount of hours. I just realized how much it benefits me by letting me know how much I work for the day and how much hours I'm not actually doing productive things.

24:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, sure.

24:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's not a problem.

24:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I think we're pretty cool on that front.

24:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Would you like, Jonas, to have a little bit longer talk? I mean, a little bit longer coding session on Sunday to compensate the lack of coding we've done for today?

24:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

24:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can do it on Sunday instead.

24:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I was supposed to see Chinmay today, but he's not here.

24:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he's usually not on when you have scheduled pair programming with him.

24:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I see, like, Jorge is supposed to be pair programming with him. Oh, he's not on.

25:01 - Jorge Lewis 
To be fair, I hopped on, like, as it was supposed to start, because I didn't get a notification for this event. So I don't know. He hasn't put a thumbs up, so I think that's why. Yeah.

25:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, is it possible to move the Startino YouTube discussion, like, well, little bit earlier because it's like I prefer to go out for lunch like and it's currently like the right between over nothing that so it's like too early to go now and also it's too close but it's also very late to go oh we could do it later as well if it's Is everyone invited there or is it just the two of you?

25:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can just do it at that time.

25:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just take lunch at like 2pm then, I guess.

25:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know why I'm feeling so tired. I think it's because of the rain. It's been really rainy the past few days. So I'm going to go shower and then...

26:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe we can do it tomorrow?

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Ideally, I don't want to push it back anymore because it's already been quite a while. It's just a discussion. It's like, uh, it can, it can even be like, I mean, it'd probably be like an hour or maybe probably an hour and a half, the whole thing. We can just do it right now.

26:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't have enough energy for it. So if you want, you're on in the evening. Uh, yeah.

26:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think so, yeah. It's just that I'm not very awake during the evenings now because my sleep schedule was thrown back and forth.

26:42 - Jorge Lewis 
After lunch work then?

26:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Tomorrow morning I would. Today evening should work.

26:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
We can do after lunch as well.

27:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I just like to get some programming done then when I'm like awake or so.

27:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we could do tomorrow afternoon like, but like one.

27:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
What's that? So, so like 12.

27:21 - Jorge Lewis 
What time is your lunch on Sundays?

27:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Usually just go out like between 12 and or like 12. Yeah.

27:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
12 to 1.

27:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Usually I'm done with lunch right before stand-up.

27:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's do tomorrow at like 1 your time then, or 1.30ish.

27:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll move it.

27:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sounds good.

27:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll accept it. I'll accept the move. I wonder if Chinmay's gonna get in.

27:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, who put Balloon on my desk?

28:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh that wasn't you?

28:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
I thought it was you.

28:03 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I don't want balloons on my desk. 100% that was Beelze.

28:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Who had the time to put 4 balloons on my desk?

28:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Which one's Beelze's desk? Oh yeah this one.

28:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I tried to reschedule, what happened to it?

28:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Ah, okay, yeah.

28:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, okay, it's rescheduled now, then you get the notification.

28:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
It never asked me if I wanted to send or update it for other...

28:57 - Jorge Lewis 
I haven't gotten a notification, but...

28:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Copy to Jorge, say. For me it's still 1.30. Oh, I just added it to yours. And then...

29:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, now if you look at Sunday 18th, it should be there. 1 to 2 PM for me.

29:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, yeah. 2 to 3.

29:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Guys, is it okay if I early?

29:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
If you what? If I go early?

29:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

29:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Since I think I'm okay already. Do you guys have any questions for me or something?

29:38 - Jorge Lewis 
No, just whenever you can, posting an update about the signup would be good.

29:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, okay, wait, wait, wait.

29:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Good thing you brought that up.

29:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to the updates, I saw your announcement a while ago, but Are you expecting, like...

30:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Ah, okay, okay.

30:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In the channel user sign-up, do you have an expectation for me to provide an explanation still on what's happening on the auth?

30:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Because my initial assumption is that my updates are to be written in status, in the status subchannels.

30:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

30:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
In coordination with Chenmei.

30:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

30:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So put it from our perspective you're working for two days. I have no clue what you're actually developing I can hop in a call Which is which is what I do like here and there but kind of to put like as a baseline It would be good for everybody to be posting what they're working on and like in the technical channel so that I don't have to support them. For example, what I can do is I can spend a 10-minute checkup on everybody twice a day to gather the technical things, what's going on, are they doing the right solution, but then multiply that by three people and that's already a lot of time.

31:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In the Adaptive, I update what I'm working on and the status, I update what's the status for the feature I'm working on. Is that right?

31:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the features that are going to be deployed. It doesn't matter who's working on it.

31:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just what doesn't have to be crafted for current at all. It shouldn't be the problem. The reason has expected it to be is because you've also are us and everyone has been asking questions in the dev channel. We shouldn't be asking him anything in the dev channel. That's just for us. It's supposed to be showing him, Hey, we're working. Look at us. We're chatting. That's basically it. Yeah.

31:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Otherwise, what's in the status channel should be outcome focused. That should be what he can expect when. And it's to set expectations for him so that he knows what to expect when. It's not for him to put pressure on us or anything like that. It's just showing him when he should expect pain.

32:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think that's better.

32:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So basically, from what I'm hearing, we have to post two kinds of updates. One update, what we're working on. Second update, what's the status of the features assigned to us.

32:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
That update is for Jorge. Status updates are for Q&A.

32:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Jorge plus the rest of the team, because like, for example, Chinmay has no clue what you're working on for the signup page, but it would be helpful for him to know. Oh, he's working on the signup page. So when he's done with that, we could hook it up to the whole chat. Like it's just that type of communication is just needed for projects. Kuin sent a message to me in a private chat saying you guys have no overlap between your call times. I put call in bracket because I'm available like 12 hours a day so I just put the times that Kuin can reliably call me. I don't know what your guys' times are. Yeah, wait, let me see.

33:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If I remember correctly, we don't have a lot of overlapping hours too.

33:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have on my calendar when I can be called there's like book a meeting entries which is 11 a.m. To 4 p.m. Is when you can book and then 11 the night to 2 a.m.

33:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
That should be very clear there when you can book with me.

33:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean I didn't respond to him just because like he doesn't need like that is a worry but I'm just gonna tell him, oh, those are the call times. Like for you. I don't know. But it's just like, because we do have enough overlap. Chinmain has nine, have at least like a couple of hours a day.

34:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just show him a screenshot of like your calendar with all the pair of homecomings and meetings between us and say, we meet. We meet each other. So it's just, um, Yeah.

34:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So when do you think you're, let us, I don't want to force you into a final decision now, but when do you think you would have an answer by?

34:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, I don't think I heard this properly. You asked me when signup is ready, right? Or when am I able to be full-time in Startino?

34:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
The latter. Okay. Yeah.

34:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll probably provide you with a definite answer on Tuesday.

35:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Tuesday. Okay.

35:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then Tuesday, you'll let us know. And then from there, if you are going full-time, when could we expect that?

35:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So in typical Filipino companies, resignation happens on a 30-day basis. So you have to render 30 days of service.

35:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
However, I can negotiate.

35:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll probably try to negotiate it to be shorter because that's also possible to be done.

35:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool. Sounds good.

35:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, keep us updated.

35:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sure thing.

35:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right, cool.

35:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Great chat, guys. Jonas, good luck coding, and I'll be back on in like 20 minutes. I'll let you know if you're going for lunch then. I mean, yeah, we'll... Have a nice day, guys.

35:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye-bye. See you.

35:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye-bye.

35:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
At least on his phone.

35:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, on his phone.

36:00 - Jonas Lindberg

23:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hey Jonas.

23:11 - Charan Puvvala 
Hello.

23:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Apologies mate.

23:19 - Charan Puvvala 
Sorry. You just didn't give me the notification. I'm so sorry. My bad. That's okay.

23:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sorry about that. Yeah.

23:29 - Charan Puvvala 
And I don't usually be late to meetings. Yeah, that's okay.

23:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
How are you?

23:38 - Charan Puvvala 
Not too bad. Today is an Indian festival, so my wife is busy doing something. What's the festival called? It's for a Goddess. It's meant for bringing prosperity and wealth.

23:54 - Charan Puvvala 
How are you doing? What's your time zone?

24:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
My timezone is in ICT, in Dunedin, so plus 7.

24:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not too far off yours.

24:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
You're plus 5, 30, right?

24:12 - Charan Puvvala 
No, I live in UK, I live in London. Oh yeah, you live in UK.

24:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we work with a lot of timezones, so it's pretty interesting. It's pretty early for you then, right?

24:25 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah, it's early, it's like 9 a.m. Yeah, so I was just running, getting some stuff.

24:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, and here it's 4 or 3.30 p.m.

24:36 - Charan Puvvala 
Okay, Hong Kong, right? You live in Hong Kong?

24:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I live in Thailand. Thailand, okay. Hong Kong is plus eight, I think.

24:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

24:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's the co-founder, George. Okay, lovely, lovely. Yeah, so.

24:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Let me see.

24:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, for today, I'm just going to present to you and hopefully answer as many of your questions as possible about the task. And then Kuhn will be taking care of budgeting and quotation later. He told me pretty clearly that that's his job, not mine.

25:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Kuhn?

25:18 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah, Kuhn. That's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
He's there in the UK with you. Yeah. Let's see.

25:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll send you a link in chat. Can you see that one?

25:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
I need to log in.

25:52 - Charan Puvvala 
I'Ve requested access. Or you could share your screen. Anything's fine.

25:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, approved. Lovely, sweet.

26:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so basically the one on the left here is the previous infrastructure. It kind of describes how it worked previously, how it was set up. I think I've sent you this one before, right?

26:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

26:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
No, okay.

26:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, oh yeah, I sent you the list of tasks, not the previous infrastructure.

26:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, on the previous infrastructure, the application Hero TMO, you worked on it, right?

26:37 - Charan Puvvala 
Well, not on Hero. I worked on the product before that, but I kind of helped them with some configuration, setting up Nginx, more like infrastructure. Yeah. Do you still have the Nginx config? I don't have it, but I can ask the other guy, the old guy who used to work.

27:00 - Charan Puvvala 
Apart from Jeetu, there was one other backend guy called Akash. He's kind of like, I mean, he was here in UK two years back. He moved back to India. I'm still in touch on WhatsApp. I can kind of just check in and see. It's not hard to set up Nginx. I've done it like multiple times.

27:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, yeah, that's good. Well, yeah, this kind of, tell me if anything is wrong here, but this is kind of outlining how the previous setup was configured.

27:29 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah, PM2, yes, you're right, static folder, yep. Nginx and then a wildcard, yeah.

27:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
That look correct, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So how we're aiming to get it configured is most of these services should be able to be quite easily containerized as I see it. But have you worked with Docker? Yeah. Yeah.

27:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

28:01 - Charan Puvvala 
How do you want to have it, Jonas? Do you want two Dockers or one Docker? I mean, one for the back end, one for the front end or all of them in one?

28:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, which do you think is better?

28:14 - Charan Puvvala 
I think the back-end services and the DB kind of Nginx.

28:23 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah, no, I think, yeah, back-end DB we have along with, I think we can also have them just as one Docker.

28:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, one Docker Compose, but many Dockerfiles, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, if needed, we can separate them out later. But I think it should be easiest to get it all working if it's one Docker component, right? Because then you can take care of the networking in just one.

28:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

28:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

28:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so this is basically the high-level overview.

29:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
The code is as it was before, except we've updated and replaced some packages that have been deprecated and completely deleted from the repositories and replaced them with updated ones. We've got the frontend and websites running separately along with the MongoDB. We're a bit unsure on how the middleware situation works. So you'll probably have to take care of that. But otherwise, we've at least got the MongoDB server running. We've got the frontends running, both the surveys and application.

29:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
The backend, I'm a bit unsure about, and the Nginx, no.

29:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

29:52 - Charan Puvvala 
Do you have the updated, can you add me to the updated repository if you have one?

29:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, one moment.

29:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

30:06 - Charan Puvvala 
Could you send me your GitHub user?

30:09 - Charan Puvvala 
What are you using, Bitbucket or GitHub? We don't, yeah, it's the same email if you can find me. Or else. Yeah.

30:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
I just got a hook up for some two-factor authentication stuff.

30:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
This is my link, yeah.

30:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yep, found you. Lovely.

30:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
The invitation has been sent.

30:51 - Charan Puvvala 
Yep, I'm on that. I need to sign in. I'm going to sign in now.

31:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm on.

31:14 - Charan Puvvala 
Just tell me when you're sent, and then I'll look for some stuff.

31:39 - Charan Puvvala 
Yep, that's it.

31:42 - Charan Puvvala 
Okay, I mean, Hero TMR, Hero Web Services.

31:47 - Charan Puvvala 
Everything's in OneRep, alright? Yeah, everything is there in this repository.

31:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Everything that Jif gave us is here.

31:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay. Sweet.

32:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
In Web Services, you can see there's a Docker Compose inside of this Mongo database and an app called DTestApp1. We aren't completely sure what the DTestApp1 is.

32:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK. Cool.

32:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
You can also see some folders like middlewares and migrations and stuff. So there looks to be an application that was here acting as some sort of middleware, but we are unsure of how it interacts with the rest of the application.

32:33 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah, a lot of this code, right, it's been kind of copied from the previous thing. That was the one that I built. So this middleware, some of it is familiar for me. Some of it is like quite like, I mean, someone else has written it here. So the tenant and all, earlier what we had was, before this I was working with QN on a product called Manicola. Not sure if he's given you some info about it. It was an AI project management tool. So in that he wanted basically some complete isolated tenants for each client. So the data is not shared or things like that. So I can see some of the code from that. Yeah. Okay. I see.

33:14 - Charan Puvvala 
Okay.

33:15 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah. But quite a lot has changed right in the last five years. You can use GraphQL, MongoDB to make it much more simpler.

33:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think we got the version that you had, that you were working on first, because we got an updated version that we started working on and figuring out before we got in a meeting with Jippu, which basically told them, hey, this is a very old version, here's the actual new one.

33:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

33:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, in this new one, the two like main folders is the TFS folder and Hero TMO folder, which is the, let me see what it would be. I think that's the, that's the main like application where the business logic is basically app.hero.tmo one. And then there's the website folder, which is where you sign up and create a company. Yeah.

34:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

34:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
I advise you, like, in your work, you hop on Discord and check out the Hero and Hero-dev channels, because that's where we've been discussing with Kuhn, and there should be a lot of context there to look at.

34:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

34:36 - Charan Puvvala 
You invited me, right, to those channels?

34:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, you're in those channels.

34:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
There you can also get in contact with Kuhn and plan a meeting, sorting out the cost side of things.

34:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

34:59 - Charan Puvvala 
Okay. I'm going to change my password. I need to change it.

35:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Anyway. Yeah. Okay.

35:08 - Charan Puvvala 
Uh, yeah.

35:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Anything else, Jonas?

35:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
You may need to...

35:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
About the previous DNS config and the DNS records and getting access to editing them, you might want to get in contact with Jeff, so he can create a Microsoft account for you to access the It's not Azure, or it's kind of like Azure, but it's called Microsoft 365 Admin.

35:43 - Charan Puvvala 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that.

35:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, yeah, I've done that before. Yeah, you may already have a user there, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:51 - Charan Puvvala 
Cool. So basically, you want me to dockerize everything, yeah? Get it working somewhere, configure the DNS records, and then hand it over, like commit the code, kind of keep it working, that's it, right?

36:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh yeah, exactly.

36:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
And to confirm afterwards, we should be able to take the repository, which you will have committed to, and basically run the Docker Compose. Yeah, I'll commit to the same one on which you've shared.

36:19 - Charan Puvvala 
You're an admin on that, so it should be fine.

36:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

36:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Then, once you're finished, we should be able to take the repository, put it on a virtual machine, run the Docker Compose, fine-tune the DNS records and it should be working.

36:37 - Charan Puvvala 
Sure, no worries. I'll set up a branch called Info or something. I'll keep working on that so that in case you guys are doing something.

36:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
We won't be working on it and if we are working on it, it would be in collaboration with you. So you can just work with that repository however you feel.

36:54 - Charan Puvvala 
Lovely, man. Cool. No worries. Because I own QN1, so I'm going to make sure this is sorted out.

37:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, nice.

37:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, anything else, any questions or anything, just ask me. Yeah, I'll message you on Discord.

37:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, perfect.

37:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Anything else right now? No, that's it.

37:25 - Charan Puvvala 
Perfect. Once again, apologies, mate. I kept you waiting for 20 minutes. That was not good of me.

37:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it was quite convenient today because I was just coding anyway, so I just for 20 more minutes. But yeah, thank you for that. I will hope to see in the future. Have a great day and have a good day with the festival. Yeah, thank you.

37:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cheers. Bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (11).txt"

Mon, Aug 19, 2024

0:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see. Place.

0:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah. They have the most per capita, right? But Texas probably has the most. I don't know. Or China. Wait, no. China is in the state. But yeah. Never mind.

0:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Between.

0:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you say China is a continent?

0:21 - Jorge Lewis 
They're right. Actually, their economy is starting to, they have deflation right now.

0:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow. Didn't Japan have like mandatory deflation for like a while?

0:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, Japan had a big... I think it's still a big issue. Their population is decreasing. Like, how does that happen? That's just...

0:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, do you want the explanation? Because I haven't...

0:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I know the explanation, but it's just like... Do they just watch? Do they make plans for 10 years and then just watch it and don't change?

0:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like, all the politicians, because it's an age of population, all the old people are voting for the people that give old people benefits, and the young people are getting fucked, so they can't get, like, they aren't in a financial

1:14 - Jorge Lewis 
position to get children. But I mean, like, do they not see that? Like, we're talking about, like, probably at least 100 people plus working on this, on, like, these things.

1:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, they aren't getting the votes.

1:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Interesting. New York City is the highest with the Bay Area, Tokyo, Singapore, London, Los Angeles. Millionaires total.

1:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Wow.

1:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:46 - Jorge Lewis 
How's Texas not here? I don't know. My mom was like, Oh, Texas is the most millionaires.

1:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I finally got the motorbike and it's the exact motorbike I've been looking at getting for like two weeks now. So that's nice.

2:05 - Jorge Lewis 
We haven't checked up on the wise has been sent, but I don't know if you've, I don't know what that is looking like,

2:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's arriving tomorrow, right?

2:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Tuesday.

2:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, okay. Tuesday.

2:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, yeah, just, uh, it's fine for now. They're the latest internationally.

2:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Three Texas cities have the most millionaire billionaires among the U.S.

2:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
cities. On the way back, I had to follow the car which the other guy was driving, and going 90 down the freeway on my first drive was not what I had planned. But the thing is, my phone was in his car, so I didn't have my phone. So I just had to book it after him. Because otherwise, I had no shot of getting home.

3:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I'd have to somehow find a corner and ask for help. Was it between Central Festival and Maja, or...?

3:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
It was going from, like, slightly into Old Town to southeast, like way southeast. Oh, okay. Across the bridge and through a bunch of turns and everything. And on the highway, as noted by the 90K. Yeah.

3:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
That was up in the highest gear and all the way pulled back.

3:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Does it have a gearbox, at least?

3:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh yeah, it's a manual. Or, well, it's semi-auto, so no clutch, but gearing and everything.

3:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Those ones without gearboxes just...

3:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, no, it doesn't have a gearbox. I'm just... That's shifting.

3:51 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, how do the... No, but like...

3:54 - Jorge Lewis 
How do they make a stone comfortable? Like, surely... The bolt drivers, you mean?

3:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
They're just shit. Like, they're actual garbage. Like, when I went to the course, they didn't have enough automatics. And I was the last guy in queue, so they just gave me a semi-auto. And I was like, yeah, I wanted to learn this anyway.

4:14 - Jorge Lewis 
When you're driving, you don't feel the... Like, when I was driving the car, when I was learning how to drive the car, like, if I'd make a sharp turn, you don't feel it when you're driving. Because you've got your hands, like, on the wheel and it's just like, you're in the way of the turn. But, like, when you're in the back seat, everyone's like...

4:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but the gear shifting, like, the first was like... Especially when I shifted down, I didn't... It had no gearbox, so the RPM just got translated over and it just... Yeah. It didn't go faster, it just kicked at the same speed. And then I slowly but surely learned how to switch gears with it being better.

5:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
You're muted, I think.

5:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you talking to the others?

5:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello?

5:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
No audio. Can you hear me?

5:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello, hello?

5:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello, hello? Yeah, now I can hear you. You just cut out, and then I saw you just...

5:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
I was trying to...

5:52 - Jorge Lewis 
For the Ferraris and the Lamborghinis, the gearshifts, they just press a button and it just looks cool.

6:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've gotten pretty good at getting the smoothest of gearshifts now though. It's interesting.

6:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Especially shifting down in here. I have to do the perfect braking before shifting.

6:18 - Jorge Lewis 
it just reminds me of like like it just I don't know it's just so fun for me like all that stuff like doing like lamborghini uh stops and just like or not limousines um breaks and stuff like that or stops or whatever yeah um yeah one thing before we go into the topic is So for some, so like we have the mindset of the longterm with some of these guys, like investing into them, but like, since we're so inexperienced with hiring people and kind of their culture in general, and we didn't go to the university ourselves. So it's like pretty, and we just, we're too young as well. We haven't met enough people their age to kind of understand. Okay, do they have the potential? Like for Chinmay, for example, I can see he has good potential. But for someone like Cas9, like for example, the Primogen, what's his real name? I never said it, never.

7:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
But it's out there.

7:37 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyways, that guy, like no one probably thought he was going to be like, oh, the greatest of greats.

7:45 - Jorge Lewis 
so it's like for okay so for the one I'm speaking about is like someone like b was in house nine for them like how does english get better sorry michael it is michael it is michael yeah he has mentioned it michael or at least someone has mentioned it michael yeah and it's for someone like has nine his english is it needs a lot of work um Like, it's just not something that we can take to clients. Um, like it's, it's conversational, but I feel like we should be, we need people that are fluent, like Chinmay and, and I don't know if Biwas is fluent actually, Will's fluent. Um, but anyways, like there's, there's, it's not, so the language is one thing that of course can be learned. Um, but there's also, Like Nazif, he's become as good as he is in English because he spends time improving it. Hassan doesn't really, he just does things on the internet that are inherently English. But there's some behaviors that, like for example, Chinmay and Nazif, I just know I can work with them because they aren't going to tell me, oh, that's a good idea. Like every single time, like they, they participate in conversations. I had a conversation with, with the whole team on, um, on Adapt and it was just me and Chinmay talking like the whole time. Um, like I like Has9. Um, like, of course we get along well, but it just, I feel like there's going to be maybe, like, I just can't see. If there's potential or not. I'm not saying I can't see potential, I'm saying I can't see if there is.

9:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
And also, just from a fundamental standpoint, if we're at the stage in our business where we should be investing in people that we're unsure about for the long term.

9:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and it's like, when you, like, I think there's so many people out there that it's like, if you hire another person, like, or I think The objective way to go about it is you should fire him and look for another one, another one out of college or like another young person.

10:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

10:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
At the motorbike course, I actually met a software engineer. He's in his like 40s now and he's like started two companies. He had like a lot of insight there. And basically he just said, like when he interviews, like he usually rejects like at least five people before he finds one that he deems like fit. If that makes sense.

10:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like that's the minimum.

10:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we did quite a few. We did one-way interviews.

10:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I mean, sorry to elaborate on that, that's bringing them on the team for like, basically like we did, but we accepted every single person. We brought on the team but he just like throws them off the second he sees like okay this isn't it just oh it's not what yeah like for example be worse he's got a great worth ethic and yeah maybe

11:15 - Jorge Lewis 
like because like think about it like this as well when I first started programming I put try statements everywhere I had no clue what I was like, When you first started, you just like, there's different types of people. There's people that start with like good, you know, foundations like Nazif and perhaps yourself. But for someone like me, where I just, I was just like, I'm just the type to just try everything and just like, just the grind. And then you, and then you get to a point where you're, you've learned things.

11:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, I think he is similar to that, because some of the things he figured out with NixOS and the old tech stack, I did not. I straight up tried it for half an hour, just gave it to him, and then he figured it out. He may have taken more time than I would, but he figured it out. He found weird-ass solutions.

12:13 - Jorge Lewis 
I just can't remember back when I first started. I told him to evaluate I'm getting a weird echo or something.

12:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

12:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So I was speaking one, two, three.

12:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, not for me.

12:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so I told him to evaluate the leads or to improve the, the, the rest system. And I told him when you're comparing the results of a, of an analyzer compared to the actual system, he was using an LLM to compare their yes or no, their Boolean value. And I was like, oh, bro, there's no reason, like you've over-engineered it, there's no reason to use LLMs. And he said, hmm, okay, yeah. But then he came to me again and he brought up the same point, but as he was saying it, he realized that I already suggested for him. So I'm trying to figure out, would I make that same mistake in trying to, over-engineer, perhaps, because when you're naive and inexperienced, you just kind of think, oh, the most fanciest solutions. Perhaps it could go over my head that, oh, there's just a property that we compare Boolean. We think of it as common sense now, but maybe that's just in hindsight. I don't know. So it's tough to say, but at the same time, it's like, we're putting money into him in the hopes that he gets better in the long term.

13:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. And also like when they get better, when we like form them into what we need, they may just up and out.

13:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. I mean, as long as there's more potential at Futino than other companies, I think they'll stay, which I think we'd be able to provide with how ambitious we are.

14:10 - Jorge Lewis 
One attribute of Chinmay that is just very clear is that he has goals. I think you were listening in on the part where he knows he wants to improve in terms of salary and everything.

14:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
He wants an American California salary.

14:31 - Jorge Lewis 
I want to tell him in a nice way, unless you go there, you're not going to make that.

14:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Well, that's why he was looking into starting a business, right?

14:42 - Jorge Lewis 
But in, I don't know if he wanted to do it in India or in the US, but they all wanted to start a business by the way.

14:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
You said, well, Chen Mei is the one that's most like looked in. Yeah. And like when he was talking about MBA, I think he wanted to take the MBA for the actual learning, not for the degree.

15:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I got the guy that at the end as well. But I was like, I, we just kind of went into a different topic. But I could hint that, oh, he thinks he needs to learn about business to do business.

15:18 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, one of the things I can maybe has nine doesn't show that kind of that all the things all the nice things that we see in China, because his English is not a good like, if you're, if you're Second language is not that good, you just speak less of it usually.

15:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, I think the reason why he's not good at English, like compared to me, which I also didn't study English like Nasif is doing, is because they speak Hindi, which you can find a tutorial, you can find YouTube videos, you can live on the internet in Hindi. You can't live on the internet in Norwegian. So I was forced to watch everything I watched, entertainment, tutorials, everything in English. They are all watching it. Like I had a discussion with them, both Biwas and Hasnain, they always watch in Hindi. Like if they need a tutorial for something, they always find the Hindi version. I advised Biwas not to, I advised him to watch in English instead to improve his English, but I don't know if he took it to heart.

16:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. You know, you know, I was reading back at my messages and see if, and we were talking once. I remember about like how his, um, the way he works is just kind of different from what we like, But I think that's not true. I think maybe it's just the way he expresses himself is, is how he was. Uh, Nazif Nazif.

16:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, Nazif. Okay.

16:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Like I was looking at our WhatsApp chats and, um, And we were talking about, okay, let's do this. And he was like, oh, excited to be part of this new adventure. It's like a dream coming true for me, and I'm very grateful. So I think for him, working, getting a full-time job for a company, or at least like an aspiring, an ambitious company is kind of part of what he likes. I think he's, I wanna ask him some more questions when he gets back. I don't wanna, of course, interview him, but I wanna figure out, like, What do you prefer more to be a freelancer or to have a team that understands you and you can work with both sides?

17:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
If we were talking about developing, the way we disagreed with his frame of mind was that he wanted to focus on getting just the best at one thing, but we think it's better to explore all the avenues because that makes you better at the one thing. Was there any change of perception from your end there, or is that still the same?

18:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or was it just on the like wanting to be a freelancer compared to wanting to have a full time?

18:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think I think I confused those two. I probably remembered wrong that the main point was that he wanted to focus on one thing. Whereas when you're in a team, it involves working on all other things, I guess.

18:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not even on the team, just like if you're a developer in general, you should learn everything.

18:31 - Jorge Lewis 
An employee, yeah.

18:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not like outside of a job, I'd just be learning new shit every two weeks. I'd be learning Rust, I'd be learning SIG, I'd be learning HTMX, I'd be learning, just jumping from thing to thing because when I jump back again, I'll be so much better than if I just focused on that thing.

18:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually good developers are the ones doing everything. They're not really...

18:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe we could help him open his eyes to that. At some point, we've had our idea or our dreams were like, oh, we're going to be experts at this one thing. Everyone has that. But since we've been forced to try everything else, we've kind of realized, oh, trying everything else helps us become better at that one thing if we wanted to.

19:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm kind of surprised he's like a fan of the Prime Engine. The Prime Engine is a big advocate of just trying stuff.

19:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
He made a Doom game on Twitch.

19:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he's making Doom and... What is it?

19:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
ASCII.

19:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. But like, he's learning OCaml now. I think he finished learning Rust. He's learning Go now. He's just advocating so much for just trying stuff. Someone even asked him, should I try Vim? And he said, it's not about Vim, it's about trying it. Try Emacs.

19:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
You just gotta get experience, try everything. Because if you spend one year on VS Code compared to six months VS Code, three months Emacs, three months Vim, you're and you eventually choose VS Code, you're going to be better on VS Code, because you know the fundamentals, you know how to compare servers, you know where it's a live server.

20:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I didn't actually... I sent a video regarding that Vim. I think it was a video from the Prime Agents saying you use Next for the wrong reasons.

20:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or you use Vim for the wrong reasons. Or don't use Vim for the wrong reasons, yeah.

20:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's you use Vim for the wrong reasons.

20:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I think the problem is different from the title. Maybe.

20:41 - Jorge Lewis 
But it was pretty funny because that day or the, yeah, I think it was that day, me and Will were talking about, or I was telling him, people listen to people like the Primagen and don't realize that they're spending more time configuring their Vim setup than writing solutions. And there's so many reasons why people like, the main thing is just, you have to think for yourself and figure out, okay, Should I be using Vim or should I be using VS Code? And I feel like for most people it's VS Code. For most people.

21:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like if you're in... I'd argue VS Code with Vim bindings though. Vim bindings are just amazing.

21:19 - Jorge Lewis 
No, not Vim bindings. The emulator. Or the... I still haven't gotten it, but... Fabian told me there's like an emulator where it's actually like Vim in VS Code, which gives you the best of both worlds.

21:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not just the Vim plugin?

21:39 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's like, it's, I don't know. I think it was something else. I can't remember.

21:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you guys still get like the call on the command line and everything.

21:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I've heard of it, but that sounds difficult.

21:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. The main, my main point was with, with Will was just like, yeah, it's, you can't, why use Linux if like you have to really just think what benefits do you get from it other than looking cool when someone else sees your screen? Cause. Damn, I felt cool when I was in the airport with my Linux, NixOS and my Vim. When I'd be in the co-working space and other people can see my Vim and I'm like, yeah, new Vim by the way.

22:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like for me, I think like the time I've spent with Wynn now, if I moved over to VS Code, I'd be much better at working with VS Code or whatever, Editor, Emacs, like at setting it up to how I like it, knowing what, how it should work to work most efficiently with it, all of that. I feel like it's almost more true the opposite, where I think Will, he literally just copied Primogen's config and used his Vim because Primogen said Vim is good. But Vim is all about being a personal development environment where you decide exactly how it's most efficient to you.

23:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Will seemed to have a good understanding that Linux is only for certain people. He showed that he had good understanding of that, but there's one point we disagreed on, which I can't remember exactly what.

23:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyways, before we go into the night, let's just kind of dive into the topic, and then we can see where it goes afterwards, just so we can finish that up at least. So yeah, as I said in the Discord message, So ideally, next time or on the third time, we can set up a podcast. So we both set up our cameras or our phone cameras, whatever you want to use, and treat it like a podcast. We can livestream that. And then we post-process it. We can add in some voiceovers, animations, and all that to make it into a concise video.

24:04 - Jorge Lewis 
But right now, so I've made a day in the life video. Um, it was just ad hoc. It was like, it was midday and I was like, all right, let's just record. And I just kind of recorded the whole day. Um, and I've learned so much and I'm just, that's why I've decided, let's not start with a podcast. Start with this. We'll pretend it's a podcast. Um, or at least, I mean, it's like most podcasts are uploaded, not live stream.

24:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
So that's the podcast. I'm not live podcast. Live podcasts are very new thing.

24:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. But then the, I guess the most, the most of the setup is regarding your, your, your equipment, like your cameras and stuff, but also being in the frame of mind to be able to speak properly. Like if you write that. So right now when I, what I learned is I'm terrible at speaking into a camera. I thought I was good. I thought I was like, Oh, I'm a good speaker. But you put yourself in front of a camera and know that people are going to be watching. You're like, uh, and in your head, you don't sound that bad, but you watch it back and you realize every two words is a filler word. And you're like, wow.

25:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

25:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Also. Yeah. I mean, I guess when you're in a podcast, you don't have to look at the camera, but I've realized like just regarding my YouTube channel. Um, I don't have like in this one video that I made the day in the life, I don't have time to edit that. It took me way too long to edit. I recorded it Monday, by the way. I'm going to publish it this Monday. It took me a week to get done with all my other stuff. That's just not the schedule I want. I don't like the stress that it has, but I really enjoy the filmmaking and the cinematic and that part. So what I think I might do is at the start right now, since all I want to do right now is just document, I'll make the similar style videos as I just sent you from Joe. What's his name?

26:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Joe, Joe. Wow. Oh, wow. How, how, wow? D-Woz is at your table, by the way. Oh, bruh. What's he saying? I just heard clicking half the time from my microphone went together and so D-Woz, he also waved at me.

26:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
What would you say?

26:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'd make videos like Joao, where it's just like you maybe write a script for like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and then you speak off of that. And it's just very minimal, mostly stories, so that when you're speaking, you don't have to do research. And it's just from your experience. It's not opinions. It's just experience. And, um, that way the quality to make, or the effort to make those videos is really low, but you can dish out, you can build a fan base. And later I would, as when I could be able to afford it, I'd hire an editor to edit my videos, but make my own cinematic or kind of, I guess, cinematic films. Cause I want to, I want to have like, like, for example, who I am is, is a video that I would spend probably a couple of months on just as like a passion, just like the, He's trying to join

27:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
from his personal account.

27:39 - Jorge Lewis 
But like right now, I just don't have the time to work on it. And I've been at least told probably five times this one week to focus on one thing.

27:53 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you need?

27:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Just checking in.

27:59 - Jorge Lewis 
We're doing a... It's good to see you. Well, good to hear you. No, I haven't seen you for like a month at this point.

28:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Since, I think, last Thursday.

28:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Way before that.

28:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Since Nexus OS got installed on this computer. I think it's Linux in general because like the research like we did or when troubleshooting it we googled the laptop model and it seems to just be struggling every distro.

28:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Some wine.

28:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Some wine?

28:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

28:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can I make a cocktail?

28:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Are Just some classic one. Enjoying it with my beautiful classical musician over there. You can hear that?

29:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I can't, but I've had a keyboard like that. I know the sound it makes.

29:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Is my mic fixed by the way?

29:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I went to the- No, we can't hear you.

29:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Bye, I got a motorbike now.

29:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Finally. The Honda Wave 125i.

29:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
You know what?

29:44 - Biwas bhandari 
You're renting or buying it?

29:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Renting, and then I'll probably buy it, but I'm also looking at Facebook's marketplace to see if I'll get a better deal.

29:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, yeah.

29:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Most of them are in Bangkok. The one selling it, it seems like, legit, I'm not joking, probably 20% or like 10% of them are the Honda Wave model, and no one's selling it. Everyone just wants to keep it. It's good.

30:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
The one I've got now has a whopping 480,000 miles on it, or kilometers. What, how much? 480,000?

30:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Bro, it drives like butter still. It's just like the 10,000 one I just tried before, which was double the price.

30:36 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you get 480,000 in 5 miles?

30:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like locals. That's the one that they drive to.

30:46 - Biwas bhandari 
It's like it's running since the sixties. Continuously seven years old.

30:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Oh, yes.

30:58 - Jorge Lewis 
As your, as your clients, I would expect more updates for my rest, my Read.AI tool.

31:04 - Biwas bhandari 
I create everything is done and I created the PR because what do you haven't, I think most did yet.

31:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is that how you speak to a client? You ask him to merge your PR requests?

31:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm still waiting for my manager to merge me.

31:23 - Biwas bhandari 
I pushed it, but my manager haven't merged it, I think. So it depends on him.

31:35 - Jorge Lewis 
I applied to the Thiel Fellowship, by the way.

31:38 - Biwas bhandari 
You applied?

31:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, I usually don't apply. There's a deal with Spencer link to the field fellowship, Peter Thiel, I believe. And I usually don't apply to those grants, because this usually requires like a lot of mentorship, like they want to bring you up and kind of say, Oh, we've raised this guy. But what it looks like on their website, it's just like, we literally just give you money and you like to enable you to go do whatever you want.

32:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Apply or like only you and then you got me and it's less, it's less Oh, your name and your email. Uh, you cut out there for the entire explanation. I just heard your name and their email.

32:23 - Jorge Lewis 
My hair.

32:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. You're back.

32:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Uh, yeah.

32:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Do you know about building space? And they also do the, uh, yeah, they also do the same kind of thing.

32:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. But most, most of the time is those, those things require you to kind of, they, they, they make you do a lot of programs and like mentorship things. And then I just, I'm not interested in that, but it seems like the field fellowship is kind of all about just being, just giving you money to enable you to build a business.

32:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

32:58 - Biwas bhandari 
When I was looking at this, um, I don't know. That techcrows do you know about those guys let me see their channel there one one of the audience said that if you are building a startup or something like that uh they gave you yes same like the fellowship program but it's canadian I think Um, if I find that video once again, I'll send it.

33:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

33:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, Jorge, could I get just from a, like 1% to like a hundred percent confidence level of getting a grant here and how much, just so I have any context because yeah.

33:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Um, there's an off of the top of your head number. Doesn't have to be accurate. Like seven.

34:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Because they're, what is it? How did you find it?

34:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Uh, yeah, I mean, my friend sent it to me.

34:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So they don't have any marketing. It's just word of mouth. And like the people that are getting, that are trying to apply or people like us and his friends. So I think my resume is.

34:28 - Jorge Lewis 
there's maybe it shows it depends of course what type to invest in whether it's people that have a year or two experience or whether it's people fresh but people over there fresh usually don't take money very well yeah well like how much and what was it seven percent you said it's a hundred thousand grants over two years when you realize Next year that wouldn't be so much to us.

35:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, yeah, but the current mouse, that would help.

35:12 - Jorge Lewis 
In case you didn't know, we're trying to reach 100k this year, by December. So far we're about 40, 41, I think so far. Um, but we have, we have, that's not considering, uh, uh, promise.

35:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, okay.

35:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Uh, besides Kuwan and JP, I haven't seen other clients. I mean, I was trying to reach other clients out after only completing these two.

35:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, so the biggest or that it was mostly just small clients like the below 1000 Oh, we had one above 1000. That was a Guy with money that doesn't have time. And he doesn't put any time into his website. He just gave us money and told us to make it. And then we made something, delivered it, and has he gotten back to us?

36:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Very interesting.

36:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wait, isn't this month that we're supposed to ask for a retainer?

36:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Next month.

36:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Have you been in contact with them at all?

36:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, here and there. Not recently, but I think the last time I checked was maybe January.

36:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
What's your confidence in getting that retainer?

36:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Pretty high. If you consider that they're the biggest garage company in Hong Kong. How much were they doing a year? I think it was 50 million.

37:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
I wonder if it'll be more like, ah, I'll support the small fry. Or if it'll be like actually valuing the website, because is he still running advertisements for the old one?

37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
That was so weird.

37:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
We made him a whole new modern website, much better than the old one looking. And the week after, we searched up his company and got an advertisement for his old website, not the one we made.

37:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I think my dad found it.

37:40 - Jorge Lewis 
My dad searched up Wonderly and the ad came up for their old website and my dad checked it out and was like, you made this?

37:50 - Biwas bhandari 
And I was like...

37:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me send it to you. Maybe it's still up. Oh no, it's down. It's because we took their domain. But it was like 1990s, like raw HTML.

38:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the old one down?

38:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I mean, there's, cause we took the, we took the wonderland.com domain.

38:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Oh, we better not like the, the, the domain name management of that one, by the way, is seven years has paid off it. We'll get no notification, but before it runs out, we have to transfer it.

38:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Dude, that's a 3d animation. Oh yeah.

38:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh yeah, go to wonderly.com if you want to see some of our work. You can see all the remnants of our past projects. If you look in projects, you can see itino, startino, wonderly, reditor, oneoffs, oneoffscaptures. Can you see the screen?

38:57 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, yeah.

38:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's probably lagging.

39:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I have to refresh to get the fresh animations.

39:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, I remember you made this like, and while you were making it, you were trying to make everything into work with, uh, Lord.

39:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
I hope that didn't traumatize you too much.

39:49 - Biwas bhandari 
I brought back some bad memories.

39:53 - Jorge Lewis 
That was like the most naive thing we could ever think. We were like, dude, let's give us LORC. It stands for Library of Reusable Components.

40:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't need to go any further. We thought we were being like the newest. We thought we were like so innovative.

40:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
We tried to save every component, everything we made into this like component library that we were planning to use internally in every project we had.

40:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
So we tried to write all our code reusable.

40:50 - Jorge Lewis 
At least now I know what it takes to build a reasonable library.

40:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Just an interesting note on that, over like five projects or so, we'd be able to use all of our code and input it to a code generation system.

41:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Like it would be really good at, so I mean, actually what I want to try is, been on my bucket list a while, Shed CN code generation thing.

41:23 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, that's what I said. No, uh, generative UI.

41:31 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, not generative UI. I mean, like, like code, like generative, like it creates the code that makes the UI.

41:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

41:40 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, that, that that's generative UI. That's like in a chat bot, it can create new UI on the spot. I'm talking about like an entire code base. So like backend plus frontend, like everything. Oh, you mean back into, I mean, like the Vercel does it in ShedCN. You know, that's using ShedCN. Yeah.

42:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Also, I think my one recommendation will be, for example, every time we do a project, we need a signup login compulsory. So we just, why don't we just create a template of that?

42:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we've had that on our to-do list for a little bit, a little while.

42:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let's see if I was supposed to create a template quite some time ago.

42:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Because every time we do project, we do not need to spend time on those things.

42:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

42:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Because we've done it already twice for Oak and for Itino. So it is something. So whatever Will is working on right now, those two weeks that he's going to spend on it should realistically be like half a week.

42:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, if you don't mind, it's already past bedtime already and I still have to finish this whole thing with Jonas.

43:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, what a hard thing.

43:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you read in the chat that I added you in, that's kind of why I added you there, so that you would read the text that was there and get some context.

43:15 - Jorge Lewis 
But the study joined.

43:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
I added you because if you read right above, it says, let's pretend it's a podcast so that we can learn. I'll be recording our session. Basically, we were going to be recording the podcast, YouTube video, Ugly Codaskin. Oh.

43:40 - Biwas bhandari 
Will you upload it? Huh? Yeah. Then I'll also go. It's already 11 here.

43:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
11pm. It's 12 here. Jorge, you never answered my question. How sober do I have to be for the podcast?

44:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Undetectable to a stranger.

44:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've had water in this but I can fill it up with something else.

44:18 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm gonna go have a good night guys.

44:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Have a good night. See you tomorrow.

44:23 - Biwas bhandari 
Just the mic is peaking but otherwise it's nice.

44:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have this one. Don't worry. It's out of the allowance. What is that?

44:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I wouldn't care.

44:51 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a valid purchase. What is it? Well, I can't even read that like it's yeah, it's like Samsung.

45:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like the it's rum. Basically, it's just rum. Cheaper whiskey.

45:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
So it's 40%.

45:10 - Jorge Lewis 
You just have that there or any special occasion or just like, I might as well?

45:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like, I mean, just straight up, I like the taste of Coke better with some mixed in. But also like some nights we hang out just in the living room here.

45:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I've found a passion for wine yesterday and I was like, I'm in the mood for some wine. I'm glad this wasn't that expensive. It's not! This was like $13.

45:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, it's $13 too, which...

45:53 - Jorge Lewis 
There goes your weekly allowance for food.

46:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I hate though. It's like you're in Thailand and just everything is great. But then you leave and you're like, you just enter depression. And I think there's a term for it like, like, yeah.

46:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like the motorbike I'm renting is like the nice version of it. It's the one, two, five, five. Okay. It's, it's got but they also had another one, which he said was like 10 years old. And I was like, why does it have kilometers? Oh, that's because it's gone to a million and flipped over.

46:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, it's like, I think for the month I paid $2,500.

46:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Why did you...?

46:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I have no clue what he's saying. Matias, what are you doing? It's 1am.

46:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm doing the dishes.

47:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Matias, what are you doing?

47:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think he may have...

47:18 - Jorge Lewis 
You're just filling cups up and then... Just go sleep. So your brain can develop.

47:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

47:37 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

47:41 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen. So I prepared videos that we can just kind of We can watch.

47:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let me just pour a little bit.

48:07 - Jorge Lewis 
This not being able to open a YouTube tab is really annoying.

48:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me know if you can hear whatever is being recorded, or whatever is being...

48:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I can't. How about doing it on Discord instead of Google Meet? You have OBS, right?

48:57 - Jorge Lewis 
On this, I do. But does it run?

49:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Thailand's great.

49:24 - Jorge Lewis 
You sounded like you just got there like a week ago.

49:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm saying it as a conclusion, like now I've lived here for quite a while, right? Four months.

49:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I was there for like, like 10 weeks.

49:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Start of April, then left for two weeks, April. Yeah. So.

49:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, hasn't... Oh yeah, you got out at the right time though, to be honest. Like, it's been quite... Every night it rains, so... You can imagine nightlife isn't that good at the moment. Though I'm not going out often.

50:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, here it rains pretty often as well.

50:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I see you have the WetUSDT tab.

50:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, my Chrome.

50:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

50:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is it at 0.025 now, or is that from ages ago?

50:42 - Jorge Lewis 
No clue.

50:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
How's it going? Oh. Oh. Oh, that's the time.

50:59 - Jorge Lewis 
It's hit. I checked my Binance accounts, I'm down a K.

51:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm down like 6 K total I think.

51:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Cheers to that.

51:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

51:15 - Jorge Lewis 
To the moon.

51:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing is though. Is still going strong, and if this is an ABC pattern, like up, down, up, you know, ABC, then it's, if BTC pops up, I think we're getting the C curve of the ABC, and it should be nice.

51:41 - Jorge Lewis 
We're relying on this Christmas season to like, this October, November to kind of pop off. If it doesn't, then RIP.

51:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are we, like, according to my friend, which has been saying this since forever, it's going to be like 2025, which is the year it pops up. He said, like, the bear season was coming a bit, like, before it came now. But he's always said 2025 is going to be the year.

52:15 - Jorge Lewis 
It may be. No.

52:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, you can watch them.

52:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Wasn'T… I'm on my laptop.

52:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I can move to my PC actually.

52:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow, finished already?

52:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Way more than half.

52:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean like the glass.

52:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't, I don't, I don't know why, but I don't like pouring a full glass.

52:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's a, I like to feel like you want to swirl it.

52:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like, no, just when you finish, because if it's a full glass, you finish and you're like, wow, I finished the full glass. But if it's a half glass, you're like, no, I only finished half.

53:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

53:17 - Jorge Lewis 
This is going to take a while trying to figure out how to put a cork bag. Good night, buddy. That'll do.

53:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I wonder what's going to happen if I go to the US, or if my parents go to the US.

53:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hmm. Yeah. Texas. How expensive is it there?

53:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, expensive.

53:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you at least like live with your parents and still do the high-ticket networking?

53:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, that's the only option. Like I can't live by myself there probably. I guess at some point, that's not a limitation.

54:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
What about like moving to Chiang Mai?

54:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it would depend. So let me just turn off all the lights. Um, so they're probably going to decide within like two weeks. Um, So if they do end up going, what I think I'm going to do is stay in Asia until Christmas, and then fly over there for Christmas. And then if we do end up bringing the whole team down to Chiang Mai, then I'll fly back down for that.

54:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think most probably I'd join in the house, by the way.

54:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nice.

55:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
How's sales going? How's what?

55:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Sales. Pretty bad. I've been trying to handle loads today.

55:21 - Jorge Lewis 
why it's been the responses haven't been they feel like they haven't been high so I was trying to figure out so one assumption I had was because I was doing comments before as out So even though it makes the account look bad, and potentially all that, it did, I think, get more responses. So I was evaluating that earlier. All right. I am going to connect to my laptop or to my PC. I'm going to use the Russian first.

58:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yo, yo, yo.

58:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yo, let me connect my iPod.

59:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

59:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. All right, nice.

59:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

59:14 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, let me go ahead and share my screen.

59:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, yeah. Can you see my screen?

59:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, yeah, I can.

59:41 - Jorge Lewis 
If you can hear anything.

59:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
No.

59:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bro.

59:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let me see if it's my side Yeah, there's no like the unmute button.

59:55 - Jorge Lewis 
That's great that I think you need to share the browser not the entire screen I'm sharing the browser But I need to share a tab to share the audio yeah, oh wait, I can just I know what to do

1:00:18 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the What's the command or what if you change the URL to?

1:00:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Question mark of user equals one.

1:00:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Don't work for me.

1:00:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
What's the number? Like if you go to Gmail and change to your personal account, what's the slash you slash number? Change to that number.

1:00:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Just opens in its own.

1:00:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Can I just add a tab without a...

1:00:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just try all the offuser equals something until you get one that's correct. You can't have that many.

1:01:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I just, I don't think it's going to work.

1:01:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

1:01:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you signed in with your personal account?

1:01:20 - Jorge Lewis 
No, not signed in with this one.

1:01:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but like, uh, go to like Gmail and then add account and add your personal account.

1:01:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Click on one, then it should be off user equals one.

1:01:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I can, I can join from the

1:01:55 - Jorge Lewis 
the browser with that signed into my personal one.

1:01:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
For, if you're using brave, which you should be, you should create two profiles.

1:02:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you're using brave, you should create two brave profiles, one for personal and one for work.

1:02:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So hopefully what doesn't end up happening is that we just end up watching these whole videos and we don't stop in the middle if, like, we don't stop them.

1:02:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's like the worst thing or what?

1:02:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, because the point isn't to watch the videos, it's to discuss the videos. Yeah. Hopefully our creativity does something. All right, I've got them here now.

1:03:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think just one person has to be in charge of when a point starts. So you just play the video and stop when you want to come in something. And then we just discuss that thing.

1:03:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then I can mention something if it's explicitly like something I want to talk about otherwise. Bad code is good.

1:03:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is pretty much the entire statement, I think. Although my title is ugly code is good. So I guess I think bad code is better, but yeah, let's get into it.

1:03:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Lately I've been thinking a lot about bad code and how, honestly, it gets a bad rap.

1:04:17 - Speaker 1 
I really believe that writing bad code is a critical skill in a great software developer's tool belt. As crazy as that sounds, I hope by the end of this video, you'll think so as well.

1:04:31 - Speaker 1 
In case you're new here, let me introduce myself. My name's Troy and I've been writing code now for over 15 years. Throughout that time, I've worked for tons of companies from small early stage startups to huge tech giants like Amazon. Most recently, I co-founded my own startup where I'm the CTO and make all of the engineering hiring decisions. And one of the biggest problems that I see is that engineers aren't writing enough bad code.

1:05:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think that was his the nicest way you could put it that they're moving too slow.

1:05:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So what is bad code? Generally speaking, you can put bad code in three separate buckets. There's code that's poorly abstracted or tailor-built for one specific use case, the code that is slow or inefficient, and then there's just code that doesn't actually work. To be clear, I'm not trying to say that you should write code that doesn't work, but these first two are valuable tools to have in your tool belt when it makes sense for what you're working on. It's important to remember that when we're writing code, we're writing code for a business, and there's a real why behind the code we're writing. For example, say your business wants a way to send real-time messages back and forth between your customers. So you architect this really nifty solution that lets customers send messages that then go into some queue that automatically get prioritized by a series of customizable functions and then show up in a support queue for the designated department to address. That solution sounds awesome. The only problem is that your company is a soft drink distributor, and even at massive scale, you're only expecting to get 10 to 20 requests a day. So honestly, it would probably be better for you to just build a pretty basic real-time chat app by copying someone's tutorial on Medium. I remember at a previous company having a heated debate with a senior engineer that we had hired from some tech giant. He was pushing back on my suggestion to use a code generation tool called Hasura in our architecture. His argument was that at his previous company, they had used a code generation tool in the past, and when they got to a big enough scale, they had to move off of it, and it cost the company millions of dollars. From his perspective, that makes sense. He joined the company years and years after they started using that code generation tool and only really got to experience the pain from moving off of it. He was missing something, though. The company's decision to use that code generation tool was very likely the reason that they got to the scale that they did. It let them build faster, prove out the product market fit and make changes really quickly. Sure, having to spend a bunch of time rebuilding it sucks. But there's a very real chance that they would have never made it to the scale where that was necessary had they not decided to use it. We ended up moving forward with my suggestion and using Hasura, and the tech stack that I designed there has supported the company well through being valued over a billion dollars. The point I'm getting at here is that when we're developing, we have a ton of tools at our disposal. What's really important is that we pick the right one for our specific business needs. Knowing what tool you should reach for is what can make the difference between a good engineer and an absolute wizard. There's a tightrope that you have to walk between delivering business value and providing high-quality, scalable systems, and admittedly, it's a hard line to walk. I've worked with tons of brilliant people who get it wrong. To close, not every piece of code we write needs to be brilliant. I've written thousands upon thousands of lines of code that weren't well abstracted or super efficient. And most of that code is still being used years and years later. So please, go build an incredibly robust, efficient system when it's warranted. But don't be afraid to write some hacky, bad code when that's what the business needs. By the way, the majority of people watching aren't subscribed, so if you- Yeah, so what'd you think?

1:08:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he nailed one of the three main points down as abstraction, which I think is where we may be disagreeing, because I do not think abstraction is, like, not abstracting is an issue at all. I think not abstracting is very good code, because then you can jump in at any point, and you can just run through the file, see what it does, compared to if it's very abstracted, you have to get to know the code base very well to be able to work fast in it. But other than that, yeah.

1:09:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:09:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, he hit pretty much every point. Um, and you know, like we probably, we agree with most of what he said because his background is very similar. Well, other than the part where he worked at big companies, but he started his own startup and in startups, this, this whole bit is super important where if you're just moving too slow, the code that is good code, then you're not going to make it.

1:09:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's also interesting that with Amazon being the big company is worked at, that means like for Amazon It's a tech giant, but their logistics lie in not specifically tech, if that makes sense, compared to Netflix, Google, like all of those live completely online. Amazon lives in real life and on text. I heard it quite like...

1:10:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Amazon has more logistics, but...

1:10:35 - Jorge Lewis 
You're like, this is a good example or at least just every example where it's just like, yeah, you, there's no, you have to understand the needs to, to figure out what, and the need is, is a, is part of understanding the vision and mission of, of the whole product or the whole project. If you don't understand that you're building for a hundred users and you're, you're trying to build a platform that scales for 10,000, like there's just something totally off. And I've got into this so many times with the team recently. Like, for example, for the milestones, the simplest way to do it is for every time the user inputs new tracking data, we're going to pull the list of milestones, all the milestones, we're going to pull the history of of the checking data, and we're going to do a couple things. Every time we get new tracking data, we're going to calculate the sum of that new tracking data. We're going to compare it to all of the milestones. Does it compare to all of them? In terms of efficiency, that is the Least efficient way like there's no I mean you could on purpose make it more less efficient But like just the default that's the default like you just pull everything you get everything and you can just compare it one by one That's the slowest way you could do it, but that is good enough like on the server side comparing what is it like 500 rows per user maybe two times three times a day isn't like you just have to compare put in richest in how relative it is to the project of the project like I don't know it's like how good do we have to make this code not good at all like I mean the what has nine actually started with was using an AI agent to compare the milestones that was kind of the code looked quite nice because it was all a prompt but the the simplest way is to just use if else statements if this is if the sum is greater than this or if the streak is greater than this so it's like the best code like the best way you could architect it would probably be I don't know storing some sort of values in a cache throughout the day or Like, there's different architectures you can apply to make this more efficient. Like, undoubtedly, but

1:13:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
To add on to that with, like, I remember before when we were building up the graphs and everything, getting the engineers on, we're storing all the events and all the messages just in the database. They want to optimize it. To instead store it in a cache and then upload to the database, not every single call, not having to get from the database every single time you open the application. But that's trying to optimize performance and trying to optimize database usage for all our total of zero users currently, which like, It's not where we should be. It's not what we need to be working on. Also, one of them suggested we should be backing up our servers. We have no valuable data on our servers. It's just kind of like the video by Code Statics, the triangle of velocity, Optimization and I have those videos queued up by the way.

1:14:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I have premature optimization queued up.

1:14:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1:14:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
But basically just know what to work out with on at which point, what is important to get down at which point and yeah. Yeah.

1:14:31 - Jorge Lewis 
It's interesting. I think our points so far have been not bad code, but more so Like so far, all we've mentioned is design or I guess planning or.

1:14:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I think it comes down to when you're working on an application, you need to think about like, what is the number one thing that needs to be done right now? Not what is something that could be nicer hair? Like what is the number one thing that's required from this feature? What's the number one thing?

1:15:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So one thing though, for Arrest for example, I've taken a look at that codebase and the whole superbase thing. It is terrible. It needs to be reworked. I'm trying to go into that codebase and change some things but it's just so tough because everything is so badly made. It was made in two days.

1:15:43 - Jorge Lewis 
There's, I guess, I don't know, it's like, there's also that side where it's just like, at some point, if you make code that's, or you design your, your, your code base, that's like made to last a week. I don't, I have to, and that's the code, that's the whole term code that, or tech debt, where it's like after a month, you have to refactor or not refactor, but you have to re kind of redesign, I guess.

1:16:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, rest is a smaller project, like in everything, so I don't know how accurately it applies, but... Your need to optimize it comes from it being, it working and it being out there so fast. Like you got it working and up there and got us clients through the application within two days. If you spent two weeks making it perfect, I don't think it would be as efficient at doing the thing it was like number one thing it was supposed to do, if that makes sense.

1:16:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Exactly. Like, and recreating it from scratch is not as much work. Like, so we're looking at two scenarios. The first scenario is you make it perfect the first time. The second scenario is you make it fast in two days and then you make it again for a week. I think the duration making it perfect the first time is longer than where you make it two times. It's the same with the, it's the idea with the pottery, the, the research or the study behind the pottery thing. Where it's like, if you make a lot of them, you'll get good at making pottery. If you make one perfect pottery, you're not going to get that good.

1:17:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:17:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Also taking the example in the video, the support ticket system. You can make the simple one, just customer sends a chat to support. Once that's in place, which takes super fast, it's much easier to recreate it and create the more advanced one when needed. It, then it would be to like create the more advanced one immediately because then you understand the needs, then you understand all the requirements, then you also haven't invested much time into it. And the time you have invested into it is a very simple piece of achieving this one mission.

1:18:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. One question I have is like, did Netflix design was their first, like when they, when they had their first, let's say 10 was that version of the code base scalable? Was that, could that handle hundred 10,000, thousand users?

1:18:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, no way. That's what the primogen has been working on. He made Falcor, which I don't know if you've heard him talk about Falcor, but I think it's the media codec relay thing that they used to send they send so much data out to users now, but like everything has to be scaled using microservices. It's definitely something that's been modified time and time again, and it's probably still constantly being optimized.

1:19:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Cause it's just like, like for example, the milestone thing, if we made the most efficient thing for what, like we're saving $10 over a year.

1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis 
for like super base calls, or we're saving, you know, like 50 milliseconds every day. I don't know. It's just, you really have to, it comes down to understanding what you need, not what you want, not what's sexy. It's like, what would be sexy is if we had the fastest thing. What was what Maiden?

1:19:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Facebook.

1:19:36 - Jorge Lewis 
PHP.

1:19:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I think they went through a process of going from PHP to, they made like their own compiler, their own like subscript of a PHP or something.

1:19:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Now, I mean, now I have no clue, but

1:19:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think they're using OCaml now pretty heavily at Facebook. And that's like a nitty-gritty functional programming language. And I think they went into the nitty-gritty functional fancy-schmancy perfect language way after the platform took off.

1:20:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but it's like those are...

1:20:23 - Jorge Lewis 
those are some really big scale projects where it's, it's very easy to take examples out of like, Oh, what was Facebook built off PHP? Okay, cool. So let's use what we know. I think everyone kind of understands, Oh, let's use what we know. Like, or I feel like that's easy to say, like we right now I'm good at Python, so I'm going to use Python and, and whatever front end I can use. But I feel like the bigger thing we should be going into is, is the more does Hmm.

1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause picking what you know is important, but like there's, there's also like a balance, like for example, so, so let's, um, let's go, there's two, there's a couple more videos. So let's go through one, one more and then see, and then just go from there.

1:21:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:21:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay. This one I quite liked. Let me share.

1:21:32 - Speaker 4 
In Canada, I was doing a project for a big communication company. This guy, we used to ride share and he'd come round and beep the horn and pick me up and it was like minus 30 outside. So I'd slide my way towards the car and every morning he was talking about functions. What do you think about that?

1:21:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, I think it depends on what stage you're in your business, what stage you are in. Like with Facebook, the OCaml is the beautiful functional programming language that he's mentioning. And that's because they need that artistic perfection at the moment with like the, but you don't need that one starting.

1:22:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But do there, They switched to OCaml not because it was beautiful, but because it was functional, like because it served its purpose.

1:22:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Of course. Yeah. I mean, that's the beauty in it, how perfectly it serves its purpose. That's at least one. Yeah.

1:23:00 - Jorge Lewis 
If I'm not mistaken, it's about to get into what I'm about to say, which is the like i've never thought about my code in terms of the code but just what it does like at the end like if I can do this like that's the beautiful part like the output these books like clean code and pragmatic programmer these these are very controversial there's actually a video I think I'm gonna look for it right now but while we're watching

1:23:25 - Jorge Lewis 
this there's The I'm gonna teach you how to create code that is clean or beautiful Which really means that it's easy to read. It's easy to maintain So there is some functional advantage to doing that but I just think a lot of people just get lost in the code and lose touch of what the point of the code is and exactly what

1:23:49 - Jorge Lewis 
we need to enforce within our company.

1:23:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think much more valuable books are like programming patterns, for example, learning how dependency injection works, learning what inheritance is, should you use it, when should you not use it, like learning all the patterns, not the ways to make it more readable.

1:24:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I've never actually read those books, but there was one video I mean, I'm looking for it, but I'll find overtime. I mean, it's just like, if you get lost in the code, it's very nice to see that you love what you do. But if you're spend, like, spend your, your, you know, your over out your extra time or doing that not not the time I pay you.

1:24:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Did bro get hacked? Yeah, he did. Me? Who? No, Asim.

1:25:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh.

1:25:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:25:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
RIP.

1:25:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
RIP.

1:25:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
He posted on our server too. Yeah, I see that.

1:25:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, you're ready.

1:25:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:25:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just kick him from the server. You can add him back when he's… Feels so bad. Rift my guy.

1:25:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Like you said, getting lost in the code, I'm not forgetting I get lost in the code. Sometimes I'm like, oh, this needs to be perfect. But I have time to lose. The extra four hours between 8 and 12 that I spend on it is to no one else's demise, but to mine. It's just because I want to finish that today, and no one else is paying for it. It's not like you're getting employed to do it.

1:26:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like I'm perfecting this because I find, I find a lot of joy in myself perfecting stuff, like going into stuff that isn't immediately useful because that's what's made me the programmer I am today. Like it's, I just like, it's more so the learning experience from perspective than perfecting it and figuring out how it works entirely. Not just to figure out that thing, but just to increase my knowledge overall, that that's the value.

1:26:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:26:54 - Speaker 4 
One way you can figure out if you're lost in the code yourself is to ask the question of, if I can automate all the coding and make it so that, I don't know, you just dictate through some sort of AI chatbot the requirements very specifically, but in natural English, and it just generated all the code for you, would you see that as a good thing or a bad thing. And I think from my perspective, surely it's a good thing. It's like how today, rather than spending days creating some kind of intricate photorealistic image, you can just type your prompt into Adobe Firefly or Mid Journey and it will create you an amazing looking image in 10 seconds. Surely that's a good thing, because If I can create software that fulfills some requirement in 10 seconds rather than 10 hours, then that's 10 hours of my time that I get back to potentially do more productive tasks. Because ultimately, code is just a tool to achieve some sort of outcome, to do some calculation or present something to the user in a certain way.

1:27:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you think that's how people like Hasnain, BOS, and Shinmay think of it? Do you think they think it's a tool to reach the outcome?

1:28:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm not quite sure, but for me, usually the coding part is never the issue, especially in the tech stack we're working in. The coding has only ever been an issue when I'm learning something new, and that's how that works. It's all just a bit business and state management, or like the business logic and state management, coding that in properly, which if I was prompting an LLM, I'd also have to explain it properly. Code is just a language to express the business logic and the state management.

1:28:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not the thing I'm trying to make beautiful. I'm just expressing myself in it, if that makes sense. Making that code beautiful or in the best optimized way possible has never been the issue. If I go into like some way like how to do this in JavaScript, that's to learn for myself so that I know in the future and can do it faster. It's not for any specific task ever. It's not to make any specific piece of code beautiful.

1:29:25 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what companies care about. And that's definitely what users care about. They don't care how beautiful your code is or whether you're using a functional or imperative programming language. I mean, the way that this guy in Canada was talking about our functional code was like, he'd just been on a first date or something. And now that I've...

1:29:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Did he start focusing around?

1:29:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
He'd just been on a first date or something.

1:29:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, is it?

1:29:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it is.

1:29:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it 1S?

1:29:58 - Jorge Lewis 
And now that I've started building my own projects, like I built this thumbnail tool for YouTubers, and I'm having to realize that users don't care about my code, and there's a very good likelihood that the tool that I create, it's not going to be that useful that people are actually going to start using it depending on how good I market the tool, but if there's such a good likelihood that nobody's going to use it, then it's better to get the tool out there as quickly as possible without obsessing over the code quality, the test coverage, because until you get your software in front of the We've never we haven't done a single unit test in our at all

1:30:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
like Because it's you'd spend all this time making the video and The the thing that matters most if someone clicks on it and starts watching it is the thumbnail, which is the thing I'd probably want to spend the most time optimizing, if that makes sense. Like, I don't want to spend 18 hours making a video just to have an LLM generated shitty thumbnail that no one will click on, or few people will click on. That's like the eye catcher that needs to be optimized, right?

1:31:13 - Jorge Lewis 
this is you know that guy we met in um in the in the um the hoop what is it the shisha place um adam he he does like the you don't randomly like the automated youtube videos I'm guessing that's

1:31:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
what it's for oh yeah yeah lies the users don't care about my code code, and there's a very good likelihood that the tool that I create, it's not going to be that useful that people are actually going to start using it, depending on how good I market the tool. But if there's such a good likelihood that nobody's going to use it, then it's better to get the tool out there as quickly as possible.

1:31:57 - Jorge Lewis 
This guy needs to work on his... I've noticed this because I do this a lot. He adds a lot of cuts in the middle of his speaking, which is what you'd need to do when you don't plan what you're going to say, or you use a lot of filler words.

1:32:13 - Speaker 4 
Well, without obsessing over the code quality, the test coverage, because until you get your software in front of the eyes of users, you don't know whether it's actually solving a problem that they have. You don't know whether that software is going to go anywhere by obsessing over code.

1:32:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I didn't realize it until I said, without even saying something between. Maybe it's automated.

1:32:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's very, oh yeah.

1:32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause there's been like, I didn't realize it was that many.

1:32:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it cuts forward to him saying, ah, and then kind of get into him speaking.

1:32:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Maybe.

1:32:53 - Jorge Lewis 
You're procrastinating by doing something that's easy for you, which is polishing code endlessly, writing more and more tests until you feel completely satisfied rather than doing the hard thing, which is actually push that code to production, try to find

1:33:08 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm so glad our developers aren't experienced enough to even know what a unit test is. Like I'm so glad that I have not seen them make a single unit test. I don't know. Like there's the, there's the

1:33:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Unit tests are only useful if you have a very specific algorithm or something that you need to code for your specific business, and you need to test that that's working correctly. All our code is just something to do with the front end or directly interacting with database or AI, which is completely unpredictable. We never have code, which is running some calculation on like some person's account. Like that's something you test, like calculate this guy.

1:33:53 - Jorge Lewis 
We're only dealing with strings. Yeah. And the strings, there's no, there's no like extreme values.

1:33:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
There's just like, And extremely long string is extremely useful for applications where you have logic that's consistent. We don't have any logic that's consistent except for database interactions, which would be integration tests, not unit tests and just front end stuff, which doesn't need to be tested ever.

1:34:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So integration test is something that we should take a look at sometime soon.

1:34:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
integration tests are mostly useless and give you a false sense of security because what integration tests really do is make you put into code your perception of how the world works, not how it actually works. And then you're testing it against your perception of how a database works, not how an actual database works, if that makes sense. So you're always testing it against what you expect, not what you don't expect, which is what unit tests are better for.

1:35:09 - Jorge Lewis 
There's always a range of things that you could test for, and I guess when you test for those, that should be sufficient. If there was a way to test everything to 100% accuracy, this wouldn't even be a discussion. So I guess it's just a matter of, I hate this, but everything's a balance.

1:35:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I feel like most of our stuff is just a super basic wake call, like, get this table. Our stuff doesn't need any.

1:35:48 - Jorge Lewis 
It returns two things, data and error. If it has an error, you treat that error but if it doesn't then it's good.

1:35:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
A place to use an integration test is like if you have like an edge function and you want to make sure the edge function is returning the correct thing from your input. Yeah. Not if you just want to upload the thing to the db and for thread.

1:36:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah our programming is so simple really like it's just it's it's just very basic programming but we need to do it very like which makes it that if we do a bad job, it's pretty obvious. Like if we use three, four loops in a loop, that's like our really, really, that's our only code. Like we don't have much code really like,

1:36:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, three.

1:36:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

1:36:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, three. Oh, three. No.

1:36:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, I've never, I didn't study computer science, why would I? I did a competitive program, I should know.

1:36:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I wouldn't. My programs were always log n.

1:37:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow.

1:37:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

1:37:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Log n?

1:37:09 - Jorge Lewis 
No, but like, our code base is so simple. It's like, if you really take a look at it, there's there's not much code, like there's no, like there's no, nothing needs to scale, nothing like, I don't know.

1:37:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:37:37 - Speaker 4 
That software and face the reality of whether what you've created is part of Steaming Turd or actually it's the seed of an idea that could go somewhere. I have been the person that's been polishing code for a lot of my career. I kind of became obsessive.

1:37:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Now that I mentioned it, he just has so many cuts. Like I can't stop seeing them now.

1:38:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Test coverage, clean code principles, naming and all these things are really important if you're working on a code base which is going to be used by like hundreds or thousands of developers. But there was this one time I was leading a particular project and all the times that my boss was telling me that we really need to speed this along and I was polishing the code endlessly like the software was somehow An extension of me and if I didn't make it good, then I wouldn't be good. But now I see that boss's perspective and kind of wish that I'd said to him, Hey, we're going to push something out the door and it's, it's not going to be great, but we'll see whether this feature is actually something that's going to be useful to the customers or not. And in some way, beginners have a big advantage here because they don't even know that clean code is a thing, but they don't know the methods that are hundreds.

1:38:54 - Jorge Lewis 
That's actually a good point. He was shipped his code like super fast because he used tried catch everywhere. But that's a point I want to touch on later. I actually have a talking point. I have two talking points. One of them is how the experience and skill of a programmer affects the whole statement of ugly code.

1:39:16 - Speaker 4 
Lines long are necessarily less readable. Beginners are just focused on getting their web page or application to work.

1:39:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess that's one of the benefits. That sounded very nice actually. A junior developer, all they're trying to do is to get it to work. And that's all you're trying to do in a business world. You need it to work. You need it to accomplish what it needs to do. That's it.

1:39:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I feel like you're right, but the problem is juniors don't know what is needed. They usually have the wrong perception of what is needed to make it work and end up working on things that are not relevant.

1:40:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. For them, what's needed is just whatever's in their head and it works great if it's their portfolio website, but yeah.

1:40:19 - Speaker 4 
that are hundreds of lines long aren't necessarily less readable. Beginners are just focused on getting their web page or application to work. Once you've been in the software development industry, especially if you've been working for larger companies, you get this mentality that...

1:40:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Why was there an electric scooter?

1:40:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Industry, especially if you've been working for a large...

1:40:42 - Jorge Lewis 
What?

1:40:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh no, it's not electric. That's not electric. That's just...

1:40:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's kind of a given that you're gonna make the solution. What's the next challenge? You can do it's make this solution work plus make it as polished as you possibly can and Hopefully later down the line when people talk about that project, they'll be like that code man.

1:41:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
That was something else I As you know I think in my previous company I was like working for large part converting a legacy code old 20 into from Visual Basic to new C sharp laser amazing everything you know yeah that code base was something else yeah There were comments in both English and Norwegian, and most of them weren't explaining why anything was done. It was just like, this line does this. Thank you. Yeah, I could read that, but why?

1:41:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Comments is a whole topic of itself.

1:41:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:42:01 - Jorge Lewis 
He brings a good point that I think about it. No one gets praised for good code. When have you gotten praised for good code?

1:42:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing is, I think if I code good code, if I learn how to code good code, just to play devil's advocate, what happens is the next time I'm coding something similar or like what I learned from that, I can apply to a lot of scenarios and therefore move faster. I can move faster than B was has name, whatever, is because I have just like gone into the deep dive on so many topics that I know where I should prioritize my time where I shouldn't. And I already know, like conceptually, how I should be structuring things and where I should be putting my focus, where And I know the implementation techniques fully. So all I'm thinking about is the business logic and like, yeah, just states. I'm not thinking about implementation details at all.

1:43:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And that's exactly where my statement of how the experience of a programmer affects the whole statement. Cause if you're building code, that's just like just terrible. It could either be because you're trying to do it fast or it's because you don't know better. And if it's because you don't know better, then you have to be like, okay, if I don't know better, is the better solution, so for example, the try-catch.

1:43:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Why do senior engineers tell juniors not to use a try-catch statement? If at the end of the day, it makes the code ship faster.

1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Because in the long term they'll become a better fast-removing developer if they don't try catch Yeah, I when when he Like when I removed his try catches, it's not like I removed them and that's it. I had to I had to catch the error somewhere but there's a proper way to catch the errors that not only allows you to move faster in the future, but that's also more, like it's just more efficient in the longterm. It's easier to read for developers. There's like, I don't want to go into the specifics of like, Oh, when you use proper error catching and typing, you can, you know, blah, blah, blah. Like that, that part's obvious, but I feel like I'm trying to apply a general statement where it's like, if you learn, and it's exactly what he said, if you learn the best practices and kind of, how to make better code, you apply that in the future to be faster. It's similar with, if you learn how to properly catch an error from Superbase, you'll have to learn it once and you can apply it every single time.

1:44:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think where the problem comes in is when you're trying to put glazing on a cape, which you're only making once. If you're improving codes on a code base, that's totally irrelevant to every other project. It's like a piece of code you're only ever going to code on this project. And the thing you're optimizing and making pretty is something that's something How should I put it? That won't translate moving forwards. That's when it's a problem. That's when it's not worth it. But if it's a problem like you don't know how to handle errors in TypeScript, then you should learn how to handle errors in TypeScript because it's just a thing you know, and when you know it, you know it. But if it's like, you have this function and this function could be translated into a class, which could be used as a factory hair and hair and hair. That's not useful because that's just translating it into something you think is prettier. You already know how to implement both patterns and everything, but it's not useful. It doesn't speed you up. It doesn't teach you anything for the long term.

1:46:01 - Jorge Lewis 
It's only like, I wonder how different our perspective on programming is. Compared to people that went to computer science that took degrees because from what I know is they learn a lot of theory and they learn some practical stuff like they might learn some C++ to learn an algorithm. They do algorithms in their own code, maybe just JavaScript. They learn things like classes and inheritance all through theory. I learned that stuff in my code. So it's just, I'm, I feel like we're so out of sync with these guys, like with the general population of programmers where they learn things the formal way. So maybe it's just tough to see, see it from their eyes and

1:46:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, like, because they've learned it from theory, they could go, hey, this file, the functions in this file should be part of a class, they shouldn't be functions. Meanwhile, like, an actual problem that they should be focusing on takes is, I don't know how to handle errors. Let's learn how to handle errors. That's just like a straight up objectively better thing like that's going to help you long term and that you're always going to apply compared to an opinion piece on what's theoretically better.

1:47:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like, for example, for me, I've I, I don't remember learning classes. The only way the only reason I know classes is because I know of the concept of what a class is, which is it's just groups, properties, and functions together. And it's just a more compact way. I don't know. I'm just getting back to my point of I'm trying to view the code how they see it, which is so rigid. It has to be this way.

1:48:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not even it has to be this way, just I think it would be a better practice to do it this way, even though the other way already works and is in place and everyone understands it. I think it would be better practice if we put this AI file, made it a class, added the properties here that we actually just store in states for now, like just converting a thing that works into another thing that works, that they deem as prettier.

1:48:50 - Jorge Lewis 
It also goes down, like going down that rabbit hole, it's just like, The prettiest thing is what everybody understands the most.

1:49:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Like if everybody understands, like if your company or if you're like, usually for us, at least for small agencies, there's a style that people use or that the company uses. And for us, we have our style. We can't, we maybe can't define it in words, but we do definitely have it. And if we just keep that style consistent, that's the most efficient way to go.

1:49:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that's the whole argument for why formatters and keeping code style is important because formatters allow coders to code in any style they prefer. But when it's formatted, the look will be consistent. As you scroll through files, your eyes will be better trained to catch and interpret what's on your screen.

1:49:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I mentioned this earlier, but I couldn't pin it down. But what we should be focusing on here is not, I think, the code aspect because, or at least for us, have you had a developer trying to make their code perfect when programming? For me, I've only noticed that when design, like architecting a solution, designing a solution.

1:50:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
For me, I've only noticed that when I already have the solution and I'm like, but these two functions could be one function and the parameter that I'm passing in here could be a property.

1:50:36 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, exactly. Like that's what I do as well. Like for the rest thing, everything was like its own thing. And at the end of it, I was like, Oh, let's just make this a class. It was just, it was done within five minutes.

1:50:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so I do clean up my code. I don't like, it's just.

1:50:56 - Jorge Lewis 
It's so, the whole topic is so...

1:51:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the problem is when you're trying to make the clean code first, like you afterwards saw, oh, this can be a class and then made it a class. If you're before that trying to plan, okay, this should be a class because I have properties. That's when the problem comes in because then you're taking a long time thinking about how it should be structured and so just implementing it and then formulating it afterwards.

1:51:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And I could see university students going down that road because they learned, Oh, we need classes to make code. We need to make our code, our code using classes. So first let's start with what classes we need. But rather if you start from a functional first standpoint, it's like, what do we need? Okay. We're going to need this ID. We're going to need this, this, uh, post title, et cetera.

1:51:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Should you even switch from classes or from functions to classes?

1:51:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think in any of our, like even Adapt, I don't think we have a single class. And classes are like kind of this dumb. I think structs are the ones that are being loved more so now, just like having proper objects. But all of that just comes down to opinion pieces, as I mentioned, like how you structure it shouldn't be the important thing.

1:52:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's just I feel like it's just every time you speak, it's getting into this one point of how experience does matter. Because if we told our junior developers to ship code as fast as possible, every single time, they would never learn how to handle errors. Yeah, it's like So it's that and that's what my life my whole programming journey has been it's been to ship as fast as possible because From making video games. I don't care about how good or how pretty my code is like never like So, but at what point did I learn?

1:53:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I should be air checking and I I I think you kind of, I mean, like, just after having experience and having the goals set by yourself, while when you're creating five prior catches, you kind of realize, hmm, this can just error and I don't know what will happen. What will save me time in the long term and will be a thing that I just have to learn once that is how to handle layers properly so I don't suffer down the road and so I don't like or so that I just work more efficiently in general. So then we just look up the documentation. It's like the same with ShedCN. If like when we started with ShedCN, we wanted to make a landing page, The fastest way we could do it is just do it tailwind, draw tailwind, just YOLO. But we know that like, hey, ShadCN is going to be the thing we're going to be using. It's going to be helping us. It's going to be keeping things properly consistent with UI and everything. The benefits are worth it. And it's a thing to just learn once, then we apply it. That's when clean code does matter, if that makes sense. But that's not clean, that's making it readable. No, that's not making it readable, that's actually practical. Same with the error handling, that's not making it readable, that's the practical difference.

1:54:33 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a practical difference, but in the code it's...

1:54:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So who... So this statement, I came up with a statement because I, I guess I assumed it's the common notion. So I was, of course, when you, when you think of titles, you think you're trying to think of something, uh, like with, with, uh, conflict, I guess. So, which means that the Going with the grain would mean that making your code look pretty is, is the best way to go. But I don't think that's, that's how it is in the world. I think it's.

1:55:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the term people use is clean because it's not about making it pretty, it's about keeping it readable and clean.

1:55:23 - Jorge Lewis 
But that's not like a big issue in this.

1:55:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Making it readable is not an issue because we have formatters and we have Like for me, the issue is people over engineering solutions or or designing solutions that just aren't what we need over engineering. So.

1:56:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
be like, that code man, that was something else. But what really matters was the outcome of the project and the users that you served. And hey, if you can serve those users just as well with a monolithic application rather than a microservices architecture, then why the hell not? So the This is just a reminder to remember why you're writing code. Is it because you really love code or is it because you want to create something that code allows you to? Maybe once you figure that out, you'll do like I'm trying to do and not spend so long obsessing over the tiny details that aren't actually important.

1:56:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
The last part is actually pretty interesting because I feel like my adventure with coding was I want to create games, so I'm going to learn how to code to make this thing for my game. Then I really liked the coding, so I coded more things for the game. And then, like, as I got into coding and started loving coding more than creating the thing, I got into, like, other parts of coding which are more technical, less visual, like CLI tools, whatever.

1:57:08 - Jorge Lewis 
But did you fall in love with the coding or with the things that coding brings, which is doing, like, you can make things happen with code?

1:57:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's still making things happen, but it's got less visual.

1:57:27 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, I don't think, and maybe, maybe there's people, maybe like our team, and this is like, we need to figure this out. It's like, do they validate, like, are they looking at the code from a perspective of like, oh, look how, look how good this code is. I go from this to this instead of just like, oh, I have the output.

1:57:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know if I explained that very well.

1:57:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I remember when we were going over the fact that our client is the one that owns the code we write, that was quite the reaction out of one of our developers. Because he values the code, not the product. The code he wrote, that's his hard work. The product that comes out of it, that's their product. But the code he wrote, that's his code. That's his baby.

1:58:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and for me, it's easy to say. For me, my hard work is the things I've learned through that project. From all the projects I've made, what I take most of it is the learning, because I can scratch whatever I've made, make it again, better, faster. And in the back of my head, maybe there'll always be that, oh, I wasted all that time making that previous version. But it's like, did you really? I don't know.

1:58:54 - Jorge Lewis 
But at least this new version, it's fast, it's better.

1:58:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:59:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
All right.

1:59:04 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think, was this just a, I don't know, we were going to watch this one.

1:59:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Here.

1:59:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Grandpa. It's time for grandpa.

1:59:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Grandpa?

1:59:17 - Jorge Lewis 
With the most clickbait title.

1:59:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, yo, it's this guy, continues to deliver.

1:59:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
We all say that code is bad, this code is terrible.

1:59:30 - Speaker 2 
But what does it mean? And what should we do about it? That's our topic for today.

1:59:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hi, I'm Dave Farley, Continuous Delivery, and welcome to CICD.

1:59:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Mr. Who?

1:59:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Mr. TDD. He is a huge advocate of learning test-driven development and using it consistently throughout your coding as the foundation of how you think. I see. So I'm quite excited to see his opinion. If you haven't been here before, please do hit subscribe.

2:00:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I hope you enjoy the content.

2:00:16 - Speaker 2 
Today hit like as well. Bad code is probably a bad name for bad code, but at least colloquially, if not technically, we all know what we mean when we say it. That is not how I would have done it. Or if it's our code, that's bad. It's not how I do it now with the benefit of hindsight, bad code is code.

2:00:36 - Jorge Lewis 
This is just totally irrelevant, but one thing that I, I don't know if it's a language barrier. But some naming conventions, or not conventions, the naming of things I've seen are just so bad.

2:00:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Like they represent nothing of what they should be.

2:01:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So just keep that in your mind.

2:01:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Is not how I would have done it. Or, if it's our code that's bad, it's not how I'd do it now, with the benefit of hindsight. Bad code is code that is difficult, or at least unpleasant, to work on. In this episode, I want to explore what bad code really is, what's a sensible practical definition for good code, and what it takes to build good code and avoid traps in bad code based on some real-world examples. Fundamentally, bad code is defined, I think, by two things. Either it doesn't do what it should, or even if it does do what it should, it's too hard to change it when we need to change it. I'd argue that that's it. Everything else is changed.

2:01:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So if we use these two constraints, then the code I wrote for REST would be bad code because it's hard to change.

2:01:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I disagree. If you wrote it in two days, you can change it completely in two days.

2:02:06 - Jorge Lewis 
By remaking it, you mean? Yeah. Yeah.

2:02:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
And I think coding in a way that's easy to change would be more harmful because it would be structured in a worse way than the recreation would be. And it would take probably more than four days to create it in a very easy to change way.

2:02:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So for us, these small components where it takes days or even a week or even a couple weeks, then remaking things make more sense. But for, something that where you quote, it's going to take a couple of weeks or months, then remaking it doesn't make any sense. Like you want to design it properly, but I guess like it's just a whole different ballpark. It's you're, you're either going to, you're either dealing with something that you've never done before and that's why you're making it fast or you're, you're dealing with something that is going to last a thousand years.

2:03:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like the two prongs of programming what you're making will either be disregarded within a month or it'll last for 20 years. There is no in between.

2:03:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Change it when we need to change it. I'd argue that that's it. Everything else is secondary to those two things. If it does what it's meant to, and it's easy to change, then it's good code. This is not about engineering as art, or over-engineering, or software developers being over-precious about the beauty in their code. This is practical, pragmatic stuff. It works, and it's easy to...

2:03:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Does it remind you of Cohen?

2:03:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That one sentence, the past five seconds.

2:04:01 - Jorge Lewis 
rewind it this is practical pragmatic stuff it works and it's easy to change these things have a direct bottom line impact on the product I don't know just just like I feel like I've heard this definition for good code and what it takes to build good code and avoid traps in bad code based on some real-world example.

2:04:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the reason why it resonates, like, reminds me of Kuen is because it's trying to be technical from a completely non-technical perspective. Yeah, it's like Because writing good code takes effort, but effort is the product of our work. I feel like I'm hearing nothing, it's producing nothing, and it's going out as nothing.

2:04:56 - Speaker 2 
Argue that that's it. Everything else is secondary to those two things.

2:05:00 - Jorge Lewis 
That line right there, like, and that's it. Everything else is secondary. That line, like... Do these guys take the same adjusts, Chrome Master, Black Belt?

2:05:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's easy to change.

2:05:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is not so much the effects of something as hard to change.

2:05:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Like hard to change, bro. Make it a microservice. Like then you're, you technically have good code.

2:05:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

2:05:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Like if you make microservices, then it's easy. What was his two conditions?

2:05:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like, if you remember from the end of the other video, that one said, like, you shouldn't like, if it's a microservice or a monolith, it doesn't matter. But microservices are quite inherently difficult because you have to, structure in a way where it can be a microservice. Like, you know, the, the, for us with a depth, just having our Python API and the other thing, imagine having like another Python API for every single function that can be done. Yeah. Just to make it so that it's easy to interchange.

2:06:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'm saying bad code is good for, for most people, for most projects. When do I want to change my code? Like when, in what scenario do I want to change my code?

2:06:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. So, so I guess in with his definition, bad code is good because I want things to be like, I don't need, Because or it's assuming that making bad code is fast.

2:07:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Like that's what it's assuming because making things that are hard to change is fast. Like doesn't do its job. Like that just, that doesn't, that just, that's not even code.

2:07:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like code is, I mean, I think he's just using the term bad and going, yeah, but code that doesn't do its job. Of course that's bad.

2:07:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is actually from the other video as well. There's three of them.

2:07:36 - Jorge Lewis 
There's three of them and he pointed out two of them. I can't remember.

2:07:50 - Speaker 2 
I'd argue that that's it. Everything else is secondary to those two things. If it does what it's meant to and it's easy to change, then it's good code. This is not about engineering as art or over-engineering or software developers being over-precious about the beauty in their code. This is practical, pragmatic stuff. It works and it's easy to change. These things have a direct bottom line impact on the productivity as well as quality of the systems that we build. If you want to go quickly and build lots of features, you don't get to do that by cutting corners and writing bad code fast. You do it by working more carefully to create good code from the start. And so saving lots of unnecessary time and effort correcting the fallout that your bad code caused later on. I wish that more of us techies believed that and defended that idea more strongly to misguided people pressuring us to cut corners.

2:08:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can I make one comment here? Because cutting corners simply doesn't work.

2:08:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
So he's arguing that creating this bad code, this hard to change code, is something that will directly affect the bottom line, down the line, because it's something that will have to be changed. But I'd argue having to change it and it affecting the bottom line is a great sign of its success. If your codes that you've wrote that's hard to change is used so much that you have to rewrite it, that's a great piece of code. And it's great that you've got it out there.

2:09:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I can see your point.

2:09:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
When you have the funds to do a massive rewrite, which affects the bulk of this thing that was created before, that was created in a hard-to-change way, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. If you are in the position where you have to change old code, yeah, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

2:10:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because that means you're in Dora data.

2:10:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Says that teams that produce higher quality code are significantly more efficient overall, spending 44% more of their time.

2:10:34 - Jorge Lewis 
I wonder where this came from That has to be enterprises.

2:10:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:10:45 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's interesting because this guy, whoever he is, saying this, you have to understand his audience are people like Chinmay, Biwas, and just people that, like programmers. And a majority of them don't work at enterprises. They work at, if it's a medium company, then sure. But if they're either doing their own projects or they're doing, they're working at a startup or at an agency as a freelancer, then this just does not apply to them. If anything, it's the opposite.

2:11:21 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm producing new features than teams that don't. 44%, that's a big win. Quality matters for commercial reasons because we go faster overall and we create better.

2:11:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I don't, how does that?

2:11:39 - Jorge Lewis 
44% their time.

2:11:42 - Jorge Lewis 
How does this work? Like, so it's saying...

2:11:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
High-performing organizations, so yeah, enterprises. Done 22% less time on unplanned work than reworked as a result.

2:11:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:12:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I feel like this data, this is...

2:12:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
I feel like this is someone that implemented agile with their 25 meetings per week. And the actual work that's being done, yeah, it's always on like the task they planned, but the time they took to plan it is probably like a 200% like that's hidden from this graph because here they're only considering unplanned work and planned work. Also, if they were planning the work, if they included one more for like how much time is spent planning the work, I'd love to see that.

2:12:37 - Jorge Lewis 
It's okay. So there's also the big thing I think is reworking. When you're reworking, you're forgetting that it provided so much, it provided value like with, Like you're reworking it because it provided value, like going off your point. If it didn't provide value, we wouldn't be reworking it. But if it was perfect, so what would be the downside of making it perfect? Is you would risk spending time, well.

2:13:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
You only know what perfect is in the scenario where you have to rework it. That's when you have enough context to like properly do it.

2:13:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

2:13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
And that's when you're making things that have been done before. So, but like, that's when you're making things that have been done before and you have reference to that. So you're in an enterprise where you can refer to a bug that took 20 hours of somebody else's time to solve. And you can just look at their log, like their log that they took eight hours to make. But if you're in a startup looking at a stack overflow that someone spent two minutes writing, that's not going to help you make a perfect solution.

2:13:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's very applicable. Reworks are kind of necessary in smaller, in anything but enterprise or at least in anything innovative because you will not have, like whatever you're making has not been done to the T before. If it has then what are you doing? Then you're doing something like error handling which you should learn Right Yeah, like I mean if Okay, for example when for us we're storing our messages our AI messages on a database instead of caching them on a writer server or whatever If whatever we are making right now, this chatbot, this adapt, or this chatbot that relies heavily on long-term data where the time of day matters a lot, the number of sessions per day matters a lot, and et cetera, then we would just implement their solution. And we'd have kind of a perfect solution because they iterated on it so many times before.

2:15:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I'd say every case, that's not the case. You're either using a different stack, you have one feature that's different that affects the rest of it. So rework is almost always necessary at anything but enterprise level. At medium scale businesses, even there, even enterprise businesses, at most points you've reworked.

2:15:34 - Jorge Lewis 
like when you don't rework we're talking about like UI and like frontend and and like I don't know maybe I don't know what I'm talking about I'm producing new features than teams that don't 44%, that's a big win.

2:15:51 - Speaker 2 
Quality matters for commercial reasons because we go faster overall and we create better quality code. So as software professionals, we have a professional duty of care to do a good job. This is not about self-indulgence or over-engineering. This is what we are paid to do, our professional duty of care to build software as efficiently as we can.

2:16:15 - Jorge Lewis 
To do that, we need So this was relying on the assumption that if you make better code, it'll save time in the long run, which is not the case for us.

2:16:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I kind of disagree with that. Like fundamentally coming back to my point, like if I, like if my employee wrote a piece of code that was so important that we have to rework it, that's great.

2:16:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
If that costs us time down the line, that means it made us enough money to where we're spending money on fixing it and making it better.

2:16:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like if REST didn't bring the value that it did, I wouldn't be working on it right now.

2:17:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I don't want an employee to spend more time than they have to on a piece of code, which could be from the trash or could be over optimized in some way. I want them to focus on the core value. Just implement that. Don't make it scalable. Don't make it clean. Don't make it in a way where we can improve on it. Just make it. If it works great, then we invest in it.

2:17:25 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's like for me, so, and also I think it's more enjoyable making things from again, rather than improving your, like Rather than improving something that was structured before you knew the end goal.

2:17:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or before you knew what it looked like in practice more accurately.

2:17:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:17:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Need to build high quality software, not create crap quickly. Because if we optimize to build...

2:17:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I like crap quickly.

2:17:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:17:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
If it's working crap, that's so valuable, I need to rework it.

2:18:04 - Jorge Lewis 
If you make working crap, you're a good programmer. I think that's the title. If you make working crap, that you're a good programmer. A good programmer is someone that does the best for their time.

2:18:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me pause there and say thank you to everyone.

2:18:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to start saying that to everybody.

2:18:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not working, valuable. If you make crap so valuable, we have to rework it. That's it.

2:18:41 - Jorge Lewis 
But when you're saying valuable, it's so ambiguous. Working, it's more clear. Cause it's like, what does working mean? And this relies on them understanding what is the, like, what do we need from this whole system?

2:18:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
But you get what I'm saying?

2:18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like we need, we don't, we don't need anything good.

2:19:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
We are extreme. You start the routine. I support void it. Here is chat. GPTs take on defining bad code. It's not perfect, but it's also not a bad summary either. So if bad code is hard to maintain.

2:19:22 - Jorge Lewis 
It's it's just these buckets are just.

2:19:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Like who made these buckets? Or who made who? Why is this unscalable code bad? It's not because like,

2:19:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, I'd agree with these, that these are the ones that are generally considered bad code though. What do you think about the security? Like if, if one of our employees coded something that like used, for example, server authenticated code on the front end, which just is impossible to use in production, but it's working and doing kind of the things it's supposed to. What do you think then?

2:20:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because it's very easy to speed up development of features by ignoring authentication as an example, by ignoring row-level security, by ignoring all those things.

2:20:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
That lets you ship a lot faster, or that lets you get to a point where the application is working and the ship will stay much faster. But it will be very insecure.

2:20:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you'll have to fix that before shipping to production.

2:20:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Then clearly it isn't easy to change. If it has scalability issues, then it doesn't really work as it's meant to. And all of these other things also fall into my two categories of doing what it's meant to, and then being easy to change.

2:21:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Which I think are the simple and more foundational...

2:21:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like a lot of these... He's, he's, I feel like at this, this is the point of the video where experience doesn't do its job.

2:21:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
If it, like, if I need a feature, which is innovative, a feature, which hasn't been made before, and you make it work with like HTML, no CSS looks, I don't care. You made the feature work. We can improve upon it then. Like we know it works. We know it's valuable. We can improve upon it.

2:21:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not, not doing its job.

2:21:53 - Jorge Lewis 
How about this? This whole title is wrong because what your code looks like has no correlation to how good a programmer you are.

2:22:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'd argue somewhat it does, because a lot of what dictates how your code looks like, it's just how much you know about the language. But at a certain point, it doesn't matter anymore. Like, do you know how to error handle? Yes, then it'll look better. No, then it'll look worse. And it'll dictate if you're good. But it's not the thing that dictates if you're good. It's just an indicator of experience for yourself.

2:22:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like a good programmer knows error handling in general. A good programmer knows typing in general. So.

2:22:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, for.

2:22:54 - Jorge Lewis 
You know, for example, like, Like so. Take REST as an example. I just got into Lanchain at that time and just got into, that was my first personal project for Install Kit. The code was terrible, but I would still say at that point I was a good programmer.

2:23:22 - Jorge Lewis 
My code looked like I was a first time TypeScript developer, but if you took someone that has been developing for 50 years, They could see the patterns of, oh, this guy understood this principle of this and this. So, yeah, I didn't do proper typing. I used any. I didn't use nulls. I used question marks. I didn't even try catches, though. Sorry, B-West.

2:23:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is a nitpick, but I disagree with the typing. I think that's just inexperienced with the language because no matter what I'm doing, I can do the typing properly because now I understand TypeScript typing so well that I can just like, I can get the LSP to tell me what I need to type like in two seconds. And then I type it and it makes me work faster because the intellisense helps me.

2:24:18 - Jorge Lewis 
But, but this, this, this statement saying if your code, is using any, you're a bad programmer. I wouldn't say I was a bad programmer, but I was using any.

2:24:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it just indicates your experience with the specific programming language more so than if you're a good programmer or not.

2:24:38 - Jorge Lewis 
And it also depends at what experience level, how long you've been doing that, and if you're still doing the same things that you were doing a year ago. Like I stopped using any after that one project because I learned it since then. So it's like, for example, if you're using try and catch, if no one tells you to learn error handling, you will always use try and catch.

2:25:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
And more useful ideas. Fundamentally good code needs.

2:25:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

2:25:05 - Jorge Lewis 
It just comes back to the point of how your experience affects the statement. Like if you're a junior engineer, I would say that. The code you make, if we make the same code as a junior and a senior, it's a whole different world. Because as a senior, I understand the principles going on behind everything. I'm trying catching so I can save this five minutes so that I can just see my output. You're trying catching because you don't know how to air handle. Or you don't know that there is air handling.

2:25:45 - Jorge Lewis 
At some point you want to learn things and to make your code better. You could say like error handling and using classes when you should and that just comes with experience. I'd argue against that one.

2:25:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
The using classes when you should, when to use classes over time. Functions and state and sub-stores, for example. I think that's just all opinion pieces. It's all going to be opinion pieces.

2:26:11 - Jorge Lewis 
No, that's what I just said. It's experience. You gain an intuitive feeling of, oh, I want to use a class here. Why? It feels better.

2:26:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe, but I think the arrow hunting is more set in stone. But the classes, I think it's almost going to be like, it'll flip back and forth depending on experience. You just start out, you don't even know classes or anything. You learn about classes, classes are great, always use classes. You learn when to use them, okay, never use classes. Then you learn object-oriented programming, use classes. Then you learn, oh, functional programming is a thing, never use classes. Then you just flip that. Error handling is like, when you learn it, now I can do it.

2:27:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and then you always do it. Or at least you do it better every time. For me, the first time I did error handling, The first time I did error handling, I just checked if error. And then as I went on, I was like, okay, if error or if no data, okay, if error, then do this, like you just learn over time. Um, but like, for example, the, for the point of like, where things are just ambiguous, like when should I use a class? One of our team members working on, on, um, on a simulation feature, he was like, he used a recursive function over a for loop. So I asked him, we pseudocoded a for loop, why have you changed it to a recursive function? And he was like, hmm, we could do both. We could do a for loop. And I was like, yeah, we could. Why do you use a recursive function? He couldn't really come to an answer.

2:27:58 - Jorge Lewis 
In the actual scenario, I would say they're about even in terms of pros and cons. But it's just a matter of me, I would use a for loop. And I would say I'm more experienced than him. So you could say the better answer is a for loop. But at that point, I'm not helping him by saying you should use a for loop. I'm just saying, OK, cool. Why did you use a recursive function instead? And then he's trying to think it through for himself. And then I'm like, OK, cool. The next time he's working on something similar, he'll think again, oh Jorge asked me that one time, should I be using a recursive function or for loop?

2:28:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm going to be honest, I've never ever made a recursive function outside of what's a recursive function.

2:28:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
I haven't either.

2:28:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've never made a recursive function like that. I think you can just achieve the same thing with a for loop and being smart about the flow state.

2:29:08 - Jorge Lewis 
But you see, he's done these code questions, so he was thinking recursive function, binary tree, binomal ethereal.

2:29:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing is, if he used that because that was a solution he had in his head, great. But if he used a recursive function over a for loop, which he would have done better, if that's the scenario, then it's kind of bad. But I'm guessing just because he does those code questions and that, the recursive function was just natural to him.

2:29:44 - Jorge Lewis 
And just as long as I prompt the question in his head, Because what's default to him is the recursive functions. But we should be promoting the critical thinking where should I be doing this or this? That's all we have to do. We can let him do the rest. And that's like classes. Should I be using a class or should I not?

2:30:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Play devil's advocate there. That's not where critical thinking matters. That's where like, if I, if I like, that's the reason I've never used recursive functions because like, to me, it's always using a recursive function. The only purpose would be to make it fancier, to make it prettier because I can achieve everything I need to with for loops. And those were great. I've never needed recursive functions. I've tried them out.

2:30:34 - Jorge Lewis 
like there hasn't been scenarios where Yeah, how no we've had to have made a recursive function, but just not realize like we've had to know we've we've had like We just I don't want to think that I've made a

2:30:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
recursive function once and it was in a recursive function tutorial and You see where I'm coming from, like, I don't know if that's where we need to promote critical thinking because then they'll be hung up and should I use a for loop here or a poster function? Well, you should just use what's natural. Like it doesn't matter.

2:31:15 - Jorge Lewis 
They do that. That thought process will become natural at a point where it's like, should I make a class or not? Um, yeah. And there's, Sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's subconscious, where you have reasons, you're like, okay, I've reused this thing three times and I want to make it on property, I want to add a function to it.

2:31:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think for that kind of question, what it really comes down to is which will be easiest to implement, which do I think will be the best one to work with in the future, and which one do I want to learn more about. For me, If I want to use the class in TypeScript, I know I'm going to be slower. I don't know if it's going to be easier to work with in the future. So it's likely going to be because I wanted to learn how to use classes more.

2:32:06 - Jorge Lewis 
You know, I've never made, I've made like probably one class in TypeScript.

2:32:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. It's like, you don't need them.

2:32:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
You don't really need passes at all, you just need objects.

2:32:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Objects and then you just hammer out the object until it's in the correct form. You don't need to attach the functions to the object. Like, yeah, that's the whole thing with functional programming. Oh yeah, we've got a lot left of the video.

2:32:33 - Jorge Lewis 
The next one is big premature optimization. Oh.

2:32:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Everything else is just a special case of those two things. It's possible that I'm being a little bit overly reductive here, but in this case, I don't really think so, because I can make my code scalable or write it to eliminate security vulnerabilities, and it still might be bad code if it's hard to maintain or offers a poor user experience. So if you fix all of these things, is the code good now? Well, maybe, maybe not. To achieve good code, our code needs to fix all of these.

2:33:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know how true this is, but it's just a thought. How do you know what is maintainable? That's like, we're talking about the future. How do you know the future? Like if we're talking about a, like you just don't like, or at least in all of my experiences, like for rest, there would be no way.

2:33:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or I think there are tools which objectively keep things more maintainable.

2:33:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, like for example using...

2:33:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Code localized to where it's used. Like instead of using a utils.ts folder where you dump every single function, keep the functions where they're used. That just makes it more maintainable.

2:33:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like also using JSON in a database versus its own columns. Like these small things, but it's...

2:34:04 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a very small example where it's just something we learn over time. Like if you see someone using a utils function and putting it in its own file, you'd tell them, hey, you're using this twice. Just, I don't know, just kind of put it in the code maybe.

2:34:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think those things like Making that bad code into good code isn't more effort though. It's just I have more experience now. The effort was learning.

2:34:36 - Jorge Lewis 
It's all just coming down to experience. Good code, there's no good code or bad code. It's just experienced, like experienced and not experienced.

2:34:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that's the realization we're coming to.

2:34:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not that ugly code is good code or beautiful code is good code. It's just, it'll be what you're most experienced with. Like if we told B was to make the most beautiful codes, it wouldn't even be close to what our bad code is, if that makes sense. It's hard to pinpoint the statement, you know.

2:35:18 - Jorge Lewis 
It's I feel like we could make a can we be able to concisely summarize what we have now into probably like three different rules where it's like, okay, yeah, it needs to accomplish the task. But it relies on, like it just there's something we have something here now we have we have like an idea that we're trying to get to which is it all comes down to your experience and it's just there's we've discussed a lot of good things and we just now need to figure out a way to articulate and that's always the hardest part these things, and depending on the context, probably several more not listed here.

2:36:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
If uptime matters a lot to my business, I was asking the same thing.

2:36:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you get one week to do something, and you make it one time each day, compared to if you're trying to make the perfect thing over the whole week, which will give the best outcome.

2:36:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and I was thinking of like could we try the experiment with like our developers to we should we tell them spend three hours Making one code and do that three times versus making one project like we have has nine chin may be west nazif And me five developers. Let's say three make three of them spend one full day making a project and then two of them make three small projects, and then at the end of it, ask them to make a new project. Just the similar study that they did, but with code. I wonder how that would do. But we'd have to do it, it'd have to be in something totally new, like a new language, a new everything, so that everyone is, so that I could obviously, we need to do it at scale probably. Maybe we could try that study out sometime, as just a fun, interesting thing. Cause it's, it's something like that can prove a good point.

2:37:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing about it is. If you did the like projects just quickly once you wouldn't learn error handling, you wouldn't learn type handling. You'd just use any across all of them because you're doing free quick projects. You don't have time to go.

2:37:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So, like I said earlier, when did I learn that?

2:37:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because I've always, I've always seen the vector inside of ourselves, which kind of just goes, Hey, this is something that was a good time.

2:37:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:37:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, Junduz has nagged me enough about this. Maybe I should learn this.

2:38:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, like what made me nag to you about using any and not nag to you about your horrible file structures, for example?

2:38:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like, I was trying to pick something that I haven't even gone into. Like, when I look at your code, I just immediately go, bruh, Annie, bruh, horrible error handling. I don't care what the code does. These two things can be improved.

2:38:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it also when I experience the problem of that bad code, like when I'm not logging, typing an error, do I experience the problem that is solved by typing things? That I'm like, oh, typing would solve this.

2:39:03 - Jorge Lewis 
When did I realize types were good? Because before this, before TypeScript, I was, I didn't like types. I liked my Python dynamic types. I was like, huh, statically typed types. Come on.

2:39:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Why would I not want to make my industry when you type like a profile dot and then the whole list of things that could be. Yeah.

2:39:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:39:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

2:39:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Because now I can very clearly explain to someone why I use TypeScript and not, or why I use types and not use types. But it's, I think it's just from experience, but it's, there has to be something that I can say where it's like, because this, so I started using types, like, because I've seen this error. So I started using types, but I don't think there is like, so this is where you tried it out and you liked it.

2:39:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:39:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So this is where it'd be helpful. Just documenting where you just really get to understand what happened in the thought process. So like with starting business, if I wanted to do another one, I would not be able to understand why we, and I learned this thing without documenting it through the process. Like I right now understand why I use types, but I don't understand how I got here.

2:40:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, let's, it's already 3am.

2:40:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Resilience may be a much more important defining characteristic.

2:40:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think so. Going over the, there's quite a lot left to go over. If we want to, yeah, if we want to go into like proper conversations, like we have been instead of just speed running the rest, I think it's best with a part two.

2:40:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe we've discussed enough so that I can write a script.

2:40:58 - Jorge Lewis 
It's never going to be perfect. My video that I'm going to publish tomorrow night, I am by no means proud, if anything but

2:41:09 - Jorge Lewis 
of my video I made on Monday and edited it since a couple of days ago. Shots are way overexposed. The frame rates aren't matching.

2:41:26 - Jorge Lewis 
The audio is so terrible. But it's not a matter of making that perfect. It's just I'm going to publish that and publish the next one better than that. So with this video, and I don't know if you've realized this yet, but when you watch your YouTubers, you don't remember their first video. You remember what you're watching now. Um, like your first videos, no one will remember, like your friends and people will remember because like, Oh, you know, or how do I explain it? So I don't want to share this video I'm going to make with my, my friends from high school because they're going to be like, Oh wow, this guy sucks. You know? And At some point, they're not my audience anyways, but at some point, my real audience is never going to see my first few videos. The real people that are going to be watching me every day.

2:42:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
But I think it's important for yourself to upload it still, because then when you publish your next video, who you should be comparing yourself to is yourself.

2:42:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Is that previous video.

2:42:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Exactly. You shouldn't be comparing yourself to other videos.

2:42:30 - Jorge Lewis 
I take it down when I post a better one.

2:42:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Don't even take it down, just keep it working up and be able to compare to yourself in the past rather than comparing yourself to other YouTubers.

2:42:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, I mean, just in terms of like more technically, you probably want to archive it or at least private it because just it represents your image.

2:42:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:42:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Also being able to show yourself improve over time is good though.

2:42:59 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that's done other ways. I don't know. But who cares?

2:43:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
So no one's going to look back at your old ones.

2:43:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So the only person that's going to notice how you improved over time is your long-term fans, which if they're long-term fans, you don't, they don't need the other, the older videos published and yourself and yourself.

2:43:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
People that go, Hmm, I wonder how this guy was in his beginning. And then they can be like, amazing. Like, wow, he, he, he came from this, but what's the term glow up.

2:43:40 - Jorge Lewis 
He glowed up.

2:43:47 - Jorge Lewis 
At the cost of sacrificing your professional or your high quality image though.

2:43:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Does it? I wouldn't see that as a negative.

2:44:02 - Jorge Lewis 
That's interesting, yeah. Like for example one person that I watch when like every video he posts is this guy called Daniel Dallin Which I realized His the person managing his social media like his whole thing Is a person that I watched like for a long long time, and it's this guy. He's like 17 years old He's been doing social media for like a long time And I was like there's no way like it just feels like it's so weird that type of circle But anyways, I need to meet this guy by the way. Let me send you this video or his channel. He lives in Hong Kong And he's the fastest growing entrepreneur right now on YouTube.

2:44:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Wow.

2:44:37 - Jorge Lewis 
He's about to reach a hundred K.

2:44:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
How do you measure that?

2:44:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, well it's very obvious.

2:44:47 - Jorge Lewis 
He's like his, his, his iconic, um, or, or his thumbnail is iconic. His POV thumbnail.

2:45:01 - Jorge Lewis 
You might have seen it actually around. Yeah, like where he just puts the letters POV in white on his thumbnails. And everyone has been using it.

2:45:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:45:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he lives in Stockholm.

2:45:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are we doing part two later?

2:45:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Part two, if necessary. I'm gonna... See what I can write from all we have here.

2:45:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we can do like make little, yeah, if you're interested in watching the next of this guy's video, links in the description.

2:45:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Since we ain't finishing it today.

2:45:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I'm gonna see what I can, I can muster up in a script. If I can explain, I hate making these videos because I want to make it so perfect that I don't want anything to be wrong. Like I don't want to be like, But it's just like things you have to publish.

2:46:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's painfully close to what we've been discussing today. Like the bad code versus good code. You just gotta do it like many times and then that'll be more valuable than doing it once.

2:46:19 - Jorge Lewis 
But perfect. Yeah. Like I can republish, I can remake this video and the third time it'll take me three hours to make rather than 20. That's an exaggeration, but like, because I understand the point of view, like the script's already going to be there. I'm just going to refine it and I'm just going to edit this. I I'm going to, I'm not doing the editing myself, but anyways.

2:46:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:46:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. A little B was yeah.

2:46:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah...

2:46:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Is anyone on? Will's been on the whole day today, by the way. Oh, okay. Yeah. Been nice. And I got two updates from him today. That's the most I've ever gotten. Ever.

2:47:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you have a talk with him?

2:47:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, no.

2:47:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
No? No?

2:47:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:47:15 - Jorge Lewis 
To do... He added me, but he didn't add me.

2:47:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, he did at Jorge, but it wasn't like my profile.

2:47:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
I guess that's it then. Better get going to sleep.

2:47:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I've been having some crazy dips between, you'll see this in my video tomorrow, I talked about it, between five and seven, which is the time I work out. So I've started doing, which I mean, I have been trying to do this and you probably know from the start, getting back to Hong Kong, I don't want to be waking up as like at 12. I want to be waking up at least at 10. That's already late. Normal people wake up around 8. Exactly. 10 is already like bruh.

2:48:20 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's not only what's the social stigma, but it's like the actual physical things, like your body is already shaking.

2:48:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have to get up at 5.30am to Tuesday.

2:48:37 - Jorge Lewis 
For what?

2:48:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have to go to the DLT and get my printed license. The driver's license. I've only got like temporary papers at the moment.

2:48:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I got a thumbs up from the Huberman. You know Huberman? Andrew Huberman?

2:48:57 - Jorge Lewis 
No.

2:48:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Nay.

2:49:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Baddest names. It'll be nice to have first driver's license though, in hand. Card I can travel with too. Like I can travel in hand now without passport or everything. Just driver's license.

2:49:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Interesting.

2:49:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:49:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like a full on like Thai passport basically or passport just for Thailand.

2:49:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That's the Andromeda I sent you in your PM.

2:49:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
I see. The Guardian says wellness bro, which is like the people I, I avoid. So yeah.

2:49:41 - Jorge Lewis 
No, he, he is the only wellness bro I will listen to. Oh my mama.

2:49:48 - Jorge Lewis 
This guy's a, he's a goat. I mean, you know, Lex Freeman, right?

2:49:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
No.

2:50:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, bro.

2:50:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah, I do. I got it in three years.

2:50:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, man, this this Andrew human is like the he has this podcast of relating to health. I watched like three episodes back like a few years ago. I'm just not a big podcast guy. I don't know.

2:50:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, his content is great. But anyways, I watched a summary video made by this third party dude. And it was, he said, at least sleep well for 80% of your nights. And for the rest of the nights, at least have a good reason.

2:50:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Because before, I would stress so much about getting my sleep every single night that it would make my sleep actually worse. And it would make me just like not... Live happily. So now that he said at least 80% of your life, I can spend one night a week with bad sleep and at least I'll be okay.

2:50:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe, but it's like, if you listen to the doctors, they say, like, one hour miss takes, or what is it? Yeah, one hour miss takes seven days to get back. He is the doctor.

2:51:11 - Jorge Lewis 
He's the, one of the leading guys on the whole, well, besides Matthew Walker, on like the whole sleep thing.

2:51:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

2:51:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
So are you supposed to wake up at the same time the next day just for less hours or? I don't know.

2:51:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's just the most realistic thing to do. Like not stress. Like 80% one day a week is pretty realistic. Like that's like, Oh, you're going out with your friends or you're just, that's pretty realistic. Like one day you have, you sleep two hours later. I don't know. Just.

2:51:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'd like to know if I should wake up the same time or if I should wake up two hours later.

2:51:59 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what I've wondered. So tonight, should I wake up later and then the next day you you Like, the normal time? Or should I wake up at the same time and cut the sleep?

2:52:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, which one's better?

2:52:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, because I've always heard that you should always wake up at the same time when you go to bed, can vary, but always wake up at the same time. That's what I've heard. Your like mind clock singles in on that time no matter when you go to sleep your mind will just wake you up at the correct time and that's how you're supposed to work.

2:52:34 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll send you the video I watched it was like a very concise I think it was four minute or I mean I put on what speed but it was just yeah the wake-up time is the most important but I have another question is Does your wake up time also depend on like a 90 minute cycle? Like, can I move it around within maybe not 90 minutes? I think, I don't think so, but like 20 minutes, like a 30 minutes.

2:52:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
It is the 90-minute cycle, but from my experience, before I was obsessed about the 90-minute cycle, I always changed my alarm to match with when I went to sleep plus 30 minutes. But what I realized was that when I set my alarm to the same time every morning, no matter what part of the cycle I'm in, my body just goes, well, that's it. I wake up consistently like 20 minutes before my alarm.

2:53:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll send you the video I watched. It has a good explanation. Each of your cells has its own timer. It's interesting. I want to I mean, I'll probably end up waking up later than usual. But just so you know, for most days, I probably want to be waking up at least at 10. I want to see with Chinmay if we can schedule times throughout the day to catch up so I can wake up at maybe nine.

2:53:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
But yeah.

2:53:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, what do you think about when your body just naturally wakes up consistently, like 15, 20 minutes before you're alone?

2:53:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I haven't gotten, some days I, I usually never wake up before my alarm or if I do, I force myself back to sleep. But since I've gotten back to Hong Kong, I've done that like a couple of times and that's like super shocking to me. I'm like, wait a minute, what? Like I just, I just, I woke up and I felt rested and I was like, wait, what time is it? Yeah, I'm 30 minutes before. All right, let's just start the day. Usually I'm like, no, I need my sleep. And I go back to sleep. Like, but it's just, Yeah. See, that's the problem where I get where it's just like, I need, I need the sleep. And then you, you just.

2:54:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've heard of it. Like when you, when you wake up and it's like less than an hour before your alarm, you should just get up because it's. Yeah.

2:54:46 - Jorge Lewis 
But I don't have my alarm or my phone next to my, or a clock next to my bed. So I have to wake up to stand up and that's already got me woken up. So I usually just, if I wake up before, I'm like, no, it's not time. Go back to sleep. I should probably fix that. Bro, I can't wait for my optic fiber. A thousand megabits per second. Inshallah. I could go to 2,500. You're like about to maybe move out the second you get there.

2:55:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I could stay here for as long as I want, I think. So, well, maybe not as long as I want, but at least for a little bit. Like, even if your parents leave?

2:55:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
You just keep the house warm?

2:55:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, they'd probably let me stay here for like a month. And then they'd be like, okay, we need to start pulling some rent from it.

2:55:42 - Jorge Lewis 
But even then, the next two weeks, or like, they're going to decide, I think, in two weeks. So I'll have like a month, if they're going to be here for a month. So I'll have at least a month of just, a gigabyte per second speed. Oh man.

2:55:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's never truly one gigabyte. It's like slightly lower always.

2:56:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. But like comparing that to my 20 megabits per second download and my 0.5 megabits upload. I felt like that.

2:56:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is so bad in Hong Kong.

2:56:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's no, it's cause I'm using 5g and it's like, We're just, we're, we have trees next to me. So it's like, it's not like it's reaching anything.

2:56:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but how is there no fiber in the whole thing? Like your pipe looks like Thailand, right? Like, or it looks like Southeast Asia.

2:56:32 - Jorge Lewis 
It does. The optic fiber is running through the the telephone poles and it just took them so long to do it because They were just lazy like the company was just lazy. They were like Seeds because it's their their offices aren't where we are. So they have to send someone out and do it But now enough people called them saying hey, we need optic fiber. We need cable. Oh So now our entire village, if you pay attention, there's cables running everywhere and it looks so bad if you notice.

2:57:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's the same thing here in Thailand. There's all like thousands of cables.

2:57:14 - Jorge Lewis 
But those are power cables. Isn't that even uglier? That's worse, that's worse.

2:57:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But I guess Thailand is like the third world, so Hong Kong is one of the richest cities in the world.

2:57:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is your village, like, does it even compare to how rich the actual city is?

2:57:36 - Jorge Lewis 
The real estate, no. The people, yes. Because it's the most quiet area. Where do rich retired people want to go? Not the city.

2:57:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Fair enough. But the real estate, how's it?

2:57:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cheap?

2:57:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it's about like 1.2 per house mill. And then like, uh, 4,500 month rent for our house. That's what we'd be listing it at.

2:58:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's 4,000. Okay.

2:58:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I heard 450 when I was like, Look what I got got my little I actually got all my equipment sent from Amazon a couple days ago got my light Just charging now this tripod. It's a beast What else that's it?

2:58:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Why would you want it to bend that much? Like I feel like from tripod, I'd want it to not bend that much so that I know it's like correct. Does that make sense? If it bends that much, I'm relying on my, me, myself getting it level.

2:58:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so for example, if I want to hook it up on those bars up here, I can like wrap it around and then get a nice aerial view. Or if I want to hook it up to my monitor up top, like I just literally just bang.

2:59:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's just up, you can like hook it.

2:59:09 - Jorge Lewis 
That's the benefit. Yeah. Like, like it's just there already, like done. And then I can fine tune it on my phone. I have the grid lines and like the, what do you call it? Like the things that tell me if it's aligned or not.

2:59:25 - Jorge Lewis 
But like it's just it's just and and I can use it as like a stick as well or what do you call it? Selfie stick just bang I Do have normal tripods as well. I've got the full-size one here These are all from like before by the way, they're just sitting in the house and I have this from Antopia this trusty boy I Think that one's made its debut already a couple of times on my channel I But this thing I'm in love like it's just I slot my phone in and then although I'm this was a bad idea. My phone has MagSafe which it's a magnet so it sticks instead of this annoying thing where I have to put it in.

3:00:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways.

3:00:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Guess that's it though. Gotta get out of this thing.

3:00:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes sir. Our whole team is going to be on tomorrow and we're going to be like helping out like three in the afternoon. Hey good morning guys.

3:00:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, it ain't too late for me. I'm like, gonna be an hour late to sleep.

3:00:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'm already too...

3:00:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
probably gonna be. If we think about it in UTC though, we both should be waking up around the same time. Because we're going to sleep at the same time.

3:00:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wow.

3:00:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Look at the white balancing it does on my face.

3:00:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

3:00:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, wow. Yeah, you just got more information.

3:00:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Wow, that's very impressive. I'm learning all about this thing on my phone. I've got the Blackmagic cam app.

3:01:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Man, this camera, I'm just... Every time I think about that this was worth $1,300, I'm like, wow. But then I realized how much value I've gotten out of it with just work and everything. It's like, yes, that's worth it. And soon, in a month or two, they'll release their AI features, and I'll be able to use them on this phone. All right, let's go get our PC. I'll see you later. Thanks for your time. See you later. Bye. Bye-bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (12).txt"

Sat, Aug 17, 2024

2:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Jorge, basically just to run you down on what he's said until now is that he's looking to resign at the other job in conclusion, and that he wants to move over to ours in full time, but he hasn't had the opportunity.

2:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's the gist of it.

2:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, he's not here yet. Yeah, he's currently trying to join.

2:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then he started kind of telling the story from the moment he got the Uber job and was going over it, but then his connection just died at the same time as he was starting. So it's good that you joined so that you can also get the story.

3:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, can you join Google Meet?

3:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Already joining? OK.

3:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, hello.

3:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, how are you? No, the connection seems to be bad. The one on gather was just bad.

3:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll be turning off my gather for now.

3:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, go ahead.

3:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, you were starting to go through the story. Do you want to just summarize what you've said already to me for Jorge, so that he has the context?

4:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

4:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I'll be turning off my camera too, if it's okay, for internet.

4:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
The internet seems to be fine, huh?

4:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, okay.

4:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In which case, just a short summary. I got accepted at this server admin job in around May, and then Jorge contacted me around June, which I was actually not able to respond because I got kidney stones during the first days, but my initial plan back then was to work at Stardino during the times that I'm also working at this other company. I kept it as a secret because In our local culture, working two jobs is often times from the pot, by the employer.

5:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So that's primarily the reason why I kept it as a secret.

5:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, that's where I left off.

5:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
We're already going to be discussing the ways forward, like the schedules.

5:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is it right, Jonas? Yeah.

5:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
You also mentioned that you were planning to resign at the auto company, right?

5:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh yeah, absolutely.

5:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm gonna send the resignation paper either next week, Monday, or next week, Tuesday.

5:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
One of the main issues that we've had with your time here at Cirquino has just been your presence, even during your work hours. You've just seemed like you've been on a different wavelength, like in meetings, you're tired, closing your eyes all the time. Just seemed like you're about to sleep and otherwise just haven't been fully present, if that makes sense.

6:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think I've been called out about it a few times already. I'm pretty aware. And probably it's because of the overwork too. But then again, it kind of feels like I'm saying an excuse. So the way I move forward with it is probably to create a means for me to read the messages better and also connect with the other developers more often.

7:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's possibly my way forward.

7:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Personally, I feel like it's just kind of been the whole situation that's created the circumstances. If you're, as I explained earlier in Gather, if you're working from 7 a.m. In the morning till 9 p.m. In the evening every single weekday, there's no way all of those work hours will be efficient, you're going to be super tired. If you want any free time to spend in your weekdays, then you're going to be either missing hours or missing sleep. And if you're missing sleep on such a schedule where you're working every single hour of the day, you're not going to be working efficiently at all. I think that's the reason why you haven't been present fully.

8:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, other than that, I think one of my issues is I oftentimes lose track if I'm not writing notes of the meetings. That's a habit that I know works, but I don't strictly implement it.

8:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes, what?

8:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Write down notes, like notes of the meeting.

9:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think there's any specific thing like that that's been ditched.

9:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
What do you think, Jorge?

9:11 - Jorge Lewis 
It's like, it's hard to tell because Any behavior that we experienced from you was affected by your other job. So it's like, I can't say, oh, it's this. Oh, no, it's this. Because everything, oh, it's this, we could say it was because of that, but we don't know. So for all I know, my concern is that you leave this other job and you join us full time, and some of those issues still remain. And then we can say, oh, it wasn't because of the other job. It was because of something else.

9:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, good point.

10:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

10:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to think about it.

10:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, it's a bit hard.

10:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I hear what you're saying. It's a bit hard. For us to figure out what's going on or I guess for the both of you to figure out what's going on to see which ones are an issue related to the other company and which ones are just literally behavior related issues.

10:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would argue the other company plays a huge role especially with my activity in from morning to afternoon, not being able to respond to calls, not being able to be up on gather, those things are related to the other companies. However, like the times where I sometimes, I sometimes don't, like, fall too much attention to meetings, like I'm a bit, how do I say it properly, like, lightheaded? Is lightheaded a term?

11:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay.

11:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would argue that even though the other company might play a role there, with all the stress and all the stuff, I'm sensing that it's related to a behavioral tendency of mine to be a little bit lightheaded if I'm not writing down notes. Because this is a behavior I've observed for a long time already.

11:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Are you guys waiting for me or something?

12:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

12:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm just thinking.

12:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Everyone's like thinking. Yeah.

12:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Something you learn doing a lot of meetings is just being comfortable with silence.

12:26 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you think, Jorge?

12:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What are your takeaways?

12:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it'll be a great opportunity for you to grow as a developer, but there's also a risk that in the end it doesn't work out with us and then you'd be left in a bad spot. That's one of my concerns.

13:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
That's fair.

13:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think maybe it's because I'm overconfident in myself, but I honestly think I have the capacity to be hired in another job if everything goes wrong like I'm not that afraid of losing wait wait that sounds wrong I'm not afraid to lose no 30 um I'm not afraid of that prospect because I think it's easy for someone like me to be hired in a simple job like a simple server management a simple network like I'm not afraid of

13:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
losing your house or something.

13:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Basically.

13:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If all else fails, I can always be a fryer at McDonald's.

14:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
That is the way.

14:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
What we really need from people in Startino is a lot of self-initiative, a lot of wanting to move forward.

14:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
taking on responsibility and not relying on others, and I think if you're consumed with another job in addition to this job, and you're trying to optimise your time too much, what happens is you don't have the opportunity to have that self-initiative to over-deliver to take on responsibility to manage yourself, you end up just completing the things that are handed to you, and just that, and it's not in a proper timeframe either.

14:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
As an example, Chen Mei, especially when he started with us, when we got him on, like, and gave him a task. Usually he did the task and then over-delivered on it, looked into new avenues he suggested we go into, like, did a lot for us beyond just the task that we gave him. And that's only something that's possible to do if you have the time to do it. And if you have the mind space to go properly into it, you can't really get into that mind space if you're working a 18 day onto different things.

16:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Seems like well cut out again.

16:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe you can turn off your camera, we'll see if that helps.

17:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, hey, this might be.

18:01 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, the only thing I think is just, if he leaves his other job, there's a chance that he doesn't fit in here, and then he's going to have to find another job.

18:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he didn't seem too concerned over that, so I wouldn't feel that responsibility on my shoulders at least.

18:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, joined with the work account now, I think.

18:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, maybe using my phone will be a bit better.

18:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's sideways for me, but it's clear.

18:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, OK.

18:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, anything that you guys discussed without me?

18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Just to highlight it again, my concern is that we don't want the responsibility or the weight of having to keep you because you have no other job or because you left your other job for 13-0.

19:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
How do I say this?

19:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's not really that bad.

19:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, okay.

19:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here's how I think about the situation. Right now, I have a very... I basically have two options.

19:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I could probably focus more on Stardino.

20:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's a very simple job with not a lot of things to do. But my... But growth there is also minimal. Or I can focus on...

20:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I can focus on Startino, which I honestly believe would be a lot more stressful, but would force me to grow in ways I don't know. I could. I could possibly choose the other job for the sake of stability and some of the government benefits, but I honestly feel like five years down the line with them, or a year down the line with them, I would regret not taking this option because I won't grow as much. You feel me?

21:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And if, let's say, let's say, in a hypothetical universe that I actually don't align with the values in Startino, it's part of the business. At some point, at some point, yeah, there will be major differences that should be resolved immediately.

21:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There's nothing wrong about it, Para. Sorry, Filipino word, Para. Like, it's part of the game.

21:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, sorry if I keep putting in Filipino words.

21:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Only I will understand them. Yeah.

21:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
But basically, my stance is that I would prioritize Tartino mainly because I feel like I would be growing much better as a developer than stay at a typical server management job in a small company in Makati.

22:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah I resonate with that.

22:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
What about you Jorge?

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah I mean I think that's obvious, that's pretty obvious. Yeah.

22:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jorge do you want to hop in another call and just discuss them or want to remain here?

22:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is in Will's court now.

22:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

22:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's basically my court because... I have to make a choice? It's up to you. It's your decision.

22:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, I'm not gonna lie, guys, but like...

23:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although it's in my court, yeah, my decision is to be with Startino. Like, you guys still have the final say. Like, whatever your decision is, I have to respect it. No, not have. I will respect it.

23:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nonetheless.

23:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we don't have much of a decision right now. As you know, we're open for you to join full-time. That's how it was initially. So if you're able to actually be on full-time this time, then yeah, that's the way we would like to go and then see from there.

23:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although, I have a small request, Jorge, if ever I get full-time.

23:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I want to keep the up work, just lower my rate a little bit and to the proper amount of hours. I just realized how much it benefits me by letting me know how much I work for the day and how much hours I'm not actually doing productive things.

24:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, sure.

24:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's not a problem.

24:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I think we're pretty cool on that front.

24:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Would you like, Jonas, to have a little bit longer talk? I mean, a little bit longer coding session on Sunday to compensate the lack of coding we've done for today?

24:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

24:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can do it on Sunday instead.

24:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I was supposed to see Chinmay today, but he's not here.

24:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he's usually not on when you have scheduled pair programming with him.

24:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I see, like, Jorge is supposed to be pair programming with him. Oh, he's not on.

25:01 - Jorge Lewis 
To be fair, I hopped on, like, as it was supposed to start, because I didn't get a notification for this event. So I don't know. He hasn't put a thumbs up, so I think that's why. Yeah.

25:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, is it possible to move the Startino YouTube discussion, like, well, little bit earlier because it's like I prefer to go out for lunch like and it's currently like the right between over nothing that so it's like too early to go now and also it's too close but it's also very late to go oh we could do it later as well if it's Is everyone invited there or is it just the two of you?

25:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can just do it at that time.

25:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just take lunch at like 2pm then, I guess.

25:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know why I'm feeling so tired. I think it's because of the rain. It's been really rainy the past few days. So I'm going to go shower and then...

26:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe we can do it tomorrow?

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Ideally, I don't want to push it back anymore because it's already been quite a while. It's just a discussion. It's like, uh, it can, it can even be like, I mean, it'd probably be like an hour or maybe probably an hour and a half, the whole thing. We can just do it right now.

26:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't have enough energy for it. So if you want, you're on in the evening. Uh, yeah.

26:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think so, yeah. It's just that I'm not very awake during the evenings now because my sleep schedule was thrown back and forth.

26:42 - Jorge Lewis 
After lunch work then?

26:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Tomorrow morning I would. Today evening should work.

26:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
We can do after lunch as well.

27:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I just like to get some programming done then when I'm like awake or so.

27:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we could do tomorrow afternoon like, but like one.

27:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
What's that? So, so like 12.

27:21 - Jorge Lewis 
What time is your lunch on Sundays?

27:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Usually just go out like between 12 and or like 12. Yeah.

27:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
12 to 1.

27:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Usually I'm done with lunch right before stand-up.

27:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's do tomorrow at like 1 your time then, or 1.30ish.

27:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll move it.

27:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sounds good.

27:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll accept it. I'll accept the move. I wonder if Chinmay's gonna get in.

27:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, who put Balloon on my desk?

28:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh that wasn't you?

28:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
I thought it was you.

28:03 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I don't want balloons on my desk. 100% that was Beelze.

28:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Who had the time to put 4 balloons on my desk?

28:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Which one's Beelze's desk? Oh yeah this one.

28:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I tried to reschedule, what happened to it?

28:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Ah, okay, yeah.

28:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, okay, it's rescheduled now, then you get the notification.

28:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
It never asked me if I wanted to send or update it for other...

28:57 - Jorge Lewis 
I haven't gotten a notification, but...

28:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Copy to Jorge, say. For me it's still 1.30. Oh, I just added it to yours. And then...

29:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, now if you look at Sunday 18th, it should be there. 1 to 2 PM for me.

29:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, yeah. 2 to 3.

29:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Guys, is it okay if I early?

29:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
If you what? If I go early?

29:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

29:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Since I think I'm okay already. Do you guys have any questions for me or something?

29:38 - Jorge Lewis 
No, just whenever you can, posting an update about the signup would be good.

29:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, okay, wait, wait, wait.

29:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Good thing you brought that up.

29:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to the updates, I saw your announcement a while ago, but Are you expecting, like...

30:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Ah, okay, okay.

30:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In the channel user sign-up, do you have an expectation for me to provide an explanation still on what's happening on the auth?

30:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Because my initial assumption is that my updates are to be written in status, in the status subchannels.

30:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

30:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
In coordination with Chenmei.

30:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

30:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So put it from our perspective you're working for two days. I have no clue what you're actually developing I can hop in a call Which is which is what I do like here and there but kind of to put like as a baseline It would be good for everybody to be posting what they're working on and like in the technical channel so that I don't have to support them. For example, what I can do is I can spend a 10-minute checkup on everybody twice a day to gather the technical things, what's going on, are they doing the right solution, but then multiply that by three people and that's already a lot of time.

31:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In the Adaptive, I update what I'm working on and the status, I update what's the status for the feature I'm working on. Is that right?

31:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the features that are going to be deployed. It doesn't matter who's working on it.

31:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just what doesn't have to be crafted for current at all. It shouldn't be the problem. The reason has expected it to be is because you've also are us and everyone has been asking questions in the dev channel. We shouldn't be asking him anything in the dev channel. That's just for us. It's supposed to be showing him, Hey, we're working. Look at us. We're chatting. That's basically it. Yeah.

31:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Otherwise, what's in the status channel should be outcome focused. That should be what he can expect when. And it's to set expectations for him so that he knows what to expect when. It's not for him to put pressure on us or anything like that. It's just showing him when he should expect pain.

32:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think that's better.

32:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So basically, from what I'm hearing, we have to post two kinds of updates. One update, what we're working on. Second update, what's the status of the features assigned to us.

32:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
That update is for Jorge. Status updates are for Q&A.

32:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Jorge plus the rest of the team, because like, for example, Chinmay has no clue what you're working on for the signup page, but it would be helpful for him to know. Oh, he's working on the signup page. So when he's done with that, we could hook it up to the whole chat. Like it's just that type of communication is just needed for projects. Kuin sent a message to me in a private chat saying you guys have no overlap between your call times. I put call in bracket because I'm available like 12 hours a day so I just put the times that Kuin can reliably call me. I don't know what your guys' times are. Yeah, wait, let me see.

33:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If I remember correctly, we don't have a lot of overlapping hours too.

33:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have on my calendar when I can be called there's like book a meeting entries which is 11 a.m. To 4 p.m. Is when you can book and then 11 the night to 2 a.m.

33:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
That should be very clear there when you can book with me.

33:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean I didn't respond to him just because like he doesn't need like that is a worry but I'm just gonna tell him, oh, those are the call times. Like for you. I don't know. But it's just like, because we do have enough overlap. Chinmain has nine, have at least like a couple of hours a day.

34:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just show him a screenshot of like your calendar with all the pair of homecomings and meetings between us and say, we meet. We meet each other. So it's just, um, Yeah.

34:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So when do you think you're, let us, I don't want to force you into a final decision now, but when do you think you would have an answer by?

34:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, I don't think I heard this properly. You asked me when signup is ready, right? Or when am I able to be full-time in Startino?

34:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
The latter. Okay. Yeah.

34:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll probably provide you with a definite answer on Tuesday.

35:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Tuesday. Okay.

35:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then Tuesday, you'll let us know. And then from there, if you are going full-time, when could we expect that?

35:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So in typical Filipino companies, resignation happens on a 30-day basis. So you have to render 30 days of service.

35:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
However, I can negotiate.

35:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll probably try to negotiate it to be shorter because that's also possible to be done.

35:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool. Sounds good.

35:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, keep us updated.

35:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sure thing.

35:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right, cool.

35:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Great chat, guys. Jonas, good luck coding, and I'll be back on in like 20 minutes. I'll let you know if you're going for lunch then. I mean, yeah, we'll... Have a nice day, guys.

35:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye-bye. See you.

35:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye-bye.

35:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
At least on his phone.

35:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, on his phone.

36:00 - Jonas Lindberg

Mon, Aug 5, 2024

1:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
How are you doing?

1:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, very well. Thank you very well.

1:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, nice.

1:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so this is kind of like more free meeting. I want to to go over the workshop that I've planned, the mission and vision statement workshop. And also just want to get your feedback on my kind of setup, on how I've set up the workshop, maybe since you're like in marketing and all of that. And it's like a vision and mission statement that's pretty close to marketing. So I think you could probably have some valuable insights for me too, but outside of the typical client-project manager relationship. Sure, sure.

2:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
So let me just share the link with you to the Figma. So I'm hoping to run the workshop kind of through a Figma that we've kind of pre-assigned a bit. In it I've held up a few things like the purpose, our roles and responsibilities, some things that we need to fill out like the key stakeholders that should be present in the meeting and kind of the outline of the meeting.

3:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you able to access the link I sent you?

3:16 - Jonathan Phillips 
Why did that come through?

3:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
I sent it in the chat there.

3:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think your mic might have changed to one that was worse. Your audio was good, and then it suddenly turned a bit more like robots-ish.

3:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
Not coming through very well, is it?

3:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, it wasn't good earlier. I'm figuring that the microphone changed when you put in the earbuds.

3:52 - Jonathan Phillips 
And you can't hear very well now.

3:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
I can hear you.

3:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
I can understand you. But it was better earlier.

3:58 - Jonathan Phillips 
Let me try. Is that any better?

4:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, the audio is better now.

4:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
OK. I can't hear you now, but I know you can hear me. That's good.

4:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
Oh, you can't hear me?

4:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, it's just easier with headphones. But I'll manage. Don't worry. I've got the link up now.

4:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, nice.

4:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
So there's two pages. One's the planning the workshop, which is more the one I wanted to go through with you. And then the actual D-workshop, which I'm still building a bit out. Yeah, I want to basically go through the stages outlined in planning the workshop there. Yes, sure. So yeah, just to to go through this. The purpose of the workshop is aligning on a mission statement and a vision statement. The reason I use aligning there more so than creating or defining is because all the key stakeholders that have a part in the project should be aligned and agree on division and division specialist. The mission is more so how you got the idea in the first place, the reason why you thought of this project at the core, while the vision is where you want to get to, where you imagine the project being in the future. Then once we have those two key parts down, the mission, where we start from, and the vision, where you want to end up, we can start much better building a roadmap and filling out the in-between. To a point where the development should hopefully be a lot more holistic. Everyone should know where we are in the project, what parts they are taking part in, instead of just following tasks that get listed down or handed to them in the backlog. Sure. Makes sense.

5:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
So for our roles in this meeting, I will not be leading the meeting. It will be you, the product owner, that is going to lead this meeting because this meeting is to your benefit for you to help everyone align on a project vision that you can guard and make sure all the features align with moving forward. It should also help benefit us when planning out features and such because then we'll be working from a standpoint where everyone knows the vision in the future so we can better prioritize what is essential compared to what's like just nice to have or things that can be added on later. Sure, sure.

6:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, it makes all sense.

6:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we can probably just start with the key stakeholders. So these are the people that should be present during the meeting, everyone that has a stake in IntelliAgent. So of course, JP, you're a part of it. Then, yeah, if you could help me just, is there anyone I don't know about that has equity or investment or anything in the IntelliAgent?

7:06 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, no, the only other person obviously is Coen who's heavily involved. So I think involving Coen, he has a number of skills that I think complement what we're trying to achieve. So I'm more than happy for Coen to be involved. Not obviously all the time, but I think any key decisions, especially with him going through the ADAPT process, which you've already started and you've learned a lot already. I think that's quite valuable because then we're not going over the same ground.

7:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, absolutely.

7:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so outside of us developers and us in Startino, just you and Koen Da? I think so.

7:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK. Yeah.

7:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you can take a little moment to read through the purpose I've written here if you want to. Yeah.

8:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, it all makes sense. Yeah.

8:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
So then there's the outline here. The reason I filled it up here is, of course, because you'll be the one running the meeting. So you'll have to know where it's supposed to go, how we're supposed to go through it. So in the beginning, of course, introduce what the meeting is about, basically going through what purpose of this. And clarifying that it's a collaborative session, you're not going to just be telling everyone what the vision is. It should be a collaborative session where at one point everyone will fill in what's their idea of the vision is and we'll compare afterwards, combine it into a final mission. A vision statement, then in the end, move on to a document that's using a proper, I don't remember the name of it. I'm going to add it in, but it's a vision statement document that has a lot of items we can fill in and make sure everything's aligned.

9:04 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, it makes perfect sense.

9:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

9:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, you can see our product owner will invite everyone to write a statement around their motivation. Yeah, also the motivation to work on the product, compare and compile into a final vision statement.

9:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
One thing that will happen before here is you'll describe your mission statement.

9:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
So this will basically just be telling your story of how you conceive the idea of intelligence to give everyone the perspective of like where fundamentally this platform, this product is coming from So it could be like saying like, so I was sitting in my office looking out the window and I saw a plane, which made, yeah. Just how you came to think of the product because that's- It's helpful. I fully understand.

10:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
So hoping we can run this. I want to get on the ground running, get the meeting done as soon as possible and everything. So I'm just finishing up the workshop tab. You can see I have just quick context right now, which is outlining a bit the purpose, what the mission statement is. I don't think, yeah. Can you see the pages top left and then click on the workshop?

10:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep, I'm in now. Yeah.

10:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so this will be the one that we will be showing everyone when you're running the workshop. Outline some quick context what the two different things are.

10:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
how it'll, yeah, we will be defining where we're starting from and where we want to get and how it'll like help fill in everything between like kind of what I've filled you in on right now. Sure. Then moving on to the idea of the project, this will be you describing the mission statement, how you like came up with the idea of it, what problem you saw with the industry. Then hopefully everyone will create their own sticky notes describing their interpretation of your idea.

11:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Next up, I haven't created this slide yet, but it'll be the vision. So you'll explain your vision of the platform Intelligent. Then in a quite similar vein, everyone will fill in their motivation for working on the project, what they imagine it to be, what excites them about it. Then after that, we'll all collaborate. Of course, you'll be owning it, you'll be reading it, and combining it into a final proper vision statement that will then move on to documents using the little pre-made documents that I haven't added yet.

12:06 - Jonathan Phillips 
Now that makes sense. It gives us a good foundation for understanding at the same level, which I think is important. We all think that we see the same thing as each other, which we don't. Yeah, exactly. It's nice to at least have a vision and an understanding of what everyone else is seeing. So that's cool. It's cool.

12:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I'm glad to hear you like it. Do you have any feedback or anything? Because this is very in the vein of what you're doing professionally, right?

12:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, what I'm very wary of is me wading in now and saying, do it like this. How about this? That's not the way it's going to work because it basically devalues what you've done because I think it's a really great start. So what I'll do at the moment is I will go away, have a little think, read the structure again, look at what you're doing, and I will give some feedback. And then we can either incorporate that in the workshop or it can be incorporated after the workshop for the next time it's done. So what I think is Maybe an optimum way forward, but I certainly don't want to diminish what you've done because it's excellent So no no absolutely not like you're working in this industry for so much longer than I have

13:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
like This is just what I've diagrammed throughout yesterday night and today up until now like I'd love your feedback on it But the most important thing, irrespective of the detail, is that you're thinking this way.

13:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
And this is the way to start any project off. It's the way to align ideas. It's the way to make sure everyone's moving in the same direction. And that is key. So how we do that, that's semantics. That's something we can discuss. But the key thing at the moment is that we are starting this the right way. So that's cool. Nice. Thank you for that.

14:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that's, that's really all I want to bring up in this meeting. It's why I wanted it to be more one on one because it's like mostly just between you and me as I'll be the project manager and you'll be the project owner and didn't want to waste like, like mentioned that

14:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
we have six guys in this meeting it's like multiplying each hour by I didn't realize that this was what we're going to discuss so this is perfect we've done it which is fantastic and I'm glad we've done it and it can only go from strength to strength now because it's all about everybody having the same outlook. So what we've had I think so far and I think what you suffered with with Kuhn and Adapt at the beginning was everybody had different thoughts about what they were trying to do. And it's not easy. We've got so many different conflicting things. Everybody's different to start with. We've got different levels of knowledge. We've got different cultures. We've got different languages. It's not easy. It really isn't easy. So I think this is a great idea to actually align and it can only get better. So that's really cool. Yeah, fantastic.

15:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Then, yeah, just to give you an overview of like how I'm planning to move forward with Intelligent after the this workshop, of course, starting with the mission vision workshop, the one we're running currently, the mission is less participative, because it's just how you came up with their idea but of course we're going to get everyone's interpretation of that and discuss on that afterwards and the vision. After this workshop I want to move on to creating like a roadmap workshop where we define the high-level roadmap of where you want the projects to end up. So basically, if the mission is the where we're at currently, or how what made you want to create this and the vision is where you want to end up the roadmap should fill in the in between so that we can start like building upon it, get a good foundation, not start with the windows.

16:04 - Jonathan Phillips 
Absolutely, no it all makes sense, it all makes sense. A lot of the success of a project isn't necessarily going away and creating something, it's making sure the team work together because that is absolutely essential and everybody understands what they're doing and if people are going away doing different things and coming back together and going this doesn't align that's where you start to waste time and become becomes more difficult but I think we're on the right road here now and I think you've you've now grasped as a group of really young intelligent developers that there's a lot of structure behind how to move through a project and it's a massive learning learning curve for everybody. So when you start to do this in life, you think, wow, there's so much I need to learn. And most of it is quite simple and obvious, but it's only simple and obvious when you know it. When you don't know it, it doesn't exist in your head. So I think as a group of developers, I think this will be a great foundation for every project you now move forward with.

17:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, absolutely.

17:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's what I'm hoping.

17:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Excellent.

17:10 - Jonathan Phillips 
Okay, so I will go away, I'll have a quick read, I'll look over, I'll feedback, and we can take it from there. Yeah, awesome.

17:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I hope we'll see each other tomorrow then. Yes. Let's get this running quickly.

17:25 - Jonathan Phillips 
Perfect, perfect, excellent. All right, thanks for your time Jonas. Much appreciated. Yeah, thanks. I'll see you.

17:30 - Jonas Lindberg

Mon, Jul 29, 2024

1:51 - Jonathan Phillips 
you Good morning, afternoon, or evening. Hello.

2:06 - Jonathan Phillips 
Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you.

2:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Now I should hear you.

2:17 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to keep my camera off because the bandwidth ain't the best where I am right now.

2:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Great to see you.

2:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm doing great. How about you? Yeah, very good.

2:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Very good.

2:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice. Great. So how have things been with making that new UVP document coming along?

2:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I've not finished it yet. I didn't do anything over the weekend with it. So I've still got a little bit to do. But hopefully, I will have it today, hopefully. What I want to do is make it detailed and specific enough so we wouldn't be going backwards and forwards too many times, rather than give you a brief overview and then try and build it. I thought if I can build it first and then you can try and take it apart, it might be a bit quicker.

3:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

3:14 - Jorge Lewis 
One thing that is super useful for us, and Jonas has mentioned this to you guys previously, is just examples do us tons of good because Like, like that's how humans learn naturally. Right. So giving us a couple of examples of how these things look in person, not only we can learn, but also there might be a chance for us to create some, uh, to train these, I mean, to train the actual agents on it. Um, one of the, one of the trickiest part that I can foresee this, um, the whole system being is, well, the whole thing in essence is trying to put you in this and the system. The hardest part of that is having what you guys did with Jonas, where you guys were kind of drilling questions and saying, really, really trying to get behind why he's doing what he's doing right now. That is hard to get into an LLM. To have it reflect and have it really ask deep questions, trying to guide the user is something that's be quite hard. There's been a lot of research papers published on exactly this, like reflection and planning for LLMs, so hopefully those work out for us.

4:20 - Jonathan Phillips 
So from my perspective, I'm very different to Koen, so my philosophies and the way I work, we're very different. Obviously we get on very well, we're colleagues, we get on well, but my perspective is different. So I'm not as say not as worried is maybe not the right term, but I've already replicated LLMs doing what I want. So I'm relatively relaxed in that there is technology there, not exactly what we want, the technology is already there to let them do it, so to speak. It might not be accurate, it might not be as clean but it exists so in my mind it's not going to be difficult to do it it's going to be tricky to train it so I think the training is the hard thing because ultimately we will get a response from the agent every single time that's not an issue but is it the response we want and is it leading to the outcome that we want so I I am not as worried about um detail at the moment I'm more worried about the word is not the right term I'll stop using that I'm more sort of like excited because that's probably a better term about putting putting the framework together and then working hard to train it and get it right so that that's my perspective um in in marketing it's very much I'll use the term common sense. Marketing is common sense. You need a framework, you need a model, a system, but it's common sense. And a lot of it is communication. So it is exactly what we're trying to do, a conversation between the AI and the human. And it's just a case of having a conversation and getting an outcome. It's really not rocket science, this.

6:14 - Jonathan Phillips 
There's also, in a lot of cases, no right answer, which is really good for us because there won't be a user at the end. It's not a mathematical equation. The user's saying, hang on a minute, you've got it wrong. So there will be instances where they say, this doesn't feel right, or I don't think this is the best answer, but there's no right or wrong answer, which is really good, which is a great starting place.

6:35 - Jorge Lewis 
That's one of the things with AI actually, like for example, Tesla, they will never, like they need 99.99999 for their systems to be considered correct. For us, it's like a much, much more gray area.

6:50 - Jonathan Phillips 
Absolutely absolutely and that's what's great about marketing marketing is a lot of the time opinions rather than more facts so if we if we put a table in and it starts to spew figures out there incorrect that's a different issue but ultimately if somebody says this is my business this is what I want to do and the AI says well this is the best approach it's like hey you know it could be it might not be But what we're trying to do, what I'm trying to do is very much give them something they don't have initially. So the good thing again is that my target market are those people who don't really know what they're doing. So even if we give them a little something, it's better than nothing. Um, so I'm not saying that's good enough and I'm not saying that is the goal, but we are starting at quite a low level. Yeah. So I'm not, as far as the responses go and as far as conversations go, like I say, I've mimicked it already and had some really good outcomes and when I say mimicked it, I've even asked various engines to simulate it themselves or I've got the three main engines and had conversations with each other and one pretending they're human and just to see what they would do pretending they're human. So I've tried a lot of scenarios and most of the time the answer is sufficient, in fact it's more than sufficient, it's actually quite good. So what I'll do is, going back to the initial request, I will put in quite a few examples just to give you a flavour and again the baseline is quite low so we are talking potentially to bakers, we're talking to landscape gardeners, people do cleaning services, these are people who never sit at laptops, they don't understand computers much so if we could have them talk to their smartphone and just have a conversation and get some output. Initially, that is incredible. And obviously we want something a little more credible with the document, et cetera, at the end. But ultimately we're saying to them, Hey, if you take your business in this direction, you're going to have a lot more opportunity than you would by just sitting at your desk at home, not knowing what to do. Yeah.

9:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Makes perfect sense. Um, I re-read that document you sent, I think, probably a few weeks ago now, related to the market size. It looked quite promising. And just to double-check things, you're targeting non-tech-savvy people that don't have any marketing in place, relatively small, zero to 50 employees, roughly, that want to get their marketing somewhere.

9:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Absolutely.

9:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
So that's my target market, which is an incredible hard market to get to. Because like I say, these people aren't originally.

9:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, exactly.

9:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
So I've got a few methods, channels to do that, especially getting to organizations that they talk to banks, you know, all that sort of stuff, real world stuff. But I don't think most of these will be the likes on LinkedIn and Instagram looking at the latest How you can 10x this and how you can do this, which is all gibberish. Anyway, none of it works.

10:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Absolutely My feed on LinkedIn like for I think it was like a full month. It was just the most absolute garbage like lead gen sales marketing and I and it was just I'm not an expert you definitely are I'm not but I do know I I guess you could say common sense. And what they were saying was GPT spitted stuff formatted in a way that they would say it. And it was just so repetitive. Thankfully, nowadays, I've replaced it with some AI stuff.

10:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
So yes, sadly, a lot of people out there who believe it, and it's It is, unfortunately, it's an opportunity for people who aren't necessarily good at their subject matter, but they are great salespeople. So what they managed to do is sell anything they could, they could. Exactly in the short term because there's no longevity so they pop in on a I've got a course or I've got a system and they'll make a shed load of money in the days weeks after that and then they realize that people find them out and then they'll change into something else morph into a different being and start to sell something else and that's what that's what social media is full of but anyway my target market isn't necessarily the people looking at those however that said I want it to be so easy to use and so effective that anybody can dip in. It doesn't matter what level you're at, you will benefit from it because even I, I'm learning all the time. I'm learning every day. I love reading. I absolutely love listening to people who have great minds, brilliant thinkers. So no matter how experienced you are and how many years you've been doing something, there's always opportunity to learn. So even the people who are, I would say, relatively experienced will be able to benefit because I'll be putting things into the framework that are quite up-to-date and modern thinking, and maybe stuff they already know, but they forgot. And we do it all the time. We read stuff, we look at the way of doing things, and then we forget, and then we see it again and think, why have I not been doing this? I know it already. So there's lots of reasons why people might dip into it and use it, even if they are quite experienced. So I'm not going to rule anybody out. It's quite a large market. However, marketing-wise, we've got to focus a message into a specific target niche to start with. We can't spray for everybody.

12:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Out of curiosity, would door-to-door work for this? Like going in person to these small stores?

12:35 - Jonathan Phillips 
Door-to-door might work except that it's frowned upon a little bit now because again the noise is there. You've got people being hammered all the time on their screens, in person, on the telephones. It's just constant noise. So the way that marketing works now, or the way that modern marketing thinkers position it, is that you don't go and sell your product. What you do is you build a brand, you build a framework, you build a business that people come to you when they need you.

13:10 - Jonathan Phillips 
And then what you do is you put out content and signposts and all bits and pieces out there so that if somebody wants what you offer, they will find you. And although that's scary to a lot of people, and the reason it's scary to a lot of people is because they don't really have a proposition. And people won't come to them, and they won't do any business. So they fear that their proposition isn't good enough and not required. Therefore, they can't just put it out there and let people come to them. And yes, there is a little bit of awareness and making people aware and maybe interrupting them a little bit. But the interruption people don't want anymore. They know if they've got a problem, they will go and try and find a solution. So the best businesses are the solution. This is why people won't have longevity on social media, shouting about all their great services, because really it's not a solution to the problems.

14:12 - Jonathan Phillips 
We are talking long term though so when I say long term I don't mean forever but you can't start a business and start to create revenues instantly unless of course you have something that people are demanding and almost knocking on your door or you're going to a festival and selling beer. You're not going to be able to get that instant sort of revenue stream. So you've got to put the foundations down. You've got to create the brand, which isn't just logos and typeface. It's all about a feel and how people interact with you and the way they feel when they take your services. So it's building that brand and it's also putting yourself in places that when they realize they have a problem that you're front and central. Whether it's a Google search, whether it's a referral from a friend when they have a conversation and say I've got a problem, you've got to be there front and center and that's the hard graft you've got to do over the years in order for your business to be making a nice revenue, growing really nicely, acquiring new customers, but not necessarily throwing out advertising left, right and center, which is quite expensive and the return advertising isn't very good.

15:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, thank you so much for all of that actually. It's we we've been what since I've been kind of out of sync in terms of time zone with everybody. I've been able to kind of deep dive into content marketing, and it's something that we're going to be kind of going into because, number one, it's a great avenue to to learn, we'll get to learn. We're going to be making content based on like technical videos, non-technical videos, so that people trying to build products like you guys, we're able to share our experience through platforms like there and kind of just offer value and put our brand out there.

15:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
Exactly, exactly, that's the right way of doing it. So the content is the way to go obviously digitally. You've got to provide content whether it's podcast infographics, thought leadership pieces and that's what I'm going to be doing with the whole story framework soon. I've I've just built a website. I'm going to get a newsletter out. And then hopefully, my goal will be to have tens of thousands of followers by the time we get to the point of delivering any technology. So you've got a captive audience already. So that's the plan. Whether it works or not, that's in the lap of the gods at the moment.

16:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
But I'm going to try very hard to get there. Yeah. Cool.

16:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, that's great. So I want to go into, just briefly, I don't want to make this too long, just putting me back into place onto this project. I've been watching all the meetings that you guys have had. I've watched the long one with all six of you guys. But I guess, let me explain how I see IntelliAgent, at least the first step and then also the subsequent steps. And then you can correct me wherever I'm wrong or wherever I'm missing something. Sure. First phase, we're going to build one workshop that's going to have an output of the unique value purpose of a specific of the user and their company. And to accomplish that, we're going to have a team of AI agents collaborating and trying to extract all the necessary pieces of information. So for example, we're gonna have the facilitator bot, which his main job is to kind of facilitate through the different phases, which you're going to deploy. And it was in on on the document, then there, there might then I think there will be a like, for example, an analyst agent that might search the some sort of search the web, in short, for companies that might have similar value propositions or competitive research, those things. There might be another agent that is focused on branding that the brand expert, the what do you call the you call the brand agents a name?

18:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't know. But yes, specifically what you said so far is perfect. Absolutely. Bang on. Yeah.

18:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So the brand agent that just kind of aligns with the brand. Okay. And then they come to the UVP and that's the end goal. There's also the right side of the screen, which is going to be kind of a persistent screen to keep the user to allow for a better UX, to keep, the left side will be a chat interface where the user will be chatting with the agents, and the right side will be a way to present the, now I'm guessing it's going to be the UVP, as well as, what else is on the right side?

18:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
So yes, so if we look at this specific workshop, the UVP's kind of made up into, let's just say three areas. Firstly, the category you're playing in, so are you a software company, do you make garden tools, maybe specific garden tools, maybe you're a rake manufacturer, or maybe you do left-handed rakes, if you're going to be really specific. So the category you play in, then your unique offering, which is hopefully different to even the closest competitor, otherwise what are you doing it for? And then the last section is whom. So your target market, your audience, your niche that you're playing in. So you've got a category which is kind of high-level software company, but your niche might be coders that don't use keyboards and only voice input. For example, that might be your target audience. Might be a bit weird, but there's a group of people out there. And the thing about marketing is that if you are very good in a small niche, you're probably more profitable than you will be spraying to the whole world and trying to sell to everybody. So sometimes you think by reducing your niche to a small, succinct segment, of people you're doing yourself a disservice but quite often it's the way to go because if people recognize you in that niche as the number one player the most authoritative the most important you get all their business so anyway so that's the idea you're trying to hone everything down so the uvp is basically saying we play in this market we have this differentiator, this is why we're different, this is why you come to us and not the competition and these are the target market, these are the people and that's it. So that's all we're trying to get, this statement with those three elements in and then I'll detail the way the thinking around how we get to those three elements.

20:48 - Jonathan Phillips 
The output on the right side, my thinking at the moment is a bit like the interface to Claude. I think Claude is one of the best visual representations of what we could have at the moment. So ultimately, if you're talking about the category, then it'll create an artifact as Claude calls it or a document, a statement on the category, and then it will go on to the middle bit, the offering, and then it will go on to the target market. So it then gives you those elements that you can then go back and play with. You can modify one of them, and then it potentially modifies your conversation. And then you end up with an output maybe at the bottom, which is a combined document, and that's it. Simple as that.

21:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry, Jonas, go ahead.

21:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, on that note, one of the things that I was most confused about, this was back when it was brand purpose, but I think it's still like remaining there, that question is when should the user transition from looking at the chat and chatting with the bots to looking at the cards or cards or like the choices on the right and using the UI? Underwrite to like pick their favorites because before it was like you talk with the bots until the copywriter was able to like figure figure you out more and give you like two examples and then you chose the one you resonated more with whether that is your dream makers or you bring technology to non-tech people or yeah I don't remember exactly the choices that were brought up then, but you kind of choose between them. How would the user know that they're supposed to be switching over to the right and working on the left side?

22:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
So that was, I think that was Kuhn's idea, wasn't it? Have a choice.

22:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm quite easy with that. I don't necessarily need that as such. If it's something easy to do, then I'm happy because it provides an extra level of clarity. But I think most of the conversations can be held in the one interface.

22:52 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't think there should be confusion where people look. I think it should be on the right side is output, on the left side is conversation. And if you're doing it from a smartphone, then you don't really have that. On a desktop, yes, you have all the elements you can play around with. And that's a mistake we make when we build websites. We think everyone's looking from a desktop and it looks beautiful. Go on your phone and everything's clogged together. You can't really differentiate between sectors of your display. You very much have a very simple interface. So I'm all about simple.

23:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep. I think great, great question, Jonas. I think JP, you covered up every topic, really staying minimal for this first iteration is what we need. And then also the UX wouldn't be that intuitive. We don't want the user questioning what we should be looking at. Um, but I think I love the idea of, of the split testing me. I'm just in love with general split testing. I just think it's a great way to gather data later down the road for sure.

23:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can have it as like a, like a mini workshop within a workshop to kind of I was thinking maybe one of the agents could have a tool to trigger it, where the agent, basically their message would be, OK, I have some cards for you. And then underneath the message, you can pick between the two cards or something. So it's in the chat. It's in the play instead of on a separate panel.

24:12 - Jonathan Phillips 
Absolutely fine. It should be in the thread. It should be continuous. They should know where they're looking. And it's one place. And that's simple.

24:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, great.

24:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, we just need to see it.

24:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so on the right side, we need to kind of figure out, I think we'll have it set in stone after you send us what exactly the UVP looks like, kind of what artifacts we can put on there.

24:38 - Jorge Lewis 
One thing I have, by the way, and I think I want to try it out with you if you're open to it. So what I believe from my experience doing all of these things, I think that examples, like we've been saying, are a great way to help us understand this. But I want to go a step further and have you create kind of as in-depth tree of examples as possible. So you start from one of the first user messages saying, or the agent's message saying, let's start this workshop. And then you kind of go down the different routes, letting your brain just really go for it. Okay, the bot might say this, or it might say this, it might say this. And just keep going down those branches. It'll take time. It might feel tedious after you're getting down to the last few messages. I'm not saying it has to be entirely complete, but giving, just letting your brain go free really gives us as well a way of what's intuitive to you, gives us what comes to your head first when you're having those conversations. So if you're open to that, I'd like you to kind of try that out and see how that works. Absolutely.

25:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
Not a problem at all. I mean, that's actually quite quick and easy to do. So it's not an imposition. So I will endeavor to give you the framework. Then I will give you as many examples as in a fictional examples of this is the type of thing we want to be doing. And then I'll try and give you some real life conversations as well. Exactly, that was perfect.

26:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So just to make sure that the examples, ideally, the structure is kind of like a tree. So at the top, we have that one message, right? And then they kind of branch out into the possibilities. For one tree, just having one user profile of whatever, you can define it whatever you want it to be. Okay, perfect. Um, so yeah, kind of to outline the plan moving forward, I think. Well, tomorrow you'll be, or it's actually your morning right now, right? Uh, yeah, it's nine, nine 15.

26:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. Yeah. So, okay.

26:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So you'll have it to us hopefully by the end of today, you said, right? Hopefully, hopefully.

26:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

26:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
Maybe not the whole thing with examples at the moment, but I'll certainly have the initial sort of, um, piece for you. Yeah. Go ahead, Jonas.

26:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I was just gonna mention that I think it would be probably really valuable just if you run I don't know how it's done with like Companies like mine Jorge works to co-founders, but run through with one or both of us just through the entire UDP Workshop and have that's like a properly as a prepared, planned, proper workshop, more so than ad hoc one in the middle of another meeting, that we can continuously go and look back on as a source of a very good example, basically.

27:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

27:32 - Jonathan Phillips 
As far as I'm concerned, the closer you guys are to what we're trying to achieve the better because you can then use your intelligence and your brilliance and interpret what we're doing better. So what I don't want to do and what I've never liked to do with any development team I've worked with is tell them what to do because It's not my job to tell you what to do. You're the experts. But if you don't have that connection, then you end up listening to what I'm doing because you don't have any other options. So if I can get closer to you and let you know what exactly what's in my head, then I think that works much better.

28:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And then on our part for that to work though, we need to keep you in sync and that involves just keeping you updated a lot. So we need to make sure we keep doing that and do that properly.

28:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think the more comfortable you are, the more communication we will have because you will feel that you are adding value and it's a natural conversation rather than asking a question because you think you should know the answer already and you're worried that you're looking because you don't know what to say or how to ask the next question. So as far as I'm concerned, any question you have, just fire away. Just absolutely bomb me with loads and loads of questions. I'm more than happy to answer all of them because it helps us both.

28:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's actually a point that I realized. Do you use Obsidian, by the way, by rare chance?

28:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Use what, sorry? Obsidian.

29:01 - Jonathan Phillips 
It sounds really nice, but I don't think so, no.

29:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

29:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Take a look at it. I don't know if it's made for you, but we personally love it. It's just like a really simple note-taking app. But anyways, I put down a note in there to include in part of our interviews, which is to really drill down on if our team members can ask questions. They don't have to be great questions, but asking frequent questions is super important because the deadliest thing to development from taking development from a client is assumptions. We assume we understand this, we assume we understand this, and that's just where things go downhill. Exactly. Exactly that.

29:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
So having a whiteboard platform in order to just put questions down without any sort of immediate response required as such, or any pressure, or messing up people's messaging systems. Great.

29:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
No problem at all. Absolutely no problem. Perfect.

29:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks JP for your time. Kind of a good coincidence that Coen's Wi-Fi went out.

30:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
Serendipity, that's what it's all about.

30:11 - Jorge Lewis 
We'll catch up with him another time. Yeah, so thanks so much. Great clearing things up.

30:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
One thing I want to note on before we end this meeting, we've, after all of Kuhn's feedback and everything, we've adopted FigJam as kind of our whiteboard application as part of Figma. So we're working on diagrams and getting things we set up visually there so that in future meetings, we can hopefully be a bit more visual when we're planning and have things more on paper by the end of the meeting. Excellent.

30:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, no, it seems to be coming along. You know, it takes time because if you're not used to doing something, you've got to build the whole structure of what you, what you do and what you're comfortable with. But you know, we're all learning all the time. It's never, it's never a problem to learn and do new things.

30:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, and just that reminded me as well, I should be mentioning the plan. On top of what Jonas said, yeah, we're having, so how we're going to try to do things is having one visual representation of the project, which is on the FigJam, and then one technical representation of the project, which is through a backlog on our project management software, plane.so. And the one on the plane.so is the list of backlog tasks, that one is more formal, You don't necessarily have to understand it on a, like a very technical level, but it's just more of, okay, progress is getting done. Things are getting happening. Things are being done. And then the visual representation is the one that we, everyone understands in and out. So the plan moving, with that said, the plan moving for this week, at least, is since it's going to be your end of day today, that's going to be, we're already going, our team's already going to be asleep. So we're probably going to get started tomorrow, take in that, try to craft up the visual representation, make sure all things are finalized, get the backlog set up. Hopefully Tuesday and Wednesday, all that should be done. We can get any back and forth limbo done. And then I think by Thursday, we could start working on things. Jonas, how does that sound? Of course not a set in stone, but on a grand scope of things.

32:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
From how you're setting up? Yeah, that sounds good to me, but I haven't looked.

32:14 - Jorge Lewis 
The thing that would push us back is any kind of delay between questions and answers. So to prevent that, let's, instead of asking, if you, if, if I'm going to make sure we don't ask any questions in the chat, instead, I'm going to say, I'm going to ask the team members to ask you if you have time for a call, because as we know, that's the most efficient way to get things done.

32:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
So also just like maybe voice messages, I think voice messages are probably very efficient for like simple questions. Yeah.

32:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, voice call first, then voice messages, then text if on a bill. Yeah. Cool. All right, JP. Um, so yeah, hopefully that fun sounds good to you. Perfect.

32:58 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, no problem at all. But like I say, just, just bombard me with questions. Don't feel like you can't just any, even stupid questions, whatever you want to ask, just, just go far away. Will do.

33:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, also on all the paperwork, by the way, we have to get that because I believe we signed the the contract for kind of the previous spec that we worked on. So we're gonna, we can kind of avoid all that. We can override it with a new contract and make sure everything's up to date. Yeah, sure. No worries.

33:27 - Jonathan Phillips 
All right. Thanks JP.

33:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
Have a good evening.

33:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
See you later. Have a good day. Bye bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (15).txt"

Mon, Jul 29, 2024

0:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
for you on DM and Discord.

0:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
How attacked am I going to be during this meeting?

0:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
We might want to formalize that the previous agreement is canceled, like the previous estimation. Can you hear me.

1:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you hear what I said.

1:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
We might want to formalize that the previous design spec is canceled, like that it's terminated the contract.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I can bring it up and just say, how should we move forward with the paperwork?

1:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Do you have, like, admin capabilities in this meeting? Because it's, like, under company, which you're, like, an admin of

2:17 - Jorge Lewis 
My personal email, so I don't know.

2:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
You should start using your company email.

2:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
I recommend just on Brave or whatever, create a profile, a browser profile for work where you're just logged in on all the work accounts, no personal accounts. Because Google is kind of annoying where it's like, there's like a default user, the user zero, which it just goes into no matter what, if you click links and stuff. And you can't change what user that is without logging completely out and then again, I mean, Yeah, I'm using my personal one because I need to start transitioning.

3:13 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, JP should be joining in a second.

3:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let me get on my lo-fi beats to relax.

3:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Has really helped me with current meetings.

3:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you send a link to Kurt? Your camera's frozen for me, by the way.

4:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Your audio also seems to be incredibly delayed.

4:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, how's it going, Cuan?

4:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, guys.

4:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just waiting on Jorge to join back in. I think he had some camera issues or mic issue.

4:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. I can't see anything on my screen. My Wi-Fi is really low, so.

4:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

4:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
You guys are just joining in now. So yeah, I got to kill my camera just because of bandwidth.

4:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

5:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Should I turn mine off too?

5:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, maybe I don't know. Let's see. See if it works.

5:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

5:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, guys.

5:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

5:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, man. Sorry, I'm just keeping my camera off because bandwidth here is a bit rubbish.

5:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I'm going to have to do that in a second as well. Where are you at right now?

5:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm in the north of Spain where my family's home, my wife's family home.

5:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, nice. Is your Spanish? Yeah. Hablas espanol?

5:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
A little bit, not much. I get to have a holiday. Come on. I don't need to speak so I can just not, I disengage my brain while I'm here, which is nice. I don't have to do anything.

6:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think turn the camera off. I think that's a better idea than...

6:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cool.

6:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Virg, your bandwidth seems to be suffering.

6:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, what was that?

6:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Your bandwidth seems to be suffering right now.

6:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

6:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

6:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is it, like, audible, though?

6:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's audible. There seems to be a huge delay and you're kind of cutting in and out, but it might be fine now with the cameras off.

6:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, let's try it out. Um, cool. So, so yeah, it's been around like three weeks since we've last chatted, I think doing right.

7:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool.

7:05 - Jorge Lewis 
So kind of, yeah. Well, what is there, what can we go over? What is there anything top of mind?

7:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, Yeah, obviously we did. Jonas has been doing a lot of planning, but I'm not sure what the plans are. The status updates are very sporadic in terms of them actually happening versus the usefulness to an end user like me, as opposed to technical updates. So there's definitely some work to be done there. I think you guys are starting IntelliAgent in Angular today as well.

7:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just wanted to see how do we make sure that we've got consistency in communication and we've got clarity in terms of what's going on. I'm a little bit lost on, I mean, obviously we're more than a few weeks into the project now and I'm not really clear on where we are. I mean, we had that first big release and we've not really had anything since.

8:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not trying to suggest that there's no work going on. I know there is, but it's just, it's not tangible to me.

8:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Um, okay. So, so pretty much since our last, the last time we chatted was roughly the same time that we had that, that release where you guys were able to kind of play around with it since then, from what I've gathered, gathered is that the, the, the vision has changed quite a lot. All right.

8:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Not really.

8:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I mean, I don't think I can agree on that. It's just things have changed so much in terms of what you're trying to make the product like, for example, the focus before was making the user check in having the the coaching session, having the coach coach on things before we We introduced the entire new concept of mentor, separating the personas, introducing coaching workshops, and now we're more so focusing on the entire onboarding session, onboarding workshop, whereas before that was not a thing at all. So I would say that things have changed quite a bit.

9:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's take those things one at a time. So coaching was always there, as you just said. Wrapping it around a workshop doesn't really change the fact that there is coaching going Yes, there is a split between the mentor and the coach. You know, the guy's already gone down the path of having an eugenic system. So that's, yeah, I think there is a difference between a mentor and a coach just for the user experience point of view.

9:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
The onboarding was, if you look at the original mural, it is there, the onboarding piece.

10:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
But, I mean, we can rake over the coals on this, you know, and myself and Jonas spoke about this a little bit, and yes, there's definitely a delta from what we originally agreed. I don't think of it as big as certainly your words were just alluding to. But what I don't understand is what's the so what of all of that?

10:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
you know, regardless of what I think or what you think, there is a difference, whatever words you want to use, but I'm not I've no one's told me what the consequences of that are. Like, is it now another day? Is it another hour? Is it another seven years? Like, there's no there's no, there's no update on consequences of this and what we're doing. So I'm completely lost in terms of where we are on the project and what's next.

10:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we're trying to get a really a whole bird's eye view of the project now, because at least on our side, whether it was clear in your head, I'm not sure. But on our side, there's a lot of new things that we're introducing on and now kind of focusing on before we knew there was onboarding. The onboarding for us before was, okay, we're going to gather the user's data. That was, we're going to, we're going to gather their why, why are they doing this? We didn't understand that it was a full. Really 60 minute workshop potentially longer less than it is a really now it's a really deep workshop that we've gone into details of which weren't discussed before. There's all these little things that I just go to us so right now we're you could say prior to all this planning that we had so let's say three weeks ago we had our last call. We were still, we were very clear on how we wanted to move things forward. But as we introduced things and went further into things and how you, the mentoring thing was, like you said, there is some similarities, but in terms of actual tech work, there is more work to be done. But the biggest thing is introducing the understanding your why workshop and having the whole onboarding session was new to us. So we're trying to figure out, we're trying to put our foot down and figure out how is the project looking on our side?

11:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you're saying a lot of things here. That's not necessarily useful to throw so many things, topics without talking about any one of them. So the why workshop should be exactly the same scope as what's IntelliAgent. So yes, I get that that's new, but we want to be doing that in a way that reuses and repurpose that for IntelliAgent. What I do not want to be doing is building for IntelliAgent and ADAPT separately because they're functionally, sorry, conceptually the same thing. So they need to be done very tightly coupled. The onboarding, it sounds like that's a really big thing. It's asking a couple of questions like, what's your name? What's your date of birth? I mean, I don't understand how onboarding has now suddenly become a big thing. If you're saying onboarding and the Y Workshop, yeah, I get that. But then you've just talked about the Y Workshop. So you can't use it twice.

12:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Like you said, the, okay. So kind of put you where we're at, like on our side, how things look, it's just things are changing so much. And I don't think it's very fair of you to always, it feels like you're all the time interpreting things, small changes, things that perceived to be, Oh, just add a button here to be not a lot of extra work, but you're very experienced in the IT field. So I'm wondering why you have all these assumptions. Why things shouldn't take this long. I understand from a point of view in the startup world, you need to get to market as fast as possible. You don't care if the code is clean, reuse as much as possible. If it works, that's great. That's what we want. That's also what we understand. We understand that's how the software world is for startups. But this assumption that things, that these small things, simple, seemingly simple things don't add a lot of overhead is incorrect.

13:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, so are you trying to equate, so in the wording that you used, it was insinuated that onboarding, which is asking a couple of questions, is the same as the why workshop. Just all my experience says that they are not the same.

14:10 - Jorge Lewis 
The onboarding process, as to my understanding, it includes getting the users onboard across this. So the onboarding day, so this includes gathering the user's information. So now you guys are using the understanding your why as kind of a lead magnet, right? That's the plan?

14:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we just moved it at a different part of the process before the payroll.

14:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So now the understanding your why is the lead magnet. So that's always going to be the first part of the journey, user journey. So after the complete understanding your why, then we have the asking the very simple questions, getting the information, right?

14:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

14:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
The onboarding, I'm assuming.

14:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Sir?

15:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello?

15:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Have I cut out or?

15:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I think it's going to cut out.

15:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that feels like a year.

16:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
You still there Jorge?

16:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, Rita is here by the way.

16:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah I know.

16:36 - Jorge Lewis 
His network is down.

16:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, I guess things will sit and stir.

16:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Do you know if he's coming back?

17:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello?

17:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

17:11 - Jorge Lewis 
He's gone. He said going out, going to have for a swim and be back later. Oh, okay.

17:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, just me and Gavin.

17:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, well let's get JP on now.

17:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, okay.

17:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, so I think meeting on new one.

17:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
So that three day I kind of like separates the meetings. Yeah, let's start a new one.

17:37 - Unidentified Speaker

Fri, Jul 26, 2024

0:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

0:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yes.

0:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Thank you very much.

1:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
for more.

1:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
you Hello?

2:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you hear me?

2:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, hello. Do you hear me?

2:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I hear you. How's it going?

2:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, doing great. Let me just find my earphones so that I can listen. Better because I can hear you guys.

2:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah no problem.

3:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, how's it going?

3:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'm just trying to sort out my webcam. Hold on a sec.

3:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, no problem.

3:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How's the trip to Spain going?

3:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. Can you guys see me now?

3:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I can hear you. The camera seems to be off sync with your voice. It's fine for me.

4:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, you guys are slow as well.

4:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

4:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. I've just woken up, so bear with me.

4:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

4:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I'm concerned about is that we're getting into a very explicit neutral.

4:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
saying the conversation will always be exactly these steps and it'll never deviate. That's not what we've talked about as a product here. And I want to check in. Is that where we're going or is that my bad assumption?

4:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that was more of a bad assumption, because we need an explicit example to be able to work and get to what your vision is. If we're just working with words you say, it's extremely difficult to discern what a session should look at. If you're teaching a human how to do life coaching or teaching a human anything, you need to give a human examples of how it works. If you're going to learn how to do a surgery, it's going to be different every time, but you should learn the procedures. You should learn fundamentally how things work.

5:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
So I think just examples are the best way to move forward. And it slowed us down a lot that we've just had to work from concepts within our heads. And we've never seen practical examples until what we're beginning to have now.

5:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So can we go through? Shall I bring up the moral or do one of you want to bring up, sorry, the figma? Which way do you want to do it?

5:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm in Figma right now. I think we can follow each other by clicking on the profile picture top right. I'm following you right now.

6:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
So.

6:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Will, are you seeing?

6:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
This section here. Yeah, you're there. I can see you there. This section here is just setting out all of the components that we would talk about in a diagram. So any questions on this?

6:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
No questions.

6:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Will, you're very low. I can hear Jonas quite well.

6:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, your volume is very low.

6:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK. How about now? Better?

6:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Much better. Much better.

6:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. No questions from me.

6:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the idea here is at a high level trying to capture the fact that you don't have an existing user. This is a new user. Becomes aware of the website through Instagram, advert, whatever. Or they sign up to the newsletter on the website, they become aware, they've signed up, I shouldn't say becomes, and then on the website, can sign up for a newsletter, or it can just, how do I do that?

7:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

7:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
They see, on the website, they see the Discover Why workshop. That pushes them to the mobile.

7:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
On the mobile, there'll be some invitation to do the Discover Your Why workshop, whatever wording we come up with. Will, you've got a questionnaire. If we start on Discovering Your Why workshop first, is it okay if we still start the workshop?

8:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why would that be a thing, Will?

8:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, this is an earlier... I asked this question because the Discover Your Why question is still being spec'd out in IntelliJ, so...

8:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I remember asking this if we work on the onboarding first while the IntelliAgent is working on the create your Y workshop.

8:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
So my understanding is just on that JP has changed that now.

8:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
to a unique value proposition workshop instead of a brand purpose workshop? Yeah. You mean? Yeah. Yeah. That's also where we're a bit misaligned. So do you know if it'll be a unique value proposition workshop or if it'll be a brand purpose workshop?

8:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, JP said it's a unique value proposition. I think that's what it is. It's his product, don't mind.

9:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
If the brand workshop is a pound and the value proposition workshop is 5,000 pounds, well, that's a different conversation.

9:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

9:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
So fundamentally, no, we're not onboarding. This is about giving people the experience of our product to convert them to a sale. So the answer to that is no.

9:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Got it.

9:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
So just one question I had here is, where in the process would the user tell the program, I already have an account?

9:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, Jonas. I got the first part of that, and then you broke up.

9:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. Where in this process would the user tell the program that they've already signed up? Just to get that out of the way.

10:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
So they haven't signed up yet.

10:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but the user could also have signed up. When they open the app, if this is how the conversation starts immediately, where will the user be able to tell? Let me make this more clear.

10:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me, let me, let me, let me finish. Let me finish. So on the mobile app, there's obviously going to be the ability to sign in. I haven't done an existing user workflow yet. This is just a new user workflow. I want to get that lined in.

10:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

10:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
So what sign in the, before the workshop star starts or where, like where just in between her, what does sign up process be?

10:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, so this is a I'm new to the product.

11:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm experiencing this to decide whether I sign up or not. Now I could skip all this and just sign up or I can skip all this and sign in.

11:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. So you should be able to skip the workshop and just sign up if you want to. It will not, I will not this workshop be essential to, like why one would, like this workshop, the output from this workshop will be used in all conversations and everything moving forward to make the application more efficient, right?

11:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Not necessarily more efficient, but more relevant.

11:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. More relevant, more valuable. Yeah.

11:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I don't think we need to be so literal, right? They could be 20 minutes into this workshop and they might need to go out shopping and they stop it. They never finished the workshop. So the next time they come in, there would have to be the option to continue the workshop, sign up, sign in. Maybe they signed up on the website and they're already logged in.

12:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
The workshop is required before you start the program, right? To finish the workshop.

12:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sorry?

12:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Finishing this URY workshop is required before continuing with the program, right?

12:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Before continuing with the program, yes, we would need to have it. But it doesn't have to be a precursor to signing up.

12:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK. So we're going to have, OK, from what I'm hearing, we're going to have a Y workshop where the user can opt in to participate or skip and just sign up, right?

12:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we don't want to be hard-coding this, that you must do these things in the earlier days. You should be able to drop out of the process and go, hey, this is really cool. Yeah, I want to sign up. Fine.

12:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
But then after you sign up, do you continue your Y-Workshop? Yeah. Yeah. Technically, that's just kind of more difficult to implement then, because then we have to track when the user signs up and how the program should be continued.

13:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, my concern, I understand what you're saying, but my concern is, is that I think people might just be messing around with the product and not do a real workshop. Um, in the pre sort of, they're just testing us and they go, ah, this is pretty cool. Okay. Now I'll sign up. They don't know that this is a step one of the actual program.

13:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think there's a different experience when someone hasn't paid for something and when someone has paid for something.

13:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think once you sign up, we could then ask them, Hey, you know, are you happy to use the, the, you know, the, why the existing one, or do you want to do a new one? Maybe we could do it that way.

14:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

14:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, okay. Do it that way then. Okay.

14:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, uh, that's possible. It's just, uh, yeah, just with introducing more flows, more like directions where the user can sign off and start this program and all of that, uh, that will increase the scope of it.

14:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, compared to just having one hard code and stuff where they sign up.

14:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So Jonas, once you sign up, it's literally a question. Do you want to use the existing why workshop or do you want to do a new one? You do a new one, you just run the workshop again. That doesn't seem like a colossal feature.

14:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
From my experience, go on Jonas.

14:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sorry, go on Will. I'll say mine after.

14:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
yeah from my experience there would be we would have to invoke this is from a tech a bit technical perspective but we would need to create a way in which the first Y Workshop is already stored in the mobile device's internal storage so that it could be used again.

15:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
That might be a little difficult. Sorry, Will, can you turn your video off? Or can we all turn our video off? Just because I think my signal is not great and it's struggling.

15:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, OK.

15:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK. So from my experience, in order to implement what you're saying, I think we might need to create a way to save the user's first Y Workshop results into the mobile device or the device the user is using, and that might add in additional complexity because we're going to have to save the device.

15:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, it has to be saved anyway. How can you not save the workshop?

16:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I don't think that's the issue. The issue I'm more seeing is just the state management. When, like, creating the process, there is always a state going on. Creating disruptions to the state where the workshop can and can't exist at the same time just creates more scenarios we have to account for in the code, basically. So that's more so what can come...

16:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Which means the workshop cannot exist.

16:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
When the user has signed up, if we ensure that the workshop has been completed before they sign up, we know we'll always have that. When they're signed up, we'll never have to account for them not having done the workshop. Meanwhile, if they can have done it, can have partially done it, and can have not done it at all, then those are all three scenarios we have to account for. When it's in the signed up UI, if that makes sense.

17:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
I understand that, but you've also got to look at what is the customer experience here, right? We all know that when people try something for free, they mess around.

17:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
I understand that that would be a better customer experience. I'm just informing you that that can lead to an increase in scope. We'll have to estimate that properly after, but yeah.

17:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, what sort of impact? I mean, technically, yes, it's an increase in scope. But are you talking like it's an hour's work, it's a month's worth of work? What are you talking about here?

17:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hours, maybe days. But yeah, it shouldn't be too much.

17:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is becoming very frustrating just from my point of view. We're getting into this massive analysis paralysis where we're losing weeks and weeks to spinning wheels.

17:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just to let you know, I'm getting quite frustrated.

18:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So can we go back onto the app now?

18:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
So then there's an introduction section.

18:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
cities and let me know when you're ready to start. Let me just see.

18:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just don't know whether.

18:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think actually that's probably the right, I think that text goes in there. But anyway, it doesn't really matter. Those texts are just an example. And I'm assuming when the client says ready, it could be any form of positive confirmation. And that could be, they might ask questions, they might, you know, I can't possibly speculate the array of questions that a customer might ask here.

19:16 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

19:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. We'll take it into consideration too.

19:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, they might say, how do I make popcorn?

19:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. I think there's some kind of prompt engineering we could do to like invalidate those kinds of questions, but that's a thing we might discuss with the technical team, but I'll include it in this.

19:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, like with regards to questions like that, how to make popcorn, I think it's a technical question, technical implementation problem and not necessarily a product problem. What do you think?

20:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, everything's a product problem and everything's technical, so I don't really need to fix things.

20:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
It also depends on how much you want to invest into accounting for users that don't seriously use the platform. For example, we could have one agent just list listening in the background, that's whose sole job is just detecting bullshit. And when it detects bullshit, it can ask the user to get serious. But I think it largely just depends on how much time we want to invest in accounting for users that aren't seriously using the program.

20:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I think with every chatbot that's out there, there is a subject matter that it's related to. And then there is stuff that it's not prepared to talk about. So if it goes in and says, um, can you give me some medical advice on how to have an abortion? We, we can't answer that question. That's not bullshit. It's just not a question. So any product that doesn't have a scope of what it will talk about and what it won't talk about, there is no product. I mean, I spoke to George about this from the very get go. You have to be able to talk about things and not talk about things.

21:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

21:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's very possible to filter out messages that aren't in the subject.

22:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
So they're doing the introduction. They've then handed over to the coaching agent. Is that clear?

22:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yep. Yeah.

22:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is the same chat window. The mentor is still present, but now it's been run by Maria, the coach.

22:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

22:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, this first section, again, we explained the background. That could be multiple conversations. I didn't want to be laborious about it here, but I can break that out if you need me to.

22:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, this one is fine. The introduction is good.

22:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Fine.

23:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then across the top here, there's two different major scenarios. They either know their issue or they don't know their issue. And so I've broken out one flow for weight loss.

23:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a billion different ways to say weight loss. I want to get into a dress. I have a wedding coming up that I can't fit into. I want to look good on the beach. All of that is weight loss.

23:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

23:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then this section here.

23:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just to clarify, so these are purely measures of success, right?

23:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
They are the goals. It's what the user would call goals. But then, yes, we would then tell them that they are actually what we call them in the program are measures of success.

23:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
In addition to this measure of success, are we also looking to get their core why, like these up here, something deeper than fitting into a dress?

24:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, because that's pretty deep for people, that is. So be really clear. Most people will call golds, like I want to lose my weight. That is the goal. I want to lose weight. So I need to put some tags on this. Hold on a second.

24:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
So these are your Ys then. And I want to do losing weight as a measure of success.

24:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
How do I get this down?

25:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can also press S on your keyboard to make like sticky notes.

25:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sorry?

25:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can press S on your keyboard to make like sticky So this is their initial user goal.

25:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

25:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
We then go deeper and we tease that apart. And so what would that feel like, And there's loads of different questions here. You just go deeper and deeper and deeper. These are more deeper emotional insights into the user goal. So what happens when you have those things, all of these things, for example, when they struggle with the program, we might be saying, Hey, remember that passion that you had for traveling? Yeah. This is why you're doing this. So these are things we're going to call upon later in the program. When people should start getting challenged, this is the fuel that's going to help them do the hard things.

26:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

26:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I got it.

26:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Does that make sense?

26:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's clear.

26:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So at some point this process finishes and I'm not entirely sure how I can tell you when that finishes. It's quite subjective. Like you don't want to ask 50 times and, and it's sort of, it comes to a natural ending. That's something that you just feel as a, you know, I haven't explicitly said to you that we're moving to the next point. You just haven't had more questions and it just sort of felt like it was time to move on. I don't know how to codify that, but that's something that I would assume has to come through the training.

26:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

26:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Will, you've got a question. If I remember correctly, there's an emphasis on making sure that the goals of the user...

27:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
I wish I'd never used smart because it's not useful. Um, it is, and it's not useful. Um, we're not reinforcing the user's goals. That's what they're coming in with potentially. They may not have a goal and that's something that's a separate workflow. Uh, I'll come into, but this is, I know, I know I want to lose weight. We then go deeper into what will be the benefit of all of that. So this is more emotional. We then are educating them about the benefit of converting this user goal into a, uh, what we call measures of success.

28:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

28:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, if I'm getting it right, basically, if the issue is known, we ask deeper and deeper to determine their core motivations, like what motivates them to this specific goal and create measures of success. So for example, if I want to lose weight, I'm motivated because I want to, let's say, run at a marathon. And so my measure of success is losing 10 pounds, something along those lines.

28:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes.

28:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Got it.

28:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Uh, then the question, what if the response is something like I have just been diagnosed with prediabetes? Do we turn that into a measure of success or where does the arrow go from here basically?

28:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
So again, it will go into this process here again. So the, Well, you tell me, given something can be an initial user goal and an emotional insight or a measure of success, what is pre-diabetes initially? What is pre-diabetes?

29:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Emotional?

29:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's an initial user goal.

29:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

29:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then we would talk to them about saying, you know, really sorry about that. You know, that that's, that's not a, you know, for me, if I would say, I would say, OK.

30:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
But this is a very different initial response because prediabetes is not something I chose where weight loss is.

31:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so you have to acknowledge where the customer is.

31:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

31:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then you might do something like...

31:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
You might say something like this.

31:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
You might say something like,

32:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

32:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Walk through.

32:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just making up all these different examples. I don't know. There's all sorts of different questions I would do.

32:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

32:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
And all of this is just going deeper and trying to get the emotional insights behind the user goal.

32:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK.

33:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
And we're still seeking measures of success, like achievable, measurable measures of success with these Ys? What Ys?

33:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I have just been diagnosed with diabetes.

33:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Guys, we've got to be consistent. We've just called them. We've just established they're called user goals, and then you're calling them all these different things.

33:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is not a goal saying I want to get rid of my diabetes. That's a goal, no? I have been diagnosed with it. It's not a goal.

33:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm sure it's a hint to what the goal would be, which I imagine is getting rid of it or coping with it. But it's not a measurable goal.

34:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how do I...

34:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
So...

34:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's a fair point, so.

34:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe it's something like this.

34:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
something like that.

35:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

35:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Um, yeah.

35:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, we're still trying to turn this into measure. Yeah. Go measure. Do we want measurable, achievable, realistic?

35:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, I'm going to take back what I said then. And Will, I think you were on the right path.

35:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think in order for this to be a measure of success, the quality of a measure of success is that it's smart. So it's specific. I think that's what you've just done.

35:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
We assess whether it's achievable. Can you wait? I mean, if they want to go from 200 pounds to one pound, that's not achievable.

35:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

35:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not realistic. It's not measurable. And time-bound, there are different variations of what time-bound means. It's like, in what period of time will you hope to achieve this by? So if they're reversing the prediabetes, he thinks sort of like, yeah, I think I'm going to do this in a month. We're like, no, you're not. This is at least probably a three to 12-month journey, depending on where you are and how diligent you are in what you do. So you're right, there is possibly a... Okay, so there's probably a phase here to here.

36:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Make sure the user goal is specific, measurable, achievable. So if it's achievable, it has to be like, can we actually do it? Is it technically possible?

37:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, we would assess that if they say, you know, can people lose weight 100%? So we wouldn't have to ask them that question. If they want to go to the moon, that's not a goal that we can help you with. Sorry. And Realistic and time. So the measurable, achievable, realistic.

37:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think specific is a set of questions that we do here to get it specific. I think there has to be a timing question is like, you know, So I want to lose weight. That's fine. But I think, actually, it's possibly. Cool. So do you mind sharing your existing weight and target weight?

38:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, shit. What just happened there?

38:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Looks like the entire box was moved.

38:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could I ask one question more about the process order here? The high-level process order?

38:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

38:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
So if I was partaking in this, or how I've been imagining it, is this second step here is what I expect to come first. First, we want to figure out the core, the deep emotional insights of the goal. And after we've figured that out, I'd go forward with trying to turn that into a smart goal. Instead of first deriving the smart goal and then trying to find a deeper emotional connection.

39:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
I could be wrong there. I'm not a life coach, but that's just.

39:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, how important is it that the sequence of these things are locked in because you're, you're right. There will be different times, the path you'll do each of these steps, but the sequence might not be the consistent from one client to another client. Because you're right, because they might just go, they might come in going, fuck me, I need to lose weight. And you're like, Oh, I can see this is really important for you. And because they're so emotional, what you just said is absolutely the right thing to do. Yeah. But it might not always be. So how prescriptive do we need to be in the sequence here or the order of things?

39:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
I suppose maybe if it's if it's voice, you could probably insinuate some of the emotion. But if we don't have that option, we're not going to be able to do that.

40:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I guess it would just be being able to tell when to move on. But if you were doing coaching and someone said, I want to lose weight, or I have been diagnosed with prediabetes, or any of these four, really, would you start with trying to get the emotional connection? Or would you start with trying to turn it into a smart goal?

40:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to ask Sonia that. I don't want to skip my opinion. Give me two seconds. Yeah, go ahead.

41:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
How's it going, Darwin?

41:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep. Doing great. Chinmay is asking me a lot in private messages.

41:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, first of all, as George always says, we shouldn't really be communicating in private messages. It should be in the public channel so that we're all synced up.

41:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

41:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me just message him.

41:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll leave you to that.

42:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, yeah, well, Q&A is still out. I remember a story in one of my company wherein a different team of ours destroyed a prod because they were chatting privately.

42:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow, yeah.

42:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, the whole story is this other team, they're managing a pizza chain that's in peak hours, that was running in peak hours, and then one of the junior developers messaged a server admin if they could push the changes without the project manager's approval. They said it was like a small bug fix, and it was on a Friday too.

43:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
It sounds like you're describing what literally just happened with the crash. Yeah. Yeah. It's on a Friday. It's just this little bug fix that they're pushing without testing.

43:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
So I am.

43:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think your instincts are spot on. I'm speaking to Sonia. She's got to pop out to a friend of hers, unfortunately, who's got cancer. So she hasn't seen her in a long time. So she's going out to see her now for the day, and I've got the kids.

43:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
you're, you're right. And her view would be is when the customer comes in with, I want to lose weight, I want to reverse pride pre-diabetes. The next thing is you want to start visualizing life or what life will be like about when you fix this problem. So it's all about sort of pumping them up, getting them massively excited, getting deeper into that emotion. And once you've done that, then you'll start saying, okay, so that's really important. We've got that energy now. We're going to use that because it's going to get tough at times. So now let's just get specific and figure out the SMART aspects of it. So you're right, we need to reverse these around.

44:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this section, this section here.

44:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why can't that move down?

44:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
goes there.

44:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I accidentally moved it back.

45:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so I'm just going to go.

45:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
So okay, so this is the I feel like there's almost a section before this again, which is clarifying what the goal is. So for example, if I have just been diagnosed with prediabetes, we need to turn this into a goal before being able to visualize the future when the problem is fixed.

45:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe making them visualize the problem being fixed helps find out what the goal is.

45:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, I sort of made an assumption there that someone saying I've been, I've been diagnosed with prediabetes that they're coming to us to reverse it. Right.

46:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

46:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, and I think this is the challenge, right? Someone said to me, you know, yeah, yeah, you might want to do that. So, um, any clarifying.

46:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, then I'd be like afraid of it sounding too much like you're speaking with a robot writing rather than a human. If I come in and I say like, my doctor just said I'll die in two years because of my weight. And then the bot asks me So do you want to get rid or fix your weight problem? Then it's like, if that was a human, of course, that's obvious. I kind of think where it's like, it sounds like I'm speaking to a bot where it's just kind of disregarding my problem and my emotions and rather just trying to clarify for clarification sake.

47:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
could be a concern, but could also be good to get it clarified. Because if it's not their concern, or if they don't have the gold yet, or they're trying to figure it out, then it could be different.

47:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

47:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you think?

47:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, I think that's, that's exactly what we want to avoid in terms of, you know, the idea that It doesn't sound human or humane is probably more important rather than human.

47:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I like this way of phrasing it though. What do you do? What do you hope to achieve from working with that? Because then it's more of an open question.

47:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. We tend to try, certainly coaching tends to ask very open, open questions because early stage, you don't know where the customer wants to go. So the open questions allows them to give us more context rather than us trying to be very specific at the outset.

48:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I think that probably handles the concern I have for the most part.

48:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So any clarifying questions on the problem to a goal on the problem?

48:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll try to ask open questions to establish the user go.

48:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
My laptop is about to run out of battery one moment.

48:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

48:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
You need to go or?

49:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just have to run and get my charger. It's saying 0%, so if I suddenly drop out, then you know what happened.

49:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yep, take care. Success, it's plugged in.

49:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Run like the wind, I guess.

49:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Huh?

49:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Run like the wind.

49:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I'm back now. I got it. Yeah, sorry about that interruption.

49:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Guys, I need to drop off for a little bit. I'll reconnect with you in a couple of hours. Well, probably not less than an hour and a half when I come back.

49:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

49:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I think this is useful to tease it apart, but I'm concerned that I'm doing this in isolation to Sonia. I think I need to bring her more into this process, but she won't be around until later today. But we can continue this journey when we come back. Or if you guys, now I understand where your head's coming from If you guys do want to put questions into this, I can answer when I come back, and then we can jump back on a call.

50:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I don't have any immediate questions right now. OK. But it seems like we're moving in the right direction now, though, where a lot of things are being cleared up. Perfect. Yeah.

50:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cool. All right.

50:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I'll see you then. Bye bye. Have a good day.

50:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Have a good day.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (17).txt"

Sat, Jul 20, 2024

0:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
but it smells really bad. Okay. Right.

0:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, thing is, most people, right, are living their life eating, making loads of decisions that eventually their system sort of breaks.

0:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it's not like one cigarette doesn't harm you, but smoking for your life does.

0:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
We also know, for example, when you hit 75, wherever you are on your muscle mass, nature falls that off a cliff.

1:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
You can't stop that. But what you can do is choose what level of muscle you have on your body when you are 75. As men, Most men in the world retire at 66.

1:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you think the age is that they die or have a serious medical event that changes their ability to enjoy life?

1:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Personally, I've always heard the figure like 80.

1:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
The data for America says 70.

2:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Wow.

2:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we, we get, we get four years after breaking our balls for 45, 50 years working. Um, but you can change that. Um, the other thing is most people as women, how long do women tend to live after their husbands? Most, most men die way before their wives.

2:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't know.

2:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So women tend to live 15 years longer than men.

2:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
And if you go to a lot of places, certainly in Northern Europe, um, there's a lot of old women. There isn't a lot of old men, just, just the way, the way it is. That's not true in Japan and stuff like that, but in Europe that is. There's a lot of stuff contributing to all of this, which is people's sort of lack of exercise. The food we eat is probably the two biggest ones.

3:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
But there's lots of stuff that we can do. And what we're trying to do with the whole purpose of ADAPT is to start people changing their habits so they get that red line. And in theory, they're going to get healthier. So do you guys know the concept of a pension?

3:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Financially?

3:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. A financial pension.

3:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Basically you give money to an entity so that once you retire, you get an allowance, right?

3:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
A hundred percent. And the younger you start, the better it is for you because it's compound interest over time. I really wish I paid attention more to that when I was younger, but, um, you don't realize that when you're young, you only realize it when you're old. Um, and it's the same for health. So the whole principle of adapt is it's a health pension.

4:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
People don't realize that once you retire, whenever that retirement event is, 66, whatever it is, but you just have age. So you have your 50s, you have your 60s, you have your 70s, you have your 80s.

4:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's stuff that we need to do all the way here because nature will start withdrawing for you. Your lifestyle will start withdrawing for you as you get older. So while we retire and we have a set age financially, let's say we retire at 65 or 66, the health pension is all the time. So nature is withdrawing from you. And you're accelerating that withdrawal if you have a shit lifestyle and eating shit food and not exercising. And so we sort of have refined the ADAPT message a little bit over the last week. We were speaking to an investor last week and he gave us some feedback and it's made us really think about like, what are we? So we're definitely not a weight loss program, even though you would lose weight. I mean, Interestingly, just looking at the call here, nobody on this call needs to lose weight. Everyone's pretty healthy, which is good.

5:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I just want to pause there. Does that sort of make sense that the whole purpose of ADAPT, and it's this concept of paying into a health pension, and that's what we're trying to help people do?

6:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely for me. Anyone else that's confused on that theme?

6:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

6:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Originally, what we had planned was, we had planned this course 10 to reinforce, to predominantly What are you eating, moving, sleep, mind? So there's four areas that you need to do stuff in, in order to, you know, start changing your life.

6:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
And one of the challenges is that, so I signed up before I started ADAPT, I signed up with this guy who helps people reverse something what's called pre-diabetes. Um, and, I had basically achieved in a month what most people take a year to do with him, just because I made a decision and I stuck to it. Most people don't have that diligence. They will do a bit and they do it for a day and I'm like, oh, whatever. So his program's not been very much useful to me because I've done everything. He just says, do this and I've done it. And I don't deviate from that where most people would. So originally where we said, right, eat, move, sleep, mind, And our original market we were going to go after was weight loss, but not being a weight loss program. A lot of weight loss programs, what the data says is that if you're this weight here and you come down to this weight here within a year, 95% of the people will have put on the same weight or more within a year.

8:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the reason is, is that when the goal is weight loss, and you've achieved it, the goal isn't maintenance, it's very tough. So actually what the goal should be is to walk every day, because that never finishes. The goal should be to don't eat seed oils, don't eat processed foods. Those goals will be ever present. And the idea is that we want to slice these habits into way smaller than we've currently been talking to you about. Into these micro habits really really small achievable things Now new problem over my head. What if someone's doing 40 40 habits? We can't do 40 check-ins a day That's gonna fucking piss people off. So I don't have an answer to that by the way Let me to have a think about how the hell we fix that problem. I don't know what it is so The original idea was that we had an LMS That would you would have content allocations to each day of each week, and it's drip fed out, right? So you would have something around eat, move, mind, sleep, and I'll take you through what we think a day looks like,

9:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
So rather than, and I don't have a full answer for this yet, I'm still percolating on it, still trying to figure out the answer.

9:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
We need to figure out a way of for each of these, what are the habits that each of these guys have?

10:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
There may not be the same number in each of them. And I might choose to do different ones to Jonas or Will. We may not all have the same path. The problem with the LMS approach was it was the same path. We're not going to stop the LMS, by the way. I'm just trying to figure out how to reimagine it, what it actually means. I just don't have an answer for it yet. But the idea is that there are some people who are going to move fast and some people who are going to move slow. How do we accommodate both of them? There are some people who are just going to take a habit, do it, take a habit, do it, take a habit, do it. Others are not. And we've got to accommodate both of those worlds. And I don't know how to do that yet. I haven't come up with an answer.

10:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
But fundamentally, the idea is, like a pension, every time you do positive habits, you're paying in. Every time you do something bad, you're taking out. So yesterday, for example, I went to the cinema with my wife, and I had some shit food. I don't do it very often. I do it very rarely. But I had some yesterday so that would be a negative thing but I also did positive things so it was it was overarching a positive day but not as positive as other days. How the hell do we quantify that? Now the challenge with all of this is and I'm we're going to try and maybe speak to a university to try and get someone to help us build a model of is there like a um Do you have something? Do you know flower shops? There's an international flower trade called Interflora.

11:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you want to buy somebody flowers in another country, there's a network called Interflora that allows one florist in one country to speak to another country. This is before the internet, right? Now, all those companies, all florists in the world use a currency called florins. Which basically calibrates them and it protects them from currency fluctuations. So it means if a rose is four florins, it's four florins across the world, it just costs locally a different amount to buy the four florins. It stops trading and currency fluctuations from impacting small businesses basically. So in that same way is like, what is the value of walking for a mile? Or five miles versus having a glass of wine or having a cigarette or not doing something today.

12:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's the value of doing that if you have prediabetes or you're diabetic or you've got heart disease? So the thing is that if each of us here have the same diet, we will all respond differently because our bodies are unique. And there is no, I mean, there's some universal truth like don't smoke, but beyond that, it's very nuanced to the individual in terms of what is truly healthy. Will, you look confused.

13:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, I understand what you're saying. It's just that I'm thinking of it from a technical perspective and I'm, yeah, I'm a bit wondering how the hell can we do that?

13:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Exactly. That's exactly where I'm at as well. I don't believe it's technical. I think this is mathematical at the moment because we have to come up with some form of a weighted model. For example, there's a bullshit. I don't know if you've ever heard of what's called the BMI, which is your body mass index. It's horseshit because most rugby players would be considered obese by the manufacturer. But for the average person, it's sort of indicative. It's sort of okay. So what we need to be, and this is the challenge, we need to be roughly right rather than precisely wrong. So we're going to have a subjective point of view on this, and we're going to have to try and get some independent body to create the weighting or the maths model around this, that a glass of wine is a unit and whatever that unit happens to be. And then if you do walks, that equates to some other unit. So there will be some, some sort of handshake, I don't know what it is yet. Yeah, Jonas?

14:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
From that to me, I'd be a bit afraid of users like excusing a cup of wine or like indulging in bad habits because they do something else. If that makes sense, they create bad habits because they excuse it with like, oh, it's only this amount of points or whatever.

14:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

14:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
That is, Well, I mean, that's sort of what I rationalized yesterday, isn't it?

15:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

15:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
But that's a one-time thing, what you did. But if someone starts a habit, starts a small bad thing every day because they're doing this bad walking routine, that's so much better. This isn't a commentary on the implementation or anything. I'm just wondering what you think about it.

15:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think it's a risk. I think it's also...

15:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
At the end of the day, people can lie about what they're doing as well.

15:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is, for want of a better basis, this is a game. This is not medical advice. This is supposed to help you. And yeah, we're going to have to go and get some legal advice in terms of how are we exposing ourselves legally by even suggesting some of these things to people. But we'll figure that out over time. But yes, the idea is that What people don't realize is that the majority of their diets are actually desserts. It's all basically carbs and sugar. And then they have one thing at the end of the day called dessert. It's like, no, no, no. Every single meal you've had is a dessert. And so there's a huge re-education piece to help people, you know, right the shit. So if I was to look at this sort of technically now for a moment, and I'll share my screen.

16:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so we have, I'm just trying to figure out, where is it?

16:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Nope.

16:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I've got a load of old stuff here. I'm just wanna make sure I don't wanna bother. I don't think you need to see that.

17:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right, okay, right, okay.

17:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just going to write some stuff out here.

18:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I'll be with you in two seconds, guys.

18:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me know when you can see that. Can you see this?

19:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you guys see it, yeah?

19:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yep, I can see it. Sorry, it wasn't me.

19:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it starts with awareness. So this could be social media campaign, paid for advertising, whatever it is. Someone becomes aware that Adapt exists. They will then sign up where we would capture an email on a newsletter. So this already exists today. What doesn't exist is the ability for them to then register. And register is just payment.

19:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
We would then start agent onboarding. So we want the agent to onboard them rather than filling in forms and stuff like that. We wanted to educate them that there is an agent that's capable of doing these things and owns a relationship. An agent onboarding has the sense of profile field. So do you drink coffee? What's your date of birth? Blah, blah, blah. Whatever fields we find important. And then there's the first sort of coaching session. It's about clarifying your why and your goals. So when things get tough and people find this difficult, it's going to be the why they're doing this is going to help them stay motivated and stay on course.

20:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is the fuel that keeps them applying healthier habits as opposed to The goal is what they're achieving. So a lot of people will say, I want to lose weight. They think that's the goal. We will shift their mindset to say that losing weight is a measure. The goal is to stick to healthy habits. That's, what's got to be the goal.

20:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the why is going to be there. Why supportive with some education around the, like a lot of what I said at the start there about what happens in the future, like when you're older and that this healthy pension stuff. So that's, what's that going to be. So. We would then explain why this is important. So that's similar to the IntelliAgent contact setting. That's all that is. So I can change that now. So that's context setting.

21:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Explain.

21:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, if we say to them, what are your goals? They might have something measurable, tangible, like I want to lose weight. I want to fit into this dress size. It's very clear. We need to, we need to iterate on that with them as coaches to get very, very clear on what that goal is. And it has smart attributes. Have you ever heard of smart goals?

21:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's just a measurable, specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. So they're just qualities of what a goal is. Um, And the idea is that we would shift them that their goal is most likely a measure of success as opposed to the goal.

22:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if it's weight loss, the weight loss is your measure of success. It's not the goal. The goal is the habits every day. And then we go establishing the why, lock it in deep. This is going deep onto their emotions, what they want to feel. So Chinmay, we talked about this when we worked through the session with you. So that sort of helped you understand this. And then we're trying to figure out whether we do this bit. We don't know whether we start talking about the obstacles and what's going to get in their way of doing this. We're not 100% sure, but I think we will. I'm going to leave it orange for now. Now, if someone doesn't have any goals, We need to help them. The yellows are coaching sessions, by the way. We need to help establishing their goals. This is the legacy concept of a goal, like losing weight. It'll be something tangible, which we will then turn that into their measure of success. If they have lots of goals, we'll need to prioritize them and pick out one, because having too many doesn't make sense. And so it could be, you know, Sleep time, I want to sleep eight hours a day. It could be my timetable, gym. There's different sessions. So that will be the end of the onboarding. And then the idea is that on a, and this is actually, I don't know if I'm going to show this section because, and the reason I want to pause for a second and I welcomed the conversation now. Hello puppy. My dog's just come in to say hello. Hello. You okay?

23:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
What was its name?

23:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Shelby. Come here, baby. Come on. Shelby.

23:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Come on.

23:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Up.

23:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Come on up. I know you're tired. Come on up. Up. Say hello. Come on. There we go.

23:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hi.

23:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
He was...

24:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

24:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're going back there. You're sleepy. Yeah, I'm still sleepy. She's only just woken up. She wants me to take her for a walk.

24:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the reason why I paused those mobile screens there was that that was sort of predicated on a known daily content being sent to you by an agent because you're doing a 10-week program and what happens on every day is the same regardless of the person.

24:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not saying we don't do that, by the way, but I don't want to presume that's what we do. I think I want to have a week to play with my head and figure out what we're actually going to do. Because the principle now is across eat, move, mind, and sleep, there's going to be a load of micro habits Like one habit might be, if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it.

25:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
If it's got an ingredient you can't pronounce, don't eat it.

25:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you didn't make it, don't eat it. If your grandmother wouldn't have made it, don't eat it. So they're not really habits that you do every day. They're sort of guiding principles, which are sort of habits. But this is my point. I could be very concerned that very quickly, if you're tracking these every day, Like imagine if you make a thousand pounds contribution to your pension, you don't ask, did you put that pound in? Did you put that pound in? Did you put that? You don't, you don't ask a thousand times. You just say, well, it's a thousand pounds. You did all of it. So it's going to be a lot easier from a financial point of view. I don't know how we're going to do it for this. Cause this only really happened in the last three or four days, this sort of clarification of, of habits and stacking. So, um, The idea will be, is there still going to be content to help you when you take on a new habit? It will unlock some content. And whether we go, it's always incremental habits. And maybe once a week, there's a check-in. You have a habit dashboard. Are you doing all of these? Are you not doing all of these? Don't know. Because again, we don't want it to be overwhelming for people.

26:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I used to have a weight tracking app a year ago or two when I was doing a diet. That weight loss app, no, a weight tracker app had a pretty similar feature where it had like three tabs at the bottom, it was just BMI, which I didn't care about, the tracker, where I just entered every day and it gave me a graph, and a habit section, which is pretty similar to what you're describing. It was focused on establishing good small habits, but it didn't really, it was very simple. It had just a grid layout of just don't leave before you sleep, run 10 minutes a day and such. When you activated one of them, it just gave you like a checkbox for each day in the month. And you just, whenever you opened the app on a day, since I tracked every day in the morning, it also gave me the checkbox. Did you do this today? I just clicked, but it didn't work well for me.

27:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
It didn't really help. So why, why, why did you think it doesn't help?

27:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
There was no real pull through. It was kind of just a checkbox each day. There was nothing to consult about. It was just don't eat before bed. And that's a decision I can make independently of clicking the checkbox each day, if that makes sense.

28:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

28:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's more if I didn't do it, then I'd want to go in and say, hey, I didn't do it. But I'm not sure. That's something a heart is told.

28:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, I've not heard that word, parasocial.

28:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry?

28:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
You asked a question there and I don't understand the question. Sorry. I don't know what a parasocial relationship is.

28:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, okay. Basically, it's a common term in streaming culture wherein you develop a social relationship with an entity that doesn't really Oh yeah, basically you develop a relationship with an entity. So what I was thinking about is maybe instead of like a weekly tracker or whatnot, we turn the AI trainer into a friend or a consultant type.

29:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, there's a whole business around AI girlfriends. So I think people forming relationships with entities, I don't think that's the issue. But one of the things I've just realized, There's two main work streams here.

29:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
One is the habits and what we're doing there. The reality is that people, one of our assumptions is, people will be given information and totally believe that if I do this thing, it's good for me. And yet I will do this thing.

29:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, at some point, that behavior becomes a problem. I know this is good for me, but yet I do this. When you're 20, doesn't really fucking matter because you've got so much time in your body so fast, it's able to get over all this stuff, but at a point it becomes a problem. And so people have, this is the second part of the coaching. And the most important part of the coaching is helping people understand why are they doing this bad behavior? Because it's serving them at some level. Maybe it reminds them of something, defiance against their father, or I don't know, there's all of this deep rooted stuff that we're not aware of But until you get connected to that and you let go of it, you can't do the new behavior.

30:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I got that medical advice that if I didn't change what I was doing, I was probably gonna have a heart episode and probably die within five years. So I was highly motivated to do that. But I've noticed probably in the last month, I have let go the very rigorous approach that I was doing. So I'm in more of a maintenance mode now. And I think it's important that we understand that when we do things that are not helpful to us, why do we not do that? And there is this framework around the immunity to change, which is a video that we shared previously. It's a framework of these five steps and going. It's helping people do that. So we are having this assumption that coaching people will actually help them understand their bad behavior so they can start doing the good behavior.

31:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
So do you get that? So there's the one part is content. Here are good habits to do and tracking them. However, we decide to do that. The most important part is People probably won't do the good things for them, and helping them understand why, and through coaching, unlocking that, using specifically the immunity to change framework.

31:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
HMI.

31:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
Hi, so what I was thinking was you know for like there's no way to you know measure each and everything like with the pension formula that you mentioned there's no way to measure things like statically like everything has to be dynamic and we cannot define like we cannot have predefined measures like what a glass of wine could be like you said it could be Non-harmful for somebody, but it could be harmful for somebody. So a solution is that we have, I, what I think is at the end of each week, uh, like the data is calculated every day, right? The data is fetched. The data is collected and stored in the database every day. And using the data of six days or six and a half days at the tech on the seventh day, there needs to be a behavioral analysis. Of which habits did the user like, is he trying to put in those habits? Is he trying to make efforts or is he failing to do so?

33:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't disagree with you. However, if I look at this as a, as a company, right. And I'm going to go to somebody and say, Hey, give us a million quid. Because we want to go really big, and we want to go do marketing, and blah, blah, whatever. The thing that's most unique here is the ability to coach somebody.

33:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because otherwise, you're just pushing content in a different type of window, and we've got some form of a model that gives you a nice indicator or something. Loads of people are going, did you do that? Did you do that? Reminders, Apple's got reminders, you know, stuff like that.

33:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

33:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I'm most interested in is can we create a bot that actually coaches like really coaches you?

34:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. I mean, uh, that's what I was pointing out because for each individual user, if you want to coach him the way he is or she is, you need data on the user. So if we have. Data on the user's activities. Let's say we have a week's data for the user's activities. You can Analyze the user's behavior. You can create a behavior analysis You can match that with the onboarding data what the user's goal were what psychology psychological reasons were for why he wants to You know why he wants to make progress why he signed up for this Course and you can also I think what something external from the technical point of view, which we need is. Uh, like data from research from habit, like there's research on people's habits, like there's, uh, research from psychologists, the research research data from therapists. I think that's what we need, uh, at, and I think that would be too.

35:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
too much computation if we do it every day. That's why I proposed every week.

35:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, so I think what you're speaking to is what I agree with is the, like at some point the system needs to observe that someone's not doing good things. And then you'd say, Hey, listen, we need to have a coaching session. It's probably going to be an hour. So when can we schedule that? And then we, we, we have all of the context of what they've been doing in order to run that session.

35:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's aspect one. The innate ability to do the coaching is what I'm talking about, regardless of when you schedule it or stuff like that. The actual ability, if you look at Thrive AI, the one I sent, it's just very rubbish.

36:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's over the top, just asking questions. It's not trying to do you there. So it's like, can we do the onboarding where we help you take your goals, become measures of success, That's a coaching session or there's an immunity to change coaching session. I think they would be the two first coaching sessions.

36:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
We should look at Sorry jones Uh, yeah, I was uh thinking about like the business perspective you mentioned how to present it as a bot which you can show to investors show to whoever as like here's an ai coach that can really coach and From my perspective what I think there is we should minimize the amount of time it takes before you experience coaching if that makes sense like if I have to use the app for a whole week before I can experience it's coaching me that's there's just a lot of Unvariable or variability there that can cause it to go wrong and cause many to like to lose focus so maybe Remember as part of the onboarding,

37:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
you're going to have your first coaching session, which is establishing your goals and your measures and your why. So all that stuff of scheduling, it's a really important point, but unless we've actually got a really good coach, we don't have a product.

37:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so I was thinking for this first iteration of Adapts, probably focusing on day one and getting day one really functional to the point that if you're presenting it to someone, they can go in and use the app on day one and have a really good experience. What does day one mean? Just you install the app, and that's day one, the day one usage of the app.

37:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the whole point. We start with onboarding. And if we can onboard people and get that, that, that's why we've demonstrated that core capability of coaching. Um, but there's no, there's no marketable product there. That's not the scope of phase one.

38:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

38:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, uh, what I meant by weekly, uh, analysis is the coaching can happen every day. But what I meant by weekly analysis is because let's say you were mentored by the agent for a week. And then at the end of the week, there's a notification, a message from the coach, the same message that you said, hey, I've analyzed your behavior. It seems like you're not incorporating a lot of habits or you're not following my guidelines. Let's talk about it. And so when the user opens the app, what will happen is it will try to understand why is it not happening. I think there, the first thing or one of the many things that it can do is ask questions. Is there any particular reason why you were not able to do so? You're now in a coaching session.

39:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, yeah.

39:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it's not just a coaching session. It's like an analysis session of the challenges that the user face.

39:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
That is a coaching session.

39:25 - Chinmay Pandya 
Oh, yes. But it also involves the data from the researchers and the books on habits. And what it leads to. So it can also, that's just the analysis part. What I meant is trading. Like I mean, telling you that if you keep, uh, keep on doing this, your life expense expectancy or your lifespan is going to decrease.

39:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

39:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, that's just the knowledge, the knowledge that the coach has, everything you're saying is right by the way. I just, just want to, I don't think, I think we need to be careful about The language we use, because everything you said there is a coaching session. They're just different aspects. One of them is the history of the customer. The other one is the knowledge of the, of the coaching agent to deliver coaching skills. And then there's the third one, which you talked about, which is the impact. Like, so what if I don't do this? Like you can, like a life coach can just go ask questions. And if you say something, they're not going to go, Hey, if you continue to do this, you're not going to achieve this outcome. So that's a bit that we would want to be adding in based on their goals. Sorry, Will.

40:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

40:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're on mute.

40:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, sorry. So basically, one of our core questions right now is whether we can create a great coach, right, with their product. Do I get it right, Cuan?

40:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Say that again?

41:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, one of our core questions with our Phase whether we are able to provide a great coaching session, right?

41:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct.

41:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. So I would like to ask, and this is probably from someone who's not fit enough, what makes a great coaching session to begin with and how maybe we can start quantifying by that. Is it related to what we've discussed earlier with the murals related to the sleep, to the eating habits? Exercise and whatnot.

41:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, just give me two seconds. I'll come back in a sec. Sorry.

41:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think one of the main goals for our coach agent is, you know, to be able to make the user realize his mistakes or realize the need to, you know, that you have to, you have to incorporate these habits

42:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
and not just, uh, like asking questions, but based on the questions asked and based on the data collected, like we need to hold the user accountable for why he's not doing this. And as a, because, uh, like if you tell a friend that you have started smoking and they're not going to support you, they'll scold you or they'll make you realize why you should not continue.

42:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

42:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I actually agree, but like there's plenty of resistance from that. Oh, nevermind. I'll message it.

42:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's a really, really great question. And that question is an example of a powerful question, which is what makes a coaching session good. A coaching session is just making sure, well, It's the question that gets asked that's called a powerful question that gives the customer some level of awakening or awareness of something new.

43:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where you go, fuck, didn't realize that.

43:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, there's a degree of when you ever start a life coaching session with people, you have something what's called a chemistry session. Because sometimes we've all experienced this, right? You can just get on a phone call with somebody And there's an instant sort of like, oh, I really like that person. There's a good energy connection. And other people, you're just like going, no fucking way. There's nothing wrong with anybody. It's just the chemistry doesn't work. Now, with an AI, that's somewhat difficult. But one of the issues at the moment with AI is it's overly happy and cheery all the fucking time. Like, it's not authentic. It's not real. It doesn't have a personality, like a proper personality. Like, I was, somebody was, I don't know if you've seen this. I'll show it to you. Did you know that all the LLMs have an inability to understand the word strawberry?

44:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

44:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you ask an LLM, how many letter R's are there in the word strawberry, it says two. I think Gemini has now corrected itself, but there's three.

44:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
And when you tell it, no, no, go through it, and it'll go S-T, and it goes, yeah, there's two. You just counted three, but there's two. And then eventually, you can correct it. But the issue is, it doesn't have an opinion. And this is one of the challenges, right? We have to bring some level of sentiment analysis into this so that the client, the bot knows whether it said something wrong and can then take corresponding action, or it said something right and go deeper.

45:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
It has to sense, like it has to have some sense of where the conversation needs to go. And that's why it's, by having an agenda, where if you look at the onboarding, the agenda is to get clear on your goals, convert them to measures of success. Sam, where are you for a second?

45:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
I was going to ask my wife that question.

45:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
The guys are here.

45:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
For you, what makes a good coaching session?

45:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, it sounds silly, adding value, but how do you add value? It's- Who owns the value? Well, one is in the type of questions the coach asks, that they are, that they help someone uncover something they didn't know, they raise awareness, and they also hold that person accountable to make that change. That's pretty much what I said, which is good. Okay, cool. Cool.

46:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so I think we're broadly aligned. It is about that.

46:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
So to reiterate, asking powerful questions to raise awareness and then holding them accountable in that.

46:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, everything we're doing about asking, did you do this? Did you do that? That's accountability.

46:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

46:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we already have that capability. The, the, the questions at the moment, I mean, there's, there's check-in questions. Did you do this thing? Or someone's practically said, they've done that thing. We're doing that. This is more going back to, I think Chinmay's point of view, when they haven't been doing something for a point of time, or they're not engaging with the app, we would then need to do some level of an intervention through a coaching session, which is like, okay.

47:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
you know, there would be a topic, there would be an agenda item for a coaching session. It's like, I'm really struggling to get to the gym. Okay. Let's talk about that. Why is that? I'm really struggling. I found it really easy to give up this thing, but I'm finding it really difficult to give up that thing. I wonder why that is. Let's have a session on it. So generally a coaching session will have a topic. In, in, in life coaching, when we have clients, obviously we haven't spoken to the client in two weeks, so we don't know what they're going to talk about. We would have some initial catch up on how things have been going, but we would know that because they're using the app. And then we would say, well, what do you want to talk about today? What's the most important thing for you?

48:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
You know, I've worked with clients in the past who, who unfortunately they're one of their children had passed away. So. That was a multi-month conversation. That was always the agenda. It was how could they process that, and how could they be with that?

48:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
But specifically, this is around habits. And I think we do need to figure out what a good coaching session is for this onboarding session, because I think it's quite a discrete scope. And if we can demonstrate that, then I think we'll have built some good capability.

48:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I'm hoping you were kissing a person there. No, no, I'm sorry.

48:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Keep going. Cool. So hopefully that's sort of

49:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I feel I've not given you as many answers as I gave you on IntelliAgent, because I think IntelliAgent is way more defined and easier. But hopefully, I think if we can lock the scope down to this, just for the point of understanding, to being that onboarding coaching session, that basically is the same as IntelliAgent. They are one and the same thing. And then all the other stuff around the LMS and the habits and the pension and the modeling, I'm just going to have to build on that over the next couple of days and weeks.

49:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

49:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, to get a line there, what I think, from what you just said, I think we're aligned there. But from what I think, I think the first scope for what we focus on designing and creating should be that onboarding day, the whole onboarding session plus the year-wide coaching session and the day going on, yeah, that day basically.

50:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because that is really what proves the app moving forward, if that makes sense.

50:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, I think that's just what I said. That's not a marketable product.

50:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Absolutely.

50:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
For IntelliAgent it is, but for us it's not.

50:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think one thing I thought about after our previous meeting was how we could combine the UI workshop and the brand purpose workshop. And I think It's a kind of reverse, where the IntelliAgent workshop of URY basically encompasses all of ADAPT instead of the opposite. So the brand purpose workshop has everything that ADAPT will need, with some extras, like double checking the markets and such, that could just be removed. So I think the best way to move forward there is doing the brand purpose workshop in IntelliAgent, and then just shifting it over to ADAPT after that one's done.

51:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Uh, I think, okay. I don't know.

51:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, you can think about it. You send me like a picture or something.

51:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cause I, I need, I need to understand more what that means.

51:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, sure. I'll create a mural after this meeting. If that's okay. Also learn the program.

51:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

51:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey Jimmy.

51:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. So what I wanted to ask was, uh, From the perspective of making the model or the coach more accurate, we are using data like for habits and for sleeping habits, for eating habits. But one more type of the data which I think we need would be the data of coaching sessions. Like the actual coaching sessions turned into scripts. And then we would need those scripts, like so many scripts. And then I think we need to do a little bit of fine tuning for the coach.

52:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
The whole principle of this has been that we will you need to give us the raw capability of having a workshop with some outcomes and having some sort of innate ability to get curious about asking questions. We will then run that workshop multiple times and doing the reinforcement learning on it, saying good response, bad response, do this instead, do that instead. And we will do that. There isn't going to be actual human life coaching sessions that we're going to give you the script because that's not real. The real is an AI to human and that's what we need to get really good.

53:06 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I mean, I get you. But what I meant was in order for the coach to act a certain way. Because what happens is when you create an LLM and you can give it prompts, you can give it examples, you can give it data sources. But it will always act on the basis of how it was trained. So it will always respond in the way that the OpenAI RLM was trained.

53:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
And it can incorporate a certain, you know, good examples, bad examples, but when you say that this was a bad response or when you say that this was a good response, what it does is it just, it will just try to reframe its responses. It will not improve its behavior in terms of it needs to be more curious. It needs to be more...

54:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're talking about, if I say that it's not going to improve its capabilities.

54:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, it's not going to improve its coaching capabilities. It's just going to improve how it's framing its sentences. So to improve its coaching ability, I need predefined coaching session scripts. And I need to train the model on that.

54:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that will create a base. We don't have those, because they'd all be proprietary, and they'd all be human to human, and they'd all be highly confidential. So we wouldn't be able to. They don't exist.

54:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, no, just any, like not real. We can also create, like how you and me had a session. But there needs to be some dummy examples for how the coach needs to behave.

54:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I, so this is, this is a, this is interesting and I agree with you, but I think this potentially is the problem, right? Because I mean, we could probably get books on what it means to be a good life coach or what a good coach is. We could certainly do that with that. Will that help train the agent in terms of what it means to be a coach?

55:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that can help in terms of, you know, we can fine tune the model based on the book, but the model, apart from the fine tuning, it needs examples, like live examples, like you can see the model.

55:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
But how can we, how can we, how can we use the model to create the text, the examples that we then correct the examples and those corrected examples then go back in.

55:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cause like, so let's say me and you have a coaching session, right. And we deem that to be good. And we have that text. There's a person I am coach personally and coach. Yeah. How is that any different to the agent coaching me? And I have a long session with them and I go in and I correct it. I now have personally and coach like, what is the difference between those two things?

56:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
So I'll be very descriptive now. Let's say you ask me a certain question. I'm an AI. I answer you. When you go into the admin panel and you mark it as a bad response, what the LLM gets is that the sentence framing is bad. But let's say you wanted it to behave in four ways. It only behaved in two ways. So because it did not behave the way you wanted it to behave, you cannot give any review that, oh, you should have behaved this way, you should have behaved this way. What you can only do is choose a response and mark it whether it is a good or bad response. Let's say I'm a coach, an AI coach. Let's say the way you're curious is, you ask me four questions, but the AI only asks two questions. So the good response, bad response capability is that you can choose those two responses and tell the bot whether this was a good sentence framing or you know, you can only manipulate the responses which the agent gave. But you also wanted the agent to behave in more ways which it already does. Do you get me? You wanted to incorporate more abilities than it already has.

57:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
So let's say you want the agent to perform. Let me stop for a second. Sorry.

57:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're way more capable than me in terms of the technology. So I'm still trying to play catch up. And I need to leave in a second. Sorry. So we may need to catch up again later today.

58:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
If me and you have a 10-minute coaching session, And we take the transcript of that. There will just be person A and coach having a conversation, right? Is it possible that we can create those transcripts with artificial intelligence? Forget about it. Yeah. So what I'm saying is if you give me a very basic coach capability that is having a conversation with me and I'm then going, don't ask that question, ask this question. Don't ask that. The transcript could be then used to retrain the model. So I will use the screens to get to generate a better transcript. I haven't changed the capability yet, but if we generate loads of those scripts, could that then be used to retrain the model? So that was more, that sounded like a statement, but it's actually a question.

59:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that definitely is a part of retraining the model.

59:04 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay.

59:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, but what I meant was, let's say you want the model to have four abilities, A, B, C and D.

59:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you give an example of an ability? I don't quite get what you mean by abilities.

59:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
like being curious can be an ability asking a particular question can be an ability like let's say uh I think I'm not good at making your discussion that should happen after this meeting or between youtube because this is quite

59:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
an expensive meeting and this is going very much into the technical No, no, this is into the behavior part. This is into the implementation of how to get the behavior. I think we should more be discussing what the behavior should be in this meeting with everyone here, because that's a very AI-specific implementation-like question, if that makes sense.

59:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, but for the implementation, you need data.

1:00:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sure, but I think it happened like in another discussion with Okun later.

1:00:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's absolutely a problem that needs fixing, 100%.

1:00:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:00:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just think we need to figure out how do we fix it given the fact that we do not have hundreds of coaching sessions that we have transcripts for.

1:00:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:00:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
We don't have... I mean, not hundreds, but definitely many.

1:00:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
We don't have... Well, put it this way, we have zero.

1:00:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

1:00:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's the chicken or egg problem. We don't have the transcripts that we needed to train the AI in order for us to... Yeah, we basically don't know where to start. But I think it could be an AI implementation problem.

1:00:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to the data, what specific types of data do you need outside of transcripts?

1:00:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, can you guys have that debate? Hopefully now we understand the concept to focus on. We need to be able to run a good coaching session. I think the coaching session is not dissimilar to a workshop. You're getting curious, you're asking questions, you're responding to those questions until you get to a sense of completeness. So you guys let me know what you need from me. I've obviously got lots more things to do on the whole habit and how all this sort of works.

1:01:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah.

1:01:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, then one thing I want to figure out at least before we end the meeting is what can we work on right now before all the LMS stuff is figured out, before all of that is taken care of because there are are still a lot of questions in the air about how this application should be developed moving forward. I think the most concrete thing we have is the onboarding session, because from how the onboarding session performs, we're going to figure out a lot of other things afterwards.

1:02:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
So I think that's where we should start working, which is where we need to find out the specifics, if that makes sense.

1:02:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, it's not yet a marketable product, sure, since we're still refining a lot of the aspects. But at least now we're not wasting time doing nothing. I think that's a good idea.

1:02:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, because a good outboarding session can define It can help the agent define the psychological aspects of the user, why he has joined the program.

1:02:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:52 - Chinmay Pandya 
So I think if, if the onboarding session is, you know, not accurate. Or not that the onboarding session is the complete marketable product, but the onboarding session is definitely an important part. Because if the results or the insights generated from the onboardings are not accurate, the agent is not going to be able to hold the user accountable when it needs to.

1:03:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So are you guys clear? So what are you taking away from this?

1:03:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
What I have taken away from this in how to move forward is that we should start focusing on planning out and getting properly defined the onboarding session so that we can start on that as fast as possible.

1:03:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or not onboarding session, but onboarding day more so.

1:03:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

1:04:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. To do that, yeah, I'd like a copy of that mural so that I can go into it, go through everything. You said there were quite a few workshops on the first day. Is that correct?

1:04:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just getting the link to the mural.

1:04:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:04:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll put it into Discord. So what did you say there about workshops?

1:04:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
From what I remember, when you showed us the mural, there were a few workshops that happened during the first day. Will there be a few workshops, or only the basic onboarding, getting information, then the getting to know your Y workshop?

1:04:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's the, as part of onboarding, there is just the getting to Y workshop.

1:04:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. That's asynchronous to the other profile bits. That could happen at different times.

1:05:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
But this is all pre the ADAPT program starting.

1:05:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes.

1:05:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need to, sorry. Okay. Um, if you have any questions, which I'm sure there are tons, drop them in and I'll, I'll be back in about an hour and a half. Yeah, absolutely. All right. Thanks guys.

1:05:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah. So what do you guys think?

1:05:39 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I still think that there needs to be a solution for weekly analysis and coaching in certain cases. I agree with that.

1:05:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's a very unclear goal to work on because it's so arbitrary and also it's over a long time span and it's very hard to develop for things that are over a long time span without having something to go root like you use as your roots and then develop from And I think really that onboarding session will be a route where we can expand from much easier than if we start working on some deep analysis. Like if you were to go to a life coach They could never do a session that they do three weeks in with someone with you, because they need to get past the onboarding phase. They need to get to know you. They need to get to know all those things. And even if you just tell them those things by text message or something, they can't do a valuable coaching session on some deep subject that you haven't onboarded onto yet, if that makes sense.

1:06:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
The first thing to be taken care of is the onboarding, but the weekly coaching and the behavioral analysis is something which we didn't add to this course, which needed to be added. That's what I was saying.

1:07:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think it'll be more productive to spend time on figuring out those systems after we have the onboarding session in place, because from that point, we'll have a lot more perspective. We'll be able to see a lot more how the bot reacts just from all the information it gets from onboarding and all that.

1:07:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, I don't think it's too valuable spending too many hours right now on figuring out the week-long system. Yeah, go ahead, Will.

1:07:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Will this be a final product already or we're gonna have phases as well? Like this is phase 1, after this we're gonna reiterate with phase 2, then with phase 3 and such.

1:07:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
For us, phase one will be the onboarding session, but HowCurrency said this phase one is the final product. So it'll be more like, I don't know, some other name, a step, first step for us will be getting the onboarding working. I think really, if we gets a good coaching day where he can use the app and it onboards him and he's engaged, that'll make him really happy. And also he can present that to investors and they can go through that onboarding step and be amazed at what an AI can get them to think about. It's really the same proposition as with IntelliAgent, where we want one coaching session, or for IntelliAgent, one workshop that really amazes the person using it for the first time so that they can get funding and we can build off of that to expand it into more workshops for IntelliAgent and for this one into multiple day ongoing coaching.

1:08:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Got it. Thank you.

1:08:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Anything else?

1:09:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is just my interpretation, by the way. It's from talking with Cuan and also from my development experience of how to not... What's it called? Scope... It's like...

1:09:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Scope creep?

1:09:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, scope creeper, exactly. To avoid scope creep. Often scope creep comes from having too wide of a task to begin with. And not having something to start off from

1:09:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you still here?

1:09:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:09:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Any other questions? Any other insights?

1:09:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nazif, what do you think? You've been here the entire meeting, and I haven't heard anything from you, really.

1:09:52 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yes.

1:09:55 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, I get the idea about onboarding the users and getting to know their UI and make them aware of what they want to achieve to have a better iBit and a better health. I get the general idea, but the technical part, you know, how to implement the stuff is a little fuzzy to me. You know, I don't know if this is because it's really AI related. And there's also the fact that I'm so much busy with OCA.

1:10:39 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah. It's always in my mind.

1:10:42 - Nazif Barassounon 
So I don't know how to switch between the two.

1:10:47 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay.

1:10:48 - Nazif Barassounon 
I think when I will be, when I will wrap up the book project, I will be more free to think about Adapt in a way that is more useful.

1:11:02 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yes, all good.

1:11:03 - Nazif Barassounon 
But I get the general idea, yeah.

1:11:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Hasnain, what do you think?

1:11:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, actually, I think the onboarding session is the main part of the our project because that derives the human personality, like how the human needs to accomplish this task or achieve his goal in the future. And I was thinking like, can we add up like multiple inputs during the onboarding, like I can embed links, I can embed my certification, like I have this type of weightlifting certification, or I have also champion in this football or so it will derive like yeah the levels of the like it will derive the levels of task or exercise the user has achieved till now and the bot needs to think like yes this person has achieve this much level of experience or exercise in that particular field and we have to train or we have to make it more better or achieve it more better.

1:12:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think if you have any sort of like a certification with an exercise or sports or anything like that, this app is probably not for you, if that makes sense. Probably way past the stage. I guess it could be for like if you're a druggie, but you do sports, but I don't think that'll be the main target audience. How to gauge the level of the user will probably be mostly for the basic onboarding session, which is just asking questions like, what are your weight? How tall are you, all of those, to just get a general idea of what stage they are in, rather so than having to upload files. Because if someone has a file that contains their exercise, I think they've probably got their exercise sorted already.

1:13:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:13:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:13:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that's probably it for the meeting, then.

1:13:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, could you stay behind a bit? And then we can sort out your work for me. It's completely unrelated from this meeting. Oh, yeah, Chinmay, go ahead.

1:13:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I think there also needs to be a certain, you know.

1:13:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
You're lagging, Chinmay.

1:14:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello?

1:14:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I don't think you're lagging anymore.

1:14:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is my voice clear?

1:14:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yes, clear now.

1:14:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
So what I was thinking is there needs to be a roadmap generation post-onboarding and pre-usage. Because before the user starts using the app daily, there needs to be a certain roadmap defined. And that roadmap needs to be re-evaluated every week, or the most optimal case is every three weeks. Because ideally, it takes 21 days to adopt some habits.

1:14:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, let's see if you can probably help us now getting more into like technicals and things that are unrelated. It's been great having you on here, though. Have a good day.

1:14:52 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay, have a good day. See you guys tomorrow.

1:14:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
See ya. Yeah, Jemaine has a question. Have you guys ever used like an LAM, a large action model, or implemented one?

1:15:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Not yet. Can you describe it more?

1:15:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
I can't hear you.

1:15:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
It has a name. If Chinmay doesn't catch what I say, could you fill in on it later in Gabby?

1:15:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Has a name?

1:15:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes. Can you derive it more like L-A-N?

1:15:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I will. Can you just describe it to Jonas later if he doesn't catch everything?

1:15:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, can you hear me clearly or is it me that's lagging out?

1:15:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I can hear you.

1:16:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, could you describe it to Jonas later? Yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay, a large action model is a model which, or an LLM, which can perform like a set of actions to complete a task. So for example, I could tell a large action model, hey, book me a ticket to LA from San Francisco, and then it'll go on the web browser browse to the web page, find an appropriate flight and date, and basically do the entire task for you. And how it does that is basically by doing what Chen Mei describes. It creates a roadmap to get to the final destination, and then for each of those sub tasks, each of those tasks on the roadmap, it creates another like sub roadmap, how to achieve that. And that it does before trying to accomplish anything so that it's always staying on track for the like original mission. And I think we'll need to do something like that for, for ADAPT in the long term too, where Do I mean automated bookings? It's not just automated bookings. The point of an LEM is it can do anything related to browsing the internet. You can tell it any tasks and it'll create a roadmap on how to complete that task. For example, automating bookings or Thank you. Signing up for Google or anything. You just tell it to do it and it creates a plan on how to do it and then browses the web until it gets, yeah, by following step-by-step instructions which it itself created. So you have one bot that creates an outline of how to perform a task. And then another model goes through each step by step and tries to perform them. And for each large task, it generates sub-tasks as it browses through and sees the web pages. I think we'll need something like this to stay coherent with the data over a large period of time. Yeah, Hasni? Go ahead. Hasnain sayyed Yeah.

1:18:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
You have mentioned automated booking for the large action model. But in a technical perspective, we need to use the API for the booking website to automate that task. If I'm a human, I can generally type, I want to go from LA to India, and I can book a ticket. But for a system or for AI, it needs to have access to that particular website. So are you talking about like we have an API running at the back end?

1:18:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I mean literally an AI model acting exactly as a human. It's literally going through moving the mouse and clicking buttons and acting as a human browsing the internet. It doesn't need any API keys or anything. The reason I'm bringing this up is just because LAMs are very good proof of concept for how to get a model to cohesively stay on one goal for a long period of time, while being distracted by lots of things. So yeah, as mentioned to an LAM, you can tell it's a complex tasks, like book a ticket, where it will have to figure out how a date picker UI works and all that. And it'll actually go through and like correctly browse the internet as if it were a human by moving a mouse and clicking buttons.

1:19:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

1:19:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the system they use to stay on track is a similar system to what we can use for that. So I think it's valuable if you and Chinmay go and take a look at some large action models, how they're implemented, how they work, and basically try to see if you can take any inspiration from those.

1:19:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, sure. We will explore the large action models.

1:20:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, anything else before we hop off this meeting? I'll just come to you and gather work.

1:20:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, sure. Chinmay, have you shown him the error that we have solved?

1:20:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can probably hop off Google Meets. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll see you guys on the other.

1:20:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

1:20:34 - Hasnain sayyed

Sat, Jul 20, 2024

0:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
but it smells really bad. Okay. Right.

0:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, thing is, most people, right, are living their life eating, making loads of decisions that eventually their system sort of breaks.

0:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it's not like one cigarette doesn't harm you, but smoking for your life does.

0:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
We also know, for example, when you hit 75, wherever you are on your muscle mass, nature falls that off a cliff.

1:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
You can't stop that. But what you can do is choose what level of muscle you have on your body when you are 75. As men, Most men in the world retire at 66.

1:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you think the age is that they die or have a serious medical event that changes their ability to enjoy life?

1:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Personally, I've always heard the figure like 80.

1:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
The data for America says 70.

2:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Wow.

2:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we, we get, we get four years after breaking our balls for 45, 50 years working. Um, but you can change that. Um, the other thing is most people as women, how long do women tend to live after their husbands? Most, most men die way before their wives.

2:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't know.

2:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So women tend to live 15 years longer than men.

2:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
And if you go to a lot of places, certainly in Northern Europe, um, there's a lot of old women. There isn't a lot of old men, just, just the way, the way it is. That's not true in Japan and stuff like that, but in Europe that is. There's a lot of stuff contributing to all of this, which is people's sort of lack of exercise. The food we eat is probably the two biggest ones.

3:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
But there's lots of stuff that we can do. And what we're trying to do with the whole purpose of ADAPT is to start people changing their habits so they get that red line. And in theory, they're going to get healthier. So do you guys know the concept of a pension?

3:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Financially?

3:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. A financial pension.

3:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Basically you give money to an entity so that once you retire, you get an allowance, right?

3:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
A hundred percent. And the younger you start, the better it is for you because it's compound interest over time. I really wish I paid attention more to that when I was younger, but, um, you don't realize that when you're young, you only realize it when you're old. Um, and it's the same for health. So the whole principle of adapt is it's a health pension.

4:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
People don't realize that once you retire, whenever that retirement event is, 66, whatever it is, but you just have age. So you have your 50s, you have your 60s, you have your 70s, you have your 80s.

4:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's stuff that we need to do all the way here because nature will start withdrawing for you. Your lifestyle will start withdrawing for you as you get older. So while we retire and we have a set age financially, let's say we retire at 65 or 66, the health pension is all the time. So nature is withdrawing from you. And you're accelerating that withdrawal if you have a shit lifestyle and eating shit food and not exercising. And so we sort of have refined the ADAPT message a little bit over the last week. We were speaking to an investor last week and he gave us some feedback and it's made us really think about like, what are we? So we're definitely not a weight loss program, even though you would lose weight. I mean, Interestingly, just looking at the call here, nobody on this call needs to lose weight. Everyone's pretty healthy, which is good.

5:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I just want to pause there. Does that sort of make sense that the whole purpose of ADAPT, and it's this concept of paying into a health pension, and that's what we're trying to help people do?

6:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely for me. Anyone else that's confused on that theme?

6:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

6:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Originally, what we had planned was, we had planned this course 10 to reinforce, to predominantly What are you eating, moving, sleep, mind? So there's four areas that you need to do stuff in, in order to, you know, start changing your life.

6:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
And one of the challenges is that, so I signed up before I started ADAPT, I signed up with this guy who helps people reverse something what's called pre-diabetes. Um, and, I had basically achieved in a month what most people take a year to do with him, just because I made a decision and I stuck to it. Most people don't have that diligence. They will do a bit and they do it for a day and I'm like, oh, whatever. So his program's not been very much useful to me because I've done everything. He just says, do this and I've done it. And I don't deviate from that where most people would. So originally where we said, right, eat, move, sleep, mind, And our original market we were going to go after was weight loss, but not being a weight loss program. A lot of weight loss programs, what the data says is that if you're this weight here and you come down to this weight here within a year, 95% of the people will have put on the same weight or more within a year.

8:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the reason is, is that when the goal is weight loss, and you've achieved it, the goal isn't maintenance, it's very tough. So actually what the goal should be is to walk every day, because that never finishes. The goal should be to don't eat seed oils, don't eat processed foods. Those goals will be ever present. And the idea is that we want to slice these habits into way smaller than we've currently been talking to you about. Into these micro habits really really small achievable things Now new problem over my head. What if someone's doing 40 40 habits? We can't do 40 check-ins a day That's gonna fucking piss people off. So I don't have an answer to that by the way Let me to have a think about how the hell we fix that problem. I don't know what it is so The original idea was that we had an LMS That would you would have content allocations to each day of each week, and it's drip fed out, right? So you would have something around eat, move, mind, sleep, and I'll take you through what we think a day looks like,

9:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
So rather than, and I don't have a full answer for this yet, I'm still percolating on it, still trying to figure out the answer.

9:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
We need to figure out a way of for each of these, what are the habits that each of these guys have?

10:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
There may not be the same number in each of them. And I might choose to do different ones to Jonas or Will. We may not all have the same path. The problem with the LMS approach was it was the same path. We're not going to stop the LMS, by the way. I'm just trying to figure out how to reimagine it, what it actually means. I just don't have an answer for it yet. But the idea is that there are some people who are going to move fast and some people who are going to move slow. How do we accommodate both of them? There are some people who are just going to take a habit, do it, take a habit, do it, take a habit, do it. Others are not. And we've got to accommodate both of those worlds. And I don't know how to do that yet. I haven't come up with an answer.

10:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
But fundamentally, the idea is, like a pension, every time you do positive habits, you're paying in. Every time you do something bad, you're taking out. So yesterday, for example, I went to the cinema with my wife, and I had some shit food. I don't do it very often. I do it very rarely. But I had some yesterday so that would be a negative thing but I also did positive things so it was it was overarching a positive day but not as positive as other days. How the hell do we quantify that? Now the challenge with all of this is and I'm we're going to try and maybe speak to a university to try and get someone to help us build a model of is there like a um Do you have something? Do you know flower shops? There's an international flower trade called Interflora.

11:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you want to buy somebody flowers in another country, there's a network called Interflora that allows one florist in one country to speak to another country. This is before the internet, right? Now, all those companies, all florists in the world use a currency called florins. Which basically calibrates them and it protects them from currency fluctuations. So it means if a rose is four florins, it's four florins across the world, it just costs locally a different amount to buy the four florins. It stops trading and currency fluctuations from impacting small businesses basically. So in that same way is like, what is the value of walking for a mile? Or five miles versus having a glass of wine or having a cigarette or not doing something today.

12:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's the value of doing that if you have prediabetes or you're diabetic or you've got heart disease? So the thing is that if each of us here have the same diet, we will all respond differently because our bodies are unique. And there is no, I mean, there's some universal truth like don't smoke, but beyond that, it's very nuanced to the individual in terms of what is truly healthy. Will, you look confused.

13:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, I understand what you're saying. It's just that I'm thinking of it from a technical perspective and I'm, yeah, I'm a bit wondering how the hell can we do that?

13:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Exactly. That's exactly where I'm at as well. I don't believe it's technical. I think this is mathematical at the moment because we have to come up with some form of a weighted model. For example, there's a bullshit. I don't know if you've ever heard of what's called the BMI, which is your body mass index. It's horseshit because most rugby players would be considered obese by the manufacturer. But for the average person, it's sort of indicative. It's sort of okay. So what we need to be, and this is the challenge, we need to be roughly right rather than precisely wrong. So we're going to have a subjective point of view on this, and we're going to have to try and get some independent body to create the weighting or the maths model around this, that a glass of wine is a unit and whatever that unit happens to be. And then if you do walks, that equates to some other unit. So there will be some, some sort of handshake, I don't know what it is yet. Yeah, Jonas?

14:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
From that to me, I'd be a bit afraid of users like excusing a cup of wine or like indulging in bad habits because they do something else. If that makes sense, they create bad habits because they excuse it with like, oh, it's only this amount of points or whatever.

14:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

14:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
That is, Well, I mean, that's sort of what I rationalized yesterday, isn't it?

15:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

15:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
But that's a one-time thing, what you did. But if someone starts a habit, starts a small bad thing every day because they're doing this bad walking routine, that's so much better. This isn't a commentary on the implementation or anything. I'm just wondering what you think about it.

15:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think it's a risk. I think it's also...

15:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
At the end of the day, people can lie about what they're doing as well.

15:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is, for want of a better basis, this is a game. This is not medical advice. This is supposed to help you. And yeah, we're going to have to go and get some legal advice in terms of how are we exposing ourselves legally by even suggesting some of these things to people. But we'll figure that out over time. But yes, the idea is that What people don't realize is that the majority of their diets are actually desserts. It's all basically carbs and sugar. And then they have one thing at the end of the day called dessert. It's like, no, no, no. Every single meal you've had is a dessert. And so there's a huge re-education piece to help people, you know, right the shit. So if I was to look at this sort of technically now for a moment, and I'll share my screen.

16:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so we have, I'm just trying to figure out, where is it?

16:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Nope.

16:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I've got a load of old stuff here. I'm just wanna make sure I don't wanna bother. I don't think you need to see that.

17:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right, okay, right, okay.

17:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just going to write some stuff out here.

18:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I'll be with you in two seconds, guys.

18:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me know when you can see that. Can you see this?

19:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you guys see it, yeah?

19:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yep, I can see it. Sorry, it wasn't me.

19:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it starts with awareness. So this could be social media campaign, paid for advertising, whatever it is. Someone becomes aware that Adapt exists. They will then sign up where we would capture an email on a newsletter. So this already exists today. What doesn't exist is the ability for them to then register. And register is just payment.

19:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
We would then start agent onboarding. So we want the agent to onboard them rather than filling in forms and stuff like that. We wanted to educate them that there is an agent that's capable of doing these things and owns a relationship. An agent onboarding has the sense of profile field. So do you drink coffee? What's your date of birth? Blah, blah, blah. Whatever fields we find important. And then there's the first sort of coaching session. It's about clarifying your why and your goals. So when things get tough and people find this difficult, it's going to be the why they're doing this is going to help them stay motivated and stay on course.

20:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is the fuel that keeps them applying healthier habits as opposed to The goal is what they're achieving. So a lot of people will say, I want to lose weight. They think that's the goal. We will shift their mindset to say that losing weight is a measure. The goal is to stick to healthy habits. That's, what's got to be the goal.

20:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the why is going to be there. Why supportive with some education around the, like a lot of what I said at the start there about what happens in the future, like when you're older and that this healthy pension stuff. So that's, what's that going to be. So. We would then explain why this is important. So that's similar to the IntelliAgent contact setting. That's all that is. So I can change that now. So that's context setting.

21:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Explain.

21:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, if we say to them, what are your goals? They might have something measurable, tangible, like I want to lose weight. I want to fit into this dress size. It's very clear. We need to, we need to iterate on that with them as coaches to get very, very clear on what that goal is. And it has smart attributes. Have you ever heard of smart goals?

21:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's just a measurable, specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. So they're just qualities of what a goal is. Um, And the idea is that we would shift them that their goal is most likely a measure of success as opposed to the goal.

22:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if it's weight loss, the weight loss is your measure of success. It's not the goal. The goal is the habits every day. And then we go establishing the why, lock it in deep. This is going deep onto their emotions, what they want to feel. So Chinmay, we talked about this when we worked through the session with you. So that sort of helped you understand this. And then we're trying to figure out whether we do this bit. We don't know whether we start talking about the obstacles and what's going to get in their way of doing this. We're not 100% sure, but I think we will. I'm going to leave it orange for now. Now, if someone doesn't have any goals, We need to help them. The yellows are coaching sessions, by the way. We need to help establishing their goals. This is the legacy concept of a goal, like losing weight. It'll be something tangible, which we will then turn that into their measure of success. If they have lots of goals, we'll need to prioritize them and pick out one, because having too many doesn't make sense. And so it could be, you know, Sleep time, I want to sleep eight hours a day. It could be my timetable, gym. There's different sessions. So that will be the end of the onboarding. And then the idea is that on a, and this is actually, I don't know if I'm going to show this section because, and the reason I want to pause for a second and I welcomed the conversation now. Hello puppy. My dog's just come in to say hello. Hello. You okay?

23:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
What was its name?

23:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Shelby. Come here, baby. Come on. Shelby.

23:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Come on.

23:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Up.

23:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Come on up. I know you're tired. Come on up. Up. Say hello. Come on. There we go.

23:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hi.

23:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
He was...

24:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

24:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're going back there. You're sleepy. Yeah, I'm still sleepy. She's only just woken up. She wants me to take her for a walk.

24:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the reason why I paused those mobile screens there was that that was sort of predicated on a known daily content being sent to you by an agent because you're doing a 10-week program and what happens on every day is the same regardless of the person.

24:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not saying we don't do that, by the way, but I don't want to presume that's what we do. I think I want to have a week to play with my head and figure out what we're actually going to do. Because the principle now is across eat, move, mind, and sleep, there's going to be a load of micro habits Like one habit might be, if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it.

25:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
If it's got an ingredient you can't pronounce, don't eat it.

25:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you didn't make it, don't eat it. If your grandmother wouldn't have made it, don't eat it. So they're not really habits that you do every day. They're sort of guiding principles, which are sort of habits. But this is my point. I could be very concerned that very quickly, if you're tracking these every day, Like imagine if you make a thousand pounds contribution to your pension, you don't ask, did you put that pound in? Did you put that pound in? Did you put that? You don't, you don't ask a thousand times. You just say, well, it's a thousand pounds. You did all of it. So it's going to be a lot easier from a financial point of view. I don't know how we're going to do it for this. Cause this only really happened in the last three or four days, this sort of clarification of, of habits and stacking. So, um, The idea will be, is there still going to be content to help you when you take on a new habit? It will unlock some content. And whether we go, it's always incremental habits. And maybe once a week, there's a check-in. You have a habit dashboard. Are you doing all of these? Are you not doing all of these? Don't know. Because again, we don't want it to be overwhelming for people.

26:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I used to have a weight tracking app a year ago or two when I was doing a diet. That weight loss app, no, a weight tracker app had a pretty similar feature where it had like three tabs at the bottom, it was just BMI, which I didn't care about, the tracker, where I just entered every day and it gave me a graph, and a habit section, which is pretty similar to what you're describing. It was focused on establishing good small habits, but it didn't really, it was very simple. It had just a grid layout of just don't leave before you sleep, run 10 minutes a day and such. When you activated one of them, it just gave you like a checkbox for each day in the month. And you just, whenever you opened the app on a day, since I tracked every day in the morning, it also gave me the checkbox. Did you do this today? I just clicked, but it didn't work well for me.

27:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
It didn't really help. So why, why, why did you think it doesn't help?

27:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
There was no real pull through. It was kind of just a checkbox each day. There was nothing to consult about. It was just don't eat before bed. And that's a decision I can make independently of clicking the checkbox each day, if that makes sense.

28:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

28:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's more if I didn't do it, then I'd want to go in and say, hey, I didn't do it. But I'm not sure. That's something a heart is told.

28:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, I've not heard that word, parasocial.

28:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry?

28:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
You asked a question there and I don't understand the question. Sorry. I don't know what a parasocial relationship is.

28:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, okay. Basically, it's a common term in streaming culture wherein you develop a social relationship with an entity that doesn't really Oh yeah, basically you develop a relationship with an entity. So what I was thinking about is maybe instead of like a weekly tracker or whatnot, we turn the AI trainer into a friend or a consultant type.

29:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, there's a whole business around AI girlfriends. So I think people forming relationships with entities, I don't think that's the issue. But one of the things I've just realized, There's two main work streams here.

29:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
One is the habits and what we're doing there. The reality is that people, one of our assumptions is, people will be given information and totally believe that if I do this thing, it's good for me. And yet I will do this thing.

29:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, at some point, that behavior becomes a problem. I know this is good for me, but yet I do this. When you're 20, doesn't really fucking matter because you've got so much time in your body so fast, it's able to get over all this stuff, but at a point it becomes a problem. And so people have, this is the second part of the coaching. And the most important part of the coaching is helping people understand why are they doing this bad behavior? Because it's serving them at some level. Maybe it reminds them of something, defiance against their father, or I don't know, there's all of this deep rooted stuff that we're not aware of But until you get connected to that and you let go of it, you can't do the new behavior.

30:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I got that medical advice that if I didn't change what I was doing, I was probably gonna have a heart episode and probably die within five years. So I was highly motivated to do that. But I've noticed probably in the last month, I have let go the very rigorous approach that I was doing. So I'm in more of a maintenance mode now. And I think it's important that we understand that when we do things that are not helpful to us, why do we not do that? And there is this framework around the immunity to change, which is a video that we shared previously. It's a framework of these five steps and going. It's helping people do that. So we are having this assumption that coaching people will actually help them understand their bad behavior so they can start doing the good behavior.

31:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
So do you get that? So there's the one part is content. Here are good habits to do and tracking them. However, we decide to do that. The most important part is People probably won't do the good things for them, and helping them understand why, and through coaching, unlocking that, using specifically the immunity to change framework.

31:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
HMI.

31:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
Hi, so what I was thinking was you know for like there's no way to you know measure each and everything like with the pension formula that you mentioned there's no way to measure things like statically like everything has to be dynamic and we cannot define like we cannot have predefined measures like what a glass of wine could be like you said it could be Non-harmful for somebody, but it could be harmful for somebody. So a solution is that we have, I, what I think is at the end of each week, uh, like the data is calculated every day, right? The data is fetched. The data is collected and stored in the database every day. And using the data of six days or six and a half days at the tech on the seventh day, there needs to be a behavioral analysis. Of which habits did the user like, is he trying to put in those habits? Is he trying to make efforts or is he failing to do so?

33:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't disagree with you. However, if I look at this as a, as a company, right. And I'm going to go to somebody and say, Hey, give us a million quid. Because we want to go really big, and we want to go do marketing, and blah, blah, whatever. The thing that's most unique here is the ability to coach somebody.

33:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because otherwise, you're just pushing content in a different type of window, and we've got some form of a model that gives you a nice indicator or something. Loads of people are going, did you do that? Did you do that? Reminders, Apple's got reminders, you know, stuff like that.

33:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

33:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I'm most interested in is can we create a bot that actually coaches like really coaches you?

34:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. I mean, uh, that's what I was pointing out because for each individual user, if you want to coach him the way he is or she is, you need data on the user. So if we have. Data on the user's activities. Let's say we have a week's data for the user's activities. You can Analyze the user's behavior. You can create a behavior analysis You can match that with the onboarding data what the user's goal were what psychology psychological reasons were for why he wants to You know why he wants to make progress why he signed up for this Course and you can also I think what something external from the technical point of view, which we need is. Uh, like data from research from habit, like there's research on people's habits, like there's, uh, research from psychologists, the research research data from therapists. I think that's what we need, uh, at, and I think that would be too.

35:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
too much computation if we do it every day. That's why I proposed every week.

35:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, so I think what you're speaking to is what I agree with is the, like at some point the system needs to observe that someone's not doing good things. And then you'd say, Hey, listen, we need to have a coaching session. It's probably going to be an hour. So when can we schedule that? And then we, we, we have all of the context of what they've been doing in order to run that session.

35:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's aspect one. The innate ability to do the coaching is what I'm talking about, regardless of when you schedule it or stuff like that. The actual ability, if you look at Thrive AI, the one I sent, it's just very rubbish.

36:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's over the top, just asking questions. It's not trying to do you there. So it's like, can we do the onboarding where we help you take your goals, become measures of success, That's a coaching session or there's an immunity to change coaching session. I think they would be the two first coaching sessions.

36:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
We should look at Sorry jones Uh, yeah, I was uh thinking about like the business perspective you mentioned how to present it as a bot which you can show to investors show to whoever as like here's an ai coach that can really coach and From my perspective what I think there is we should minimize the amount of time it takes before you experience coaching if that makes sense like if I have to use the app for a whole week before I can experience it's coaching me that's there's just a lot of Unvariable or variability there that can cause it to go wrong and cause many to like to lose focus so maybe Remember as part of the onboarding,

37:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
you're going to have your first coaching session, which is establishing your goals and your measures and your why. So all that stuff of scheduling, it's a really important point, but unless we've actually got a really good coach, we don't have a product.

37:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so I was thinking for this first iteration of Adapts, probably focusing on day one and getting day one really functional to the point that if you're presenting it to someone, they can go in and use the app on day one and have a really good experience. What does day one mean? Just you install the app, and that's day one, the day one usage of the app.

37:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the whole point. We start with onboarding. And if we can onboard people and get that, that, that's why we've demonstrated that core capability of coaching. Um, but there's no, there's no marketable product there. That's not the scope of phase one.

38:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

38:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, uh, what I meant by weekly, uh, analysis is the coaching can happen every day. But what I meant by weekly analysis is because let's say you were mentored by the agent for a week. And then at the end of the week, there's a notification, a message from the coach, the same message that you said, hey, I've analyzed your behavior. It seems like you're not incorporating a lot of habits or you're not following my guidelines. Let's talk about it. And so when the user opens the app, what will happen is it will try to understand why is it not happening. I think there, the first thing or one of the many things that it can do is ask questions. Is there any particular reason why you were not able to do so? You're now in a coaching session.

39:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, yeah.

39:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it's not just a coaching session. It's like an analysis session of the challenges that the user face.

39:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
That is a coaching session.

39:25 - Chinmay Pandya 
Oh, yes. But it also involves the data from the researchers and the books on habits. And what it leads to. So it can also, that's just the analysis part. What I meant is trading. Like I mean, telling you that if you keep, uh, keep on doing this, your life expense expectancy or your lifespan is going to decrease.

39:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

39:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, that's just the knowledge, the knowledge that the coach has, everything you're saying is right by the way. I just, just want to, I don't think, I think we need to be careful about The language we use, because everything you said there is a coaching session. They're just different aspects. One of them is the history of the customer. The other one is the knowledge of the, of the coaching agent to deliver coaching skills. And then there's the third one, which you talked about, which is the impact. Like, so what if I don't do this? Like you can, like a life coach can just go ask questions. And if you say something, they're not going to go, Hey, if you continue to do this, you're not going to achieve this outcome. So that's a bit that we would want to be adding in based on their goals. Sorry, Will.

40:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

40:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're on mute.

40:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, sorry. So basically, one of our core questions right now is whether we can create a great coach, right, with their product. Do I get it right, Cuan?

40:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Say that again?

41:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, one of our core questions with our Phase whether we are able to provide a great coaching session, right?

41:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct.

41:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. So I would like to ask, and this is probably from someone who's not fit enough, what makes a great coaching session to begin with and how maybe we can start quantifying by that. Is it related to what we've discussed earlier with the murals related to the sleep, to the eating habits? Exercise and whatnot.

41:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, just give me two seconds. I'll come back in a sec. Sorry.

41:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think one of the main goals for our coach agent is, you know, to be able to make the user realize his mistakes or realize the need to, you know, that you have to, you have to incorporate these habits

42:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
and not just, uh, like asking questions, but based on the questions asked and based on the data collected, like we need to hold the user accountable for why he's not doing this. And as a, because, uh, like if you tell a friend that you have started smoking and they're not going to support you, they'll scold you or they'll make you realize why you should not continue.

42:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

42:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I actually agree, but like there's plenty of resistance from that. Oh, nevermind. I'll message it.

42:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's a really, really great question. And that question is an example of a powerful question, which is what makes a coaching session good. A coaching session is just making sure, well, It's the question that gets asked that's called a powerful question that gives the customer some level of awakening or awareness of something new.

43:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where you go, fuck, didn't realize that.

43:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, there's a degree of when you ever start a life coaching session with people, you have something what's called a chemistry session. Because sometimes we've all experienced this, right? You can just get on a phone call with somebody And there's an instant sort of like, oh, I really like that person. There's a good energy connection. And other people, you're just like going, no fucking way. There's nothing wrong with anybody. It's just the chemistry doesn't work. Now, with an AI, that's somewhat difficult. But one of the issues at the moment with AI is it's overly happy and cheery all the fucking time. Like, it's not authentic. It's not real. It doesn't have a personality, like a proper personality. Like, I was, somebody was, I don't know if you've seen this. I'll show it to you. Did you know that all the LLMs have an inability to understand the word strawberry?

44:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

44:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you ask an LLM, how many letter R's are there in the word strawberry, it says two. I think Gemini has now corrected itself, but there's three.

44:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
And when you tell it, no, no, go through it, and it'll go S-T, and it goes, yeah, there's two. You just counted three, but there's two. And then eventually, you can correct it. But the issue is, it doesn't have an opinion. And this is one of the challenges, right? We have to bring some level of sentiment analysis into this so that the client, the bot knows whether it said something wrong and can then take corresponding action, or it said something right and go deeper.

45:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
It has to sense, like it has to have some sense of where the conversation needs to go. And that's why it's, by having an agenda, where if you look at the onboarding, the agenda is to get clear on your goals, convert them to measures of success. Sam, where are you for a second?

45:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
I was going to ask my wife that question.

45:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
The guys are here.

45:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
For you, what makes a good coaching session?

45:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, it sounds silly, adding value, but how do you add value? It's- Who owns the value? Well, one is in the type of questions the coach asks, that they are, that they help someone uncover something they didn't know, they raise awareness, and they also hold that person accountable to make that change. That's pretty much what I said, which is good. Okay, cool. Cool.

46:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so I think we're broadly aligned. It is about that.

46:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
So to reiterate, asking powerful questions to raise awareness and then holding them accountable in that.

46:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, everything we're doing about asking, did you do this? Did you do that? That's accountability.

46:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

46:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we already have that capability. The, the, the questions at the moment, I mean, there's, there's check-in questions. Did you do this thing? Or someone's practically said, they've done that thing. We're doing that. This is more going back to, I think Chinmay's point of view, when they haven't been doing something for a point of time, or they're not engaging with the app, we would then need to do some level of an intervention through a coaching session, which is like, okay.

47:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
you know, there would be a topic, there would be an agenda item for a coaching session. It's like, I'm really struggling to get to the gym. Okay. Let's talk about that. Why is that? I'm really struggling. I found it really easy to give up this thing, but I'm finding it really difficult to give up that thing. I wonder why that is. Let's have a session on it. So generally a coaching session will have a topic. In, in, in life coaching, when we have clients, obviously we haven't spoken to the client in two weeks, so we don't know what they're going to talk about. We would have some initial catch up on how things have been going, but we would know that because they're using the app. And then we would say, well, what do you want to talk about today? What's the most important thing for you?

48:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
You know, I've worked with clients in the past who, who unfortunately they're one of their children had passed away. So. That was a multi-month conversation. That was always the agenda. It was how could they process that, and how could they be with that?

48:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
But specifically, this is around habits. And I think we do need to figure out what a good coaching session is for this onboarding session, because I think it's quite a discrete scope. And if we can demonstrate that, then I think we'll have built some good capability.

48:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I'm hoping you were kissing a person there. No, no, I'm sorry.

48:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Keep going. Cool. So hopefully that's sort of

49:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I feel I've not given you as many answers as I gave you on IntelliAgent, because I think IntelliAgent is way more defined and easier. But hopefully, I think if we can lock the scope down to this, just for the point of understanding, to being that onboarding coaching session, that basically is the same as IntelliAgent. They are one and the same thing. And then all the other stuff around the LMS and the habits and the pension and the modeling, I'm just going to have to build on that over the next couple of days and weeks.

49:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

49:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, to get a line there, what I think, from what you just said, I think we're aligned there. But from what I think, I think the first scope for what we focus on designing and creating should be that onboarding day, the whole onboarding session plus the year-wide coaching session and the day going on, yeah, that day basically.

50:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because that is really what proves the app moving forward, if that makes sense.

50:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, I think that's just what I said. That's not a marketable product.

50:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Absolutely.

50:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
For IntelliAgent it is, but for us it's not.

50:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think one thing I thought about after our previous meeting was how we could combine the UI workshop and the brand purpose workshop. And I think It's a kind of reverse, where the IntelliAgent workshop of URY basically encompasses all of ADAPT instead of the opposite. So the brand purpose workshop has everything that ADAPT will need, with some extras, like double checking the markets and such, that could just be removed. So I think the best way to move forward there is doing the brand purpose workshop in IntelliAgent, and then just shifting it over to ADAPT after that one's done.

51:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Uh, I think, okay. I don't know.

51:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, you can think about it. You send me like a picture or something.

51:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cause I, I need, I need to understand more what that means.

51:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, sure. I'll create a mural after this meeting. If that's okay. Also learn the program.

51:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

51:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey Jimmy.

51:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. So what I wanted to ask was, uh, From the perspective of making the model or the coach more accurate, we are using data like for habits and for sleeping habits, for eating habits. But one more type of the data which I think we need would be the data of coaching sessions. Like the actual coaching sessions turned into scripts. And then we would need those scripts, like so many scripts. And then I think we need to do a little bit of fine tuning for the coach.

52:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
The whole principle of this has been that we will you need to give us the raw capability of having a workshop with some outcomes and having some sort of innate ability to get curious about asking questions. We will then run that workshop multiple times and doing the reinforcement learning on it, saying good response, bad response, do this instead, do that instead. And we will do that. There isn't going to be actual human life coaching sessions that we're going to give you the script because that's not real. The real is an AI to human and that's what we need to get really good.

53:06 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I mean, I get you. But what I meant was in order for the coach to act a certain way. Because what happens is when you create an LLM and you can give it prompts, you can give it examples, you can give it data sources. But it will always act on the basis of how it was trained. So it will always respond in the way that the OpenAI RLM was trained.

53:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
And it can incorporate a certain, you know, good examples, bad examples, but when you say that this was a bad response or when you say that this was a good response, what it does is it just, it will just try to reframe its responses. It will not improve its behavior in terms of it needs to be more curious. It needs to be more...

54:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're talking about, if I say that it's not going to improve its capabilities.

54:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, it's not going to improve its coaching capabilities. It's just going to improve how it's framing its sentences. So to improve its coaching ability, I need predefined coaching session scripts. And I need to train the model on that.

54:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that will create a base. We don't have those, because they'd all be proprietary, and they'd all be human to human, and they'd all be highly confidential. So we wouldn't be able to. They don't exist.

54:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, no, just any, like not real. We can also create, like how you and me had a session. But there needs to be some dummy examples for how the coach needs to behave.

54:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I, so this is, this is a, this is interesting and I agree with you, but I think this potentially is the problem, right? Because I mean, we could probably get books on what it means to be a good life coach or what a good coach is. We could certainly do that with that. Will that help train the agent in terms of what it means to be a coach?

55:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that can help in terms of, you know, we can fine tune the model based on the book, but the model, apart from the fine tuning, it needs examples, like live examples, like you can see the model.

55:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
But how can we, how can we, how can we use the model to create the text, the examples that we then correct the examples and those corrected examples then go back in.

55:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cause like, so let's say me and you have a coaching session, right. And we deem that to be good. And we have that text. There's a person I am coach personally and coach. Yeah. How is that any different to the agent coaching me? And I have a long session with them and I go in and I correct it. I now have personally and coach like, what is the difference between those two things?

56:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
So I'll be very descriptive now. Let's say you ask me a certain question. I'm an AI. I answer you. When you go into the admin panel and you mark it as a bad response, what the LLM gets is that the sentence framing is bad. But let's say you wanted it to behave in four ways. It only behaved in two ways. So because it did not behave the way you wanted it to behave, you cannot give any review that, oh, you should have behaved this way, you should have behaved this way. What you can only do is choose a response and mark it whether it is a good or bad response. Let's say I'm a coach, an AI coach. Let's say the way you're curious is, you ask me four questions, but the AI only asks two questions. So the good response, bad response capability is that you can choose those two responses and tell the bot whether this was a good sentence framing or you know, you can only manipulate the responses which the agent gave. But you also wanted the agent to behave in more ways which it already does. Do you get me? You wanted to incorporate more abilities than it already has.

57:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
So let's say you want the agent to perform. Let me stop for a second. Sorry.

57:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're way more capable than me in terms of the technology. So I'm still trying to play catch up. And I need to leave in a second. Sorry. So we may need to catch up again later today.

58:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
If me and you have a 10-minute coaching session, And we take the transcript of that. There will just be person A and coach having a conversation, right? Is it possible that we can create those transcripts with artificial intelligence? Forget about it. Yeah. So what I'm saying is if you give me a very basic coach capability that is having a conversation with me and I'm then going, don't ask that question, ask this question. Don't ask that. The transcript could be then used to retrain the model. So I will use the screens to get to generate a better transcript. I haven't changed the capability yet, but if we generate loads of those scripts, could that then be used to retrain the model? So that was more, that sounded like a statement, but it's actually a question.

59:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that definitely is a part of retraining the model.

59:04 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay.

59:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, but what I meant was, let's say you want the model to have four abilities, A, B, C and D.

59:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you give an example of an ability? I don't quite get what you mean by abilities.

59:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
like being curious can be an ability asking a particular question can be an ability like let's say uh I think I'm not good at making your discussion that should happen after this meeting or between youtube because this is quite

59:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
an expensive meeting and this is going very much into the technical No, no, this is into the behavior part. This is into the implementation of how to get the behavior. I think we should more be discussing what the behavior should be in this meeting with everyone here, because that's a very AI-specific implementation-like question, if that makes sense.

59:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, but for the implementation, you need data.

1:00:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sure, but I think it happened like in another discussion with Okun later.

1:00:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's absolutely a problem that needs fixing, 100%.

1:00:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:00:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just think we need to figure out how do we fix it given the fact that we do not have hundreds of coaching sessions that we have transcripts for.

1:00:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:00:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
We don't have... I mean, not hundreds, but definitely many.

1:00:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
We don't have... Well, put it this way, we have zero.

1:00:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

1:00:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's the chicken or egg problem. We don't have the transcripts that we needed to train the AI in order for us to... Yeah, we basically don't know where to start. But I think it could be an AI implementation problem.

1:00:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to the data, what specific types of data do you need outside of transcripts?

1:00:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, can you guys have that debate? Hopefully now we understand the concept to focus on. We need to be able to run a good coaching session. I think the coaching session is not dissimilar to a workshop. You're getting curious, you're asking questions, you're responding to those questions until you get to a sense of completeness. So you guys let me know what you need from me. I've obviously got lots more things to do on the whole habit and how all this sort of works.

1:01:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah.

1:01:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, then one thing I want to figure out at least before we end the meeting is what can we work on right now before all the LMS stuff is figured out, before all of that is taken care of because there are are still a lot of questions in the air about how this application should be developed moving forward. I think the most concrete thing we have is the onboarding session, because from how the onboarding session performs, we're going to figure out a lot of other things afterwards.

1:02:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
So I think that's where we should start working, which is where we need to find out the specifics, if that makes sense.

1:02:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, it's not yet a marketable product, sure, since we're still refining a lot of the aspects. But at least now we're not wasting time doing nothing. I think that's a good idea.

1:02:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, because a good outboarding session can define It can help the agent define the psychological aspects of the user, why he has joined the program.

1:02:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:52 - Chinmay Pandya 
So I think if, if the onboarding session is, you know, not accurate. Or not that the onboarding session is the complete marketable product, but the onboarding session is definitely an important part. Because if the results or the insights generated from the onboardings are not accurate, the agent is not going to be able to hold the user accountable when it needs to.

1:03:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So are you guys clear? So what are you taking away from this?

1:03:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
What I have taken away from this in how to move forward is that we should start focusing on planning out and getting properly defined the onboarding session so that we can start on that as fast as possible.

1:03:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or not onboarding session, but onboarding day more so.

1:03:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

1:04:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. To do that, yeah, I'd like a copy of that mural so that I can go into it, go through everything. You said there were quite a few workshops on the first day. Is that correct?

1:04:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just getting the link to the mural.

1:04:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:04:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll put it into Discord. So what did you say there about workshops?

1:04:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
From what I remember, when you showed us the mural, there were a few workshops that happened during the first day. Will there be a few workshops, or only the basic onboarding, getting information, then the getting to know your Y workshop?

1:04:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's the, as part of onboarding, there is just the getting to Y workshop.

1:04:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. That's asynchronous to the other profile bits. That could happen at different times.

1:05:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
But this is all pre the ADAPT program starting.

1:05:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes.

1:05:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need to, sorry. Okay. Um, if you have any questions, which I'm sure there are tons, drop them in and I'll, I'll be back in about an hour and a half. Yeah, absolutely. All right. Thanks guys.

1:05:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah. So what do you guys think?

1:05:39 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I still think that there needs to be a solution for weekly analysis and coaching in certain cases. I agree with that.

1:05:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's a very unclear goal to work on because it's so arbitrary and also it's over a long time span and it's very hard to develop for things that are over a long time span without having something to go root like you use as your roots and then develop from And I think really that onboarding session will be a route where we can expand from much easier than if we start working on some deep analysis. Like if you were to go to a life coach They could never do a session that they do three weeks in with someone with you, because they need to get past the onboarding phase. They need to get to know you. They need to get to know all those things. And even if you just tell them those things by text message or something, they can't do a valuable coaching session on some deep subject that you haven't onboarded onto yet, if that makes sense.

1:06:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
The first thing to be taken care of is the onboarding, but the weekly coaching and the behavioral analysis is something which we didn't add to this course, which needed to be added. That's what I was saying.

1:07:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think it'll be more productive to spend time on figuring out those systems after we have the onboarding session in place, because from that point, we'll have a lot more perspective. We'll be able to see a lot more how the bot reacts just from all the information it gets from onboarding and all that.

1:07:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, I don't think it's too valuable spending too many hours right now on figuring out the week-long system. Yeah, go ahead, Will.

1:07:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Will this be a final product already or we're gonna have phases as well? Like this is phase 1, after this we're gonna reiterate with phase 2, then with phase 3 and such.

1:07:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
For us, phase one will be the onboarding session, but HowCurrency said this phase one is the final product. So it'll be more like, I don't know, some other name, a step, first step for us will be getting the onboarding working. I think really, if we gets a good coaching day where he can use the app and it onboards him and he's engaged, that'll make him really happy. And also he can present that to investors and they can go through that onboarding step and be amazed at what an AI can get them to think about. It's really the same proposition as with IntelliAgent, where we want one coaching session, or for IntelliAgent, one workshop that really amazes the person using it for the first time so that they can get funding and we can build off of that to expand it into more workshops for IntelliAgent and for this one into multiple day ongoing coaching.

1:08:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Got it. Thank you.

1:08:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Anything else?

1:09:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is just my interpretation, by the way. It's from talking with Cuan and also from my development experience of how to not... What's it called? Scope... It's like...

1:09:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Scope creep?

1:09:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, scope creeper, exactly. To avoid scope creep. Often scope creep comes from having too wide of a task to begin with. And not having something to start off from

1:09:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you still here?

1:09:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:09:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Any other questions? Any other insights?

1:09:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nazif, what do you think? You've been here the entire meeting, and I haven't heard anything from you, really.

1:09:52 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yes.

1:09:55 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, I get the idea about onboarding the users and getting to know their UI and make them aware of what they want to achieve to have a better iBit and a better health. I get the general idea, but the technical part, you know, how to implement the stuff is a little fuzzy to me. You know, I don't know if this is because it's really AI related. And there's also the fact that I'm so much busy with OCA.

1:10:39 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah. It's always in my mind.

1:10:42 - Nazif Barassounon 
So I don't know how to switch between the two.

1:10:47 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay.

1:10:48 - Nazif Barassounon 
I think when I will be, when I will wrap up the book project, I will be more free to think about Adapt in a way that is more useful.

1:11:02 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yes, all good.

1:11:03 - Nazif Barassounon 
But I get the general idea, yeah.

1:11:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Hasnain, what do you think?

1:11:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, actually, I think the onboarding session is the main part of the our project because that derives the human personality, like how the human needs to accomplish this task or achieve his goal in the future. And I was thinking like, can we add up like multiple inputs during the onboarding, like I can embed links, I can embed my certification, like I have this type of weightlifting certification, or I have also champion in this football or so it will derive like yeah the levels of the like it will derive the levels of task or exercise the user has achieved till now and the bot needs to think like yes this person has achieve this much level of experience or exercise in that particular field and we have to train or we have to make it more better or achieve it more better.

1:12:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think if you have any sort of like a certification with an exercise or sports or anything like that, this app is probably not for you, if that makes sense. Probably way past the stage. I guess it could be for like if you're a druggie, but you do sports, but I don't think that'll be the main target audience. How to gauge the level of the user will probably be mostly for the basic onboarding session, which is just asking questions like, what are your weight? How tall are you, all of those, to just get a general idea of what stage they are in, rather so than having to upload files. Because if someone has a file that contains their exercise, I think they've probably got their exercise sorted already.

1:13:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:13:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:13:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that's probably it for the meeting, then.

1:13:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, could you stay behind a bit? And then we can sort out your work for me. It's completely unrelated from this meeting. Oh, yeah, Chinmay, go ahead.

1:13:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I think there also needs to be a certain, you know.

1:13:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
You're lagging, Chinmay.

1:14:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello?

1:14:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I don't think you're lagging anymore.

1:14:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is my voice clear?

1:14:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yes, clear now.

1:14:16 - Chinmay Pandya 
So what I was thinking is there needs to be a roadmap generation post-onboarding and pre-usage. Because before the user starts using the app daily, there needs to be a certain roadmap defined. And that roadmap needs to be re-evaluated every week, or the most optimal case is every three weeks. Because ideally, it takes 21 days to adopt some habits.

1:14:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, let's see if you can probably help us now getting more into like technicals and things that are unrelated. It's been great having you on here, though. Have a good day.

1:14:52 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay, have a good day. See you guys tomorrow.

1:14:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
See ya. Yeah, Jemaine has a question. Have you guys ever used like an LAM, a large action model, or implemented one?

1:15:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Not yet. Can you describe it more?

1:15:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
I can't hear you.

1:15:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
It has a name. If Chinmay doesn't catch what I say, could you fill in on it later in Gabby?

1:15:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Has a name?

1:15:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes. Can you derive it more like L-A-N?

1:15:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I will. Can you just describe it to Jonas later if he doesn't catch everything?

1:15:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, can you hear me clearly or is it me that's lagging out?

1:15:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I can hear you.

1:16:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, could you describe it to Jonas later? Yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay, a large action model is a model which, or an LLM, which can perform like a set of actions to complete a task. So for example, I could tell a large action model, hey, book me a ticket to LA from San Francisco, and then it'll go on the web browser browse to the web page, find an appropriate flight and date, and basically do the entire task for you. And how it does that is basically by doing what Chen Mei describes. It creates a roadmap to get to the final destination, and then for each of those sub tasks, each of those tasks on the roadmap, it creates another like sub roadmap, how to achieve that. And that it does before trying to accomplish anything so that it's always staying on track for the like original mission. And I think we'll need to do something like that for, for ADAPT in the long term too, where Do I mean automated bookings? It's not just automated bookings. The point of an LEM is it can do anything related to browsing the internet. You can tell it any tasks and it'll create a roadmap on how to complete that task. For example, automating bookings or Thank you. Signing up for Google or anything. You just tell it to do it and it creates a plan on how to do it and then browses the web until it gets, yeah, by following step-by-step instructions which it itself created. So you have one bot that creates an outline of how to perform a task. And then another model goes through each step by step and tries to perform them. And for each large task, it generates sub-tasks as it browses through and sees the web pages. I think we'll need something like this to stay coherent with the data over a large period of time. Yeah, Hasni? Go ahead. Hasnain sayyed Yeah.

1:18:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
You have mentioned automated booking for the large action model. But in a technical perspective, we need to use the API for the booking website to automate that task. If I'm a human, I can generally type, I want to go from LA to India, and I can book a ticket. But for a system or for AI, it needs to have access to that particular website. So are you talking about like we have an API running at the back end?

1:18:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I mean literally an AI model acting exactly as a human. It's literally going through moving the mouse and clicking buttons and acting as a human browsing the internet. It doesn't need any API keys or anything. The reason I'm bringing this up is just because LAMs are very good proof of concept for how to get a model to cohesively stay on one goal for a long period of time, while being distracted by lots of things. So yeah, as mentioned to an LAM, you can tell it's a complex tasks, like book a ticket, where it will have to figure out how a date picker UI works and all that. And it'll actually go through and like correctly browse the internet as if it were a human by moving a mouse and clicking buttons.

1:19:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

1:19:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the system they use to stay on track is a similar system to what we can use for that. So I think it's valuable if you and Chinmay go and take a look at some large action models, how they're implemented, how they work, and basically try to see if you can take any inspiration from those.

1:19:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, sure. We will explore the large action models.

1:20:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, anything else before we hop off this meeting? I'll just come to you and gather work.

1:20:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, sure. Chinmay, have you shown him the error that we have solved?

1:20:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can probably hop off Google Meets. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll see you guys on the other.

1:20:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

1:20:34 - Hasnain sayyed

Wed, Aug 28, 2024

0:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
ice bath. So yeah, I'm into the place.

0:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I heard ice baths are good for concentration. I'd love to have those too.

0:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, they're full on, but they're good.

0:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. So basically, my goals here for this meeting is to understand the whys and the whats of the LMS. Sure. So that I can work with it properly. Do you have any other agendas we could add in?

0:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
No. I think let's keep it to that. I think that's a good one.

0:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. So the way I envision it is that I'm going to show a presentation of the specs including the including the LMS part, and then I'll explain it, how I interpreted it on my end. You interject and tell me whether I got it right or I got it wrong, and then we basically end it with me asking you further questions.

1:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

1:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Sounds good. Let me share my screen then. Entire screen.

1:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Can you see my screen now?

1:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can, yeah.

1:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

1:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Can you now see my screen?

1:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep. Okay. Let me just find the LMS.

1:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, you're already here. Nevermind then. Okay. So, Primarily, the way I understood it is that our management system is... Sorry. Okay, okay. Let me know when you're ready.

2:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think they're charging. They're flush. Now they're charging. So they're not going to work. No worries.

2:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ok.

2:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so let's go.

2:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. So let's begin. In RLMS, it is comprised of several programs, each with its own duration. Like for example, a mindfulness program starting from August 28 up until September 20.

2:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to connect to these. Hold on.

3:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

3:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just need to change the audio over. Hold on a second.

3:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hey, can you hear me now? Yes. Weirdly enough, clearer.

3:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm on my headset now, so this is much easier. OK.

3:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Do you want me to restart again?

3:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Would it be useful if I gave you the overview?

3:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually, even better. Yeah, you give me the overview, and then I ask you questions. I'll just follow you right now.

3:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the point of this is to fundamentally provide content on a daily basis to users over a set period of time.

4:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's basically it. So with that, we can create a program. A program has a start and an end date. A program could have a fixed start date. So let's say we might do a program that has an intake three times a year. So we are running the program three times a year. Or alternatively, it's a static program where if you sign up today, you can start this program. It's your program. You started on Monday.

4:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Do the users sign in multiple programs?

4:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, that's a very good question. Yes, because we would have the basic program and we could have an advanced program and a very advanced program and level three, level four, level five, level six. So you can have multiple programs over time. Um, we would have, that's a, that's a good point actually. Um, Let's take this and add it in here. Challenges program also has progression of a one, two, three, four, something like that.

5:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I think you can only do one at a time.

5:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
One at a time, at least for our prototype, for the time being. Got it.

5:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So a program has duration and calendar. Those challenges I'll come back to. I don't know if that's the right place for them. So they can start, that's not the right thing. So they can start at set dates by adapt or, We have a user-driven start, something like that. So does that make sense around the program element?

6:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, I can understand still.

6:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

6:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then again, this is an optional sentence. This is optional in that it doesn't have to be mandatory in every program. Um, so in the first eight week program, right, this is all about habit formation. So we will probably have a theme for the week. So week one might be all about habit formation. It doesn't actually really mean anything. Like it doesn't make, there's no rules that the LMS needs to implement because of this. It's just a, it's, it allows the agents to understand where they are in the overall program, what the theme of the week is.

7:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

7:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's a grouping construct, that's all it is.

7:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
A week may have an event, like a live event scheduled, but we will run that event outside the LMS, but we might just be able to talk about it. Like, if someone was looking at the calendar, they would see that there is an event, but the event isn't, we're not asking for the LMS to orchestrate that event, if that makes sense.

7:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

7:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
A question for you. If I, as the admin person, want to send everybody a message, like, hey guys, sorry, we're gonna have to shut the service down for Sunday to do a release, something like that, and that message was to go out to everybody's chat, would that be something in the LMS or would that be something in admin?

7:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think that can be something in admins. Do you want some kind of a notification?

8:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, from the owners, from the founders, the message from us.

8:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's something in admin.

8:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Can you let me know what's the end goal of this? Why is there an assumption that it is in the LMS, like the notification?

8:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm asking you if it's in the LMS. I wasn't saying it was. I was asking the question, should it be?

8:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay. Misunderstood it. Thank you for clarification. Yeah, but that sounds like an admin thing.

8:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's put that there for now, okay.

9:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we're clear for now?

9:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, yeah. So we basically just went through weekly themes.

9:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to weekly themes, the question I'd like to ask is when does a week start? Is it up for the admin to decide or is it like we have a set start of always Sunday or something like that?

9:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that's something that needs to be set in the admin panel for a program.

9:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

9:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So a weekly team will also have its duration, got it.

9:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Start day under program.

9:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Most likely, certainly for the first 8B program, it's a Monday to Sunday cadence.

9:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Mhm.

10:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um.

10:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
I understand what we have to do here. It's annoying that comments don't go with the boxes.

10:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so let me explain this. So you come on to ADAPT, you sign up, it's a Wednesday and we say great. There's a number of things you need to do first. You need to confirm that you have your trainers, that you're able able to walk, that you've done your food shopping, that you've done X, Y, and Z, you're ready to go. That might take some people an hour, because they might have it all, and it might take people five days. Until they've done that, you can't start. So if you come in on the Monday and say, I've just got my trainers, I'm ready to go, we would say, well, OK, you've missed today's start window. You're going to start next Monday, which is fine. But if you came in on the Thursday and you have everything done, you can start on the Monday, no problem.

11:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, wait, wait, I think I might have to re-digest that. So basically, if what I'm getting, if what I'm understanding is correct, in each program, we have an onboarding process to something like a to-do list, right, that the user has to do. With regards to this activity, how do you visualize them happening? Like, for example, if we do just like a set of, you know, checklists, the user can just click, check, check, check.

12:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, no, no. It's part of the onboarding conversation with the mentor.

12:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, so basically, okay, okay.

12:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the mentor agent will go in here and saying, so Will is on the basic, on the program level one. Level one has this criteria to start. The mentor agent will then work with that user in order to get that checklist done.

12:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That might. OK. I would have to connect with Chinmay on this one with regards to the mentor agent, but

12:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean all that's all that would be in the LMS is a checklist.

13:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

13:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then how that's manifested and tracked is up to the mentor agent.

13:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Okay.

13:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then we start the program proper after the onboarding, right?

13:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Now they could lie and say, I have all of that stuff ready to go today. We're not looking for, we're assuming people are telling us the truth, so we're not trying to do any validation on that.

13:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Precisely. That's what I'm worried about too with the onboarding, but yeah. For the sake of the argument and the prototype, let's assume they're telling the truth.

13:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. These aren't prototypes.

13:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, this is a live product. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. For the sake of like the product moving forward, we assume for now.

13:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. We were assuming positive intent from people. We're not looking to try and challenge that.

13:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct.

13:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So you ready to move on?

14:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep. Ready to move on.

14:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

14:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, um, with all of these things, this is my assumption at the moment. And as we use it, or as you build it, you may suggest things that might need to change. But the idea, the idea is that on a daily basis, um, maybe to show you this, where is this conversation? Can you see? Where I am now? Yes.

14:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm following you right now.

14:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is an example of a daily conversation. So you get a notification or you come into the app and you have this quote. So we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit. And there's a message saying, hey, morning, Carl. Welcome to day 10. Today we're going to focus on the killer skill of forming new habits. So the day we're on would come from the LMS, where the user is. And the skill of forming new habits would be the topic for the day.

15:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Actually, that's a very, where is the LMS gone?

15:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Daily content has a type. It has a topic.

15:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
It has a daily team.

15:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

15:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is the daily team optional, like weekly team? No. OK.

15:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
There has to be a team for the day.

16:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

16:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And this is set by the admin, right?

16:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Yeah. All of this is set by the admin.

16:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

16:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

16:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where have I gone? Okay.

16:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is just another example saying, Oh, I forgot to enter my data yesterday, blah, blah, blah. We don't need to do that for here. And then it goes to Sonya is one of the founders. Sonya has a quick message for you to get your day off to a great start. Watch it here. So this would be a recorded video that comes in from the LMS, which is what we're calling it is the good morning message. Just a video, just a video. Again, from your point of view or the LMS's point of view, it doesn't really matter. It's just a video.

16:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then there's, yeah, so there's like some, notifications around milestones, potentially there's some data capture around bedtimes. And then we have the next piece of content, which is the bottom line video. So this is the main piece of content every day that if they consume all of the content, then they're going to get a better mind score because we're helping their mindset. This is the educational piece. And there may also be an article for them to read. There could be a link we send them to, to a website, you know, stuff like that. It could be a blog post on our website for them to read something like that.

17:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

17:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I can still, I'm still hearing you.

17:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

17:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then there's more daily updates. And then, yeah, that's just the whole daily process. So if I go back now to the LMS, so you have content that has, it could be text, it could be video, it could be an audio, docs, links, worksheets. Actually, it also could be an image. Image is missing.

18:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
There is a drip fed, so it's not available till the date. It has a shelf life. So you release it on the Monday, and it may be available to the user for three days, and then it disappears.

18:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Content. I know.

18:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So basically, the drip fed and shelf life is basically the start and end dates, right?

19:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Of a content.

19:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Or other dates of availability.

19:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes.

19:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then a piece of content can be scheduled. So for example, the quote could be First thing in the morning, so that's available from 6 a.m. For example.

19:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need to move some of these on. Conditional of other content first.

19:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just trying to move your thing down here.

19:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, put it a little bit away. That's basically for me while I'm conceptualizing everything.

19:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So you could have, for example, what you don't want to wake up in the morning is you come in, you've got the quote, the morning message, the daily message. You don't want to spam the user. This is supposed to be a simulated conversation with somebody over the day.

20:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Uh-huh.

20:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Are you making me yawn now?

20:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry.

20:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so you can schedule content. So this first, second, schedule conditional sequence. So this content, then this content, then this content a day.

20:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

20:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
These things were supposed to be examples. So text could be the daily quote aligned to the team. The quote might also be an image.

20:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Links, just URLs, docs, things to read, PDF, PowerPoint. Don't need that, that doesn't make sense. Audio is an audio file, video is a video file.

21:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, worksheets. This was an idea of like a PDF, something to fill in. I think we'll, We'll park that for now. And what we would do is, if there's a worksheet, we will create something on the website and have a link to the website, as opposed to having anything in the LMS. I think it just becomes too complex.

21:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

21:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I have a question. Since we're here in the daily content already, Do we have content that once you display it once, you're never supposed to show it again? Like, can only be viewed once? Like, for example, the way I'm thinking about this is, if I received already the morning message, I don't want to receive it again, right? Like, that's my logic. So does that same logic apply to other daily content?

22:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Possibly, remember, this is going to be a chat, so I could just scroll back and I might want to see it again. But some of the videos I might want to see again as well, like the, you know, there's the chat, but there's also in your profile, you can look at the program in terms of where you are. And I might want to go, what did we do last week? And refresh myself on that content. That's the idea here of having a shelf life for how long that piece of content is available. So something might be available for the entire program. Something might just be available for that week. And some of it might be available just for that day.

22:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct. OK.

22:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for example, the quote's probably going to be available for the whole program.

23:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
some videos to create some sense of urgency for people to say, this video is only going to be available for the next two days. You need to watch it. Once it's gone, it's gone.

23:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Got it.

23:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And I believe, lastly, the tags, they're pretty self-explanatory already, right?

23:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, which switches? Say it again?

23:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I just need to put a tag in each daily content, whether they're related to eating, moving, the mind, and sleeping, right?

23:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, in theory, every piece of content could be tagged against all four. So you could have a piece of content that's eat, move, mind, and sleep.

23:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, so multiple tags per daily content should be the norm. OK.

23:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
The reason being is that this is more for the agents to be educated about what ADAPT is. And it says, oh, so this is move content. And if someone has a question, they could go into the LMS and say, give me all the educational videos for movement or habits or whatever. Now, we might want to tag up content beyond these four.

24:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then free text. So if someone says, can you show me all the content for, like, I'm really struggling with new habits. So everything that we've tagged as a habit, or maybe we don't need tags, by the way, because maybe the LLM can actually work that out for a space in our content.

24:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
This tagging is a legacy. It's how we would have done it like 10 years ago. So I would speak to Jonas to say whether this is actually needed because maybe the agent will just understand it.

24:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

25:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Anything else? Okay, let me try to review You wrote something here in admin in section 7 down here. What does this mean?

25:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, it's not Well, I was gonna start going in to doing all the admin controls but the admin needs to allow me to do all of that so I didn't I stopped specifying it because I You'll figure it out.

25:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, it's basically like common sense that everything should be controllable with admin. OK. Yeah.

25:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is it OK if I view this for about a minute or so, just to make sure I don't have any questions?

26:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, of course. Fire away.

26:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

26:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ok. Here in the events and live session, I believe your goal here is to have like the customers engage with the human agent, right?

26:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
A human- Yeah, so we might do a group call on Facebook. We're planning to do a live session once a week, a live call. Again, all that might be is a URL to a Facebook call or a Teams call or a Google Meet with a schedule. And so the agent would know, oh, upcoming events, and it would promote it. The agent, the mentor, would basically be telling you about it. So it's a schedule of events with a URL.

26:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we can actually get rid of live session. Live session and events are the same thing.

27:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, thank goodness. I was actually a little bit confused there, too.

27:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
We didn't talk about challenges. So let me explain the point of challenges, and you can tell me where you think the best place for them to go is.

27:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

27:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if someone's doing really well, um, we might go, we think you are able to do something like take on a challenge, a challenge sort of sits parallel to the program. It's undetermined when like you don't, you, you may, you may do the program and never see a, never get offered a challenge.

27:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

27:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
An example of my challenges. So generally we ask people to walk, um, An hour, oh fucking hell, hold on a second. I've just forgotten. Daily content, daily actions. I completely forgot this. Whoa, okay. We've got to come back to that in a second.

28:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the idea is that we're asking people to walk an hour a day.

28:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
and hit their calorie targets and watch all the content. That's their actions that they need to do on a daily basis to be considered good.

28:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
A challenge might be, you know, you're doing really, really well. I think you can take it up another level. So we want you to start having cold showers. Start with the first three days is 10 seconds and you work your way up to a 30 second cold shower every day. That could be a challenge. Another challenge might be to do a 10K. A really big challenge, if you've lost loads of weight, would be to do 5K, but with a bag on your back with the weight that's missing. So let's say you've lost five kilos. Now you're going to do a 5K with five kilos on your back, so you can remember what it was like to carry that extra weight.

29:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ok.

29:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So these are just challenges that we haven't made up yet. That we'll work with the AI to figure out when we might offer them to people. So there will be eating, moving, mind, and sleep challenges.

29:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think they're part of the program because they're not necessarily explicitly linked to a week or a day. It's something that the agent will decide, the mentor might decide, hey, would you like to take on a challenge? And they might go, no. Fine.

29:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Okay. Wait, before we go to the challenges, I think challenges are deeply related to daily actions. So they're not, is it? Okay. They're not.

29:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think so. No. How's having a coat? Well, I suppose it's a new type of daily action.

30:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

30:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because if I get gone, you're not going to do a 10 K every day. It's a one-off challenge.

30:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh yeah, Fairpoint.

30:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let's see.

30:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now the daily actions, I don't know whether they're part of the LMS or they're part of the agents, but daily actions, I need to move the LMS on a second.

30:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why is that not moving?

30:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So daily actions would be walk time, you need to walk a certain amount of time, eat, which could be calorie or Low carb.

31:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sleep is just tracked.

31:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
mind is consume content an example so these things are are in yellow because I don't know if they live in the LMS or they live elsewhere. And that's something I think you need to catch up with Jonas or George on in terms of what the right architecture is.

32:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I feel like structurally this has the same idea as check-ins do right now. But I'm guessing there's a little bit of a difference. In terms of how it's calibrated, but I need to have a meeting with them about this. I'm not confident that this is related to LMS. Yeah, it needs to be somewhere.

32:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
It might be an admin in the LMS.

32:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Just to make sure, I want to know the intentions behind this. So you want daily actions because you basically want to record whether the user that we have is doing something that's good for their health, right? Like walking, eating properly, sleeping properly, and consuming good content. Is that correct?

33:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
The, you know, if you ask the question, what does it mean to do this program?

33:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're not walking and you're not eating differently and you're not consuming the content, you're not doing the program.

33:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the LMS is the LMS is only content at the moment. The program is beyond that. It's like, how do you walk? So the eat, move, mind, sleep. Actually, that's not walk. That's move.

33:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

33:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So Eat, Move, Mind, Sleep are the four pillars of ADAPT, and you need to be doing stuff across those four pillars in order to change how healthy you are, basically, to invest in your longer-term health. So what do we mean by move? Well, you've got to walk an hour a day. I mean, this is basically the fundamental ADAPT program in the first. So if you're looking at the level one program, This is the intention behind, this is the core aspect of, this isn't here, this is the program. The program, so, has a duration, it has challenges, and I think this now needs to move here. Because a program has intentions, has actions.

34:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
And these all go over here now.

35:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

35:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I understand where you're getting at. So basically, like, the whole goal of ADAPT is basically for people to actually do stuff and not just to like consume content and...

35:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Exactly.

35:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And what?

35:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

35:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we're not interested in people just consuming content. If they haven't, if they're not walking and they're not actually changing their reasoning, nothing's going to change.

35:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay.

35:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I'm gonna have a meeting with George and Jonas later about this.

35:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

35:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Now, back to the challenge.

35:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
None of this is new. I think it's just trying to find where it gets explicitly defined. Is it in the LMS or is it in admin?

36:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay.

36:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

36:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And for the challenges, basically, if the user does a lot of stuff, you want to provide them with a challenge. Like, for example, the user is consistently walking one hour a day. You basically want to tell the user, hey, since you're doing this already consistently, why not try jogging for 15 more minutes on top of it to improve your Yeah, going back to your point, it's a progression.

36:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's a progression of the actions, I suppose.

36:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

36:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

36:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So. Then we probably.

36:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
should have levels like for example here in this move in move we have levels one maybe but my concern is for example if we say to somebody hey how do you feel about taking ice baths or how do you feel about doing a breathing exercise um they're not progressions of anything in the baseline they're just new challenges ah okay okay that's why they are a separate entity from the actions itself? I think so.

37:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I don't have any questions. I think that you can answer. A lot of them is on the architectural side of it already. Okay.

37:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, no, no, no. Let me undo. Okay. This seems like a pretty productive meeting. Do you have questions?

37:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, not at all. That's really good.

38:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Pretty good meeting. Would you like a copy of the summary or no? No, no need. I'll just leave it with them.

38:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

38:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Perfect. Thanks a lot.

38:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Short meeting. Have a nice day. Bye-bye.

38:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
You too. Bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (2).txt"

Wed, Jul 17, 2024

0:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
My pre-trial to the Google One just ran out today. So the Google meeting got cut off after an hour. So I've got to get that subscription. I think it's quite valuable to be able to have more than one hour of meetings.

0:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Kun, you're muted.

0:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

0:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
For agents, we need to be able to create an agent, agent training, and then agent, I'm just going to call this role. So you create an agent. You give it its role. Like what its job is, and then you need to be able to train that agent to say, do these things, do those things.

1:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, we might want to have an actual workshop on agents, because there's probably hierarchy, because there's a supervisor agent that might be doing coordination across multiple agents in a workshop. But at a high level, this should be it. In the initial scope, we're just running a single workshop. However, when you architect this, you know that we're going to be having multiple workshops, and that the output from one can feed into another, because we've explained that. But we're not looking for that feature today. So we don't want to architect away from that, but we also don't want to build that in day one. The reason being is we want to be able to go in, create a workshop, run that workshop, and start demonstrating the capability to people pretty quickly. So at a high level, if we have the ability to create users as in customers, We have the ability to manage them. So there'd be a space per account. So you'd have some sense of company, like ADAPT company would have a workshop that would be separate from a Will's company. So we'd have a company and a space that'd be users. So there'd be some level of company. Sorry, BewhZ.

2:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. So when a user comes to our website, it might be related to either startup or improving existing business or some marketing agency to check if their marketing strategy is working or not, right? So for that, I think one, instead of just creating one agent, we need to create three different categories when the user sign-ups either they are a startup or existing business or a marketing agency, so that we can create agents based on their categories.

2:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
What difference does it make at all, regardless of which one they are?

3:03 - Biwas bhandari 
Because since three of the aspects are different, but I mean, startup and existing business and marketing agency, these three is, what do you call it? Models or ideas might be three different. We might need to give them responses.

3:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think the workshop is different, because the only difference between an existing company and a startup, for example, is a startup might not have any existing documentation, might not even have a website, where an existing company might. So it would just mean maybe at a startup, there will be more foundational basic questions asked, where an established company might give us answers to that.

3:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
But fundamentally, the actual objective of the workshop is the same regardless. The experience might be different.

4:01 - Jonathan Phillips 
My role would be to, within the workshop, discern who they are to start with and then base the following conversation on who they are.

4:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you actually look at the crux of this product, it's the ability to create an agent, give that agent a job, be able to train that agent and to do that job better, and to do that job in the context of achieving the outcome of a workshop.

4:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
There's one problem with this, and that is introducing agent creation, especially workshop creation, increases the scope quite exponentially, especially without having an example workshop to run off of Because agent creation also entails giving JP the ability to create the tools that the agents need and a lot of other complex stuff that the agents need to be able to interact with outside stuff.

5:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Perfect. So I just want to point out, you saying that now in this meeting is exactly the thing to be saying in this meeting, by the way. That's exactly the point of these meetings. It is to clarify those points of, we get to the customer, me, JP, gets to ask and go big. And you say, that bit's challenging. Now we talk about, well, what could we do? So I know, for example, in ADAPT, you haven't given me the ability to create them. But we do have multiple agents, and they are trained. So what we might say is, agent creation is out of scope. But for phase one, we know it's coming, but we will need to prescribe how many agents we need, what roles they would be for this one first workshop. We won't do workshop creation. Well, it's not created, but we will have a workshop with a workshop output.

6:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's a workshop with a workshop output, but not the ability to create um to create them but we know that's what we want to get to in the future. Makes sense JP?

6:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah as far as the the agents go again my naivety on technology just just shoot me down if I'm if I'm wrong what what the in my head the agents are trained chatbots, obviously. They have a base prompt and they have documentation to support their existence and what they think and how they work. By having multiple ones of those, obviously there's got to be some complexity in how they work together. I understand that element, but creating extra chatbots, agents, what's the complexity around doing that on the fly? Is it their interrelationship or is it just having them existing?

7:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's probably a combination, especially what we probably could do in the future, which is a scaled-down version, is have you have the ability to create agents from templates that already have tool integrations and the correct edges, so how they converse with others when they speak, already set up. And then you can use those templates to build off them and add them in. Uh...

7:46 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, I'm thinking at the moment I could in a day quite easily work out all the agents I would foreseeably need in a launch version. So if it's 10 or 15, I suppose it doesn't really matter, it's just obviously the amount of effort it goes into how they react with each other, interact with each other. But ultimately, I could say, if this is a 10 person marketing agency, then we'd have 10 roles doing whatever, and that's fixed in the product.

8:18 - Jonathan Phillips 
So I'm happy in doing that. Rather than having the ability to make an agent on the fly, I'm happy to say right at the beginning, this will be enough to drive all the frameworks we want with these particular 11 agents. So I can do that. That's not a problem.

8:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

8:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
And there is, if you look at right now, sorry, two seconds. I need to cancel something.

9:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like ADAPT at the moment has multiple agents. It has a supervisor, it has a data collector, it has a coach, it has a mentor.

9:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
They're sort of hard-coded. They have different jobs and different roles. So I'm assuming we can lift and shift that. And maybe there's seven other agents that are required. But it's fundamentally a predetermined list of agents that will run in a workshop. So for ADAPT, when we are onboarding somebody, you have the mentor who owns the relationship and asks them questions about their profile and onboards them. And then at some point, we'll go, hey, Do you want to, yeah, we need to run a coaching session with you. So that is in essence, a workshop.

9:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now the big difference is that our workshop is not necessarily producing a visual artifact, but again, it could be a sentence like there, why you want to get married. You want to be skinny on the beach, whatever.

10:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
at its essence is almost the same. So I wouldn't imagine what we would need to be doing is saying, right, OK, so there's the all singing, build whatever you want version, which is exactly what you did, Jonas, and said, guys, that's a month's worth of work. There's the give us another month and adapt, and then we can lift and shift that, and then we just have to do a configuration, for want of a better word, for IntelliAgent.

10:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you leverage all the good experience we've done from Adapt, and then you're just changing the nature of the agents. But you have a lot of all of that shared infrastructure. And the big thing is the user experience. Like this thing here, this box here, the UI UX of the chat, it's very difficult for us to conceptually understand what a good version of that. That's very much a suck it and see it. We have to play with it to see how well it works. I don't think we need to deviate too much from Claude. It's got some really, they've got millions of pounds. It sort of works.

11:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we could run with that for now, something like that.

11:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I think the drawing you made in the mural is probably quite good. One thing, you put UI UX under workshop, the workshop one. That kind of indicates to me that there's going to be a different UI for each workshop, but I'm not sure that's quite what you mean.

11:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's definitely the overarching multi-modal workshop UI, left hand, right hand. But for example, in the brand workshop, having this sort of idea of option A and option B, that's a capability that might not be relevant as a feature in every workshop.

11:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Makes sense.

11:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, Nazif?

12:04 - Nazif Barassounon 
I have one question about the workshop. I was wondering if we can imagine the users to have multiple projects so they can run the same type of workshop.

12:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, remember, certainly at a marketing level of what JP is working, it tends to be at the company level as opposed to a project.

12:35 - Nazif Barassounon 
So if I understand correctly, one company means some kind of one project. It's a one-to-one relationship.

12:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
There is no sense of a project here. It's just there is a marketing plan for a company.

12:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
There will be obviously different campaign ideas as you go through but ultimately it's more of a thread running through your to create a plan rather than working and executing and working within a project.

13:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
giving me a really good idea. So one of the things we need to do, you've got a company, right? And a company has a, and JP, you'll need to educate me on this, has a marketing plan, a marketing plan. Sorry, no, no, no. You have a marketing strategy.

13:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
or you probably have a brand purpose, you have a marketing strategy, then you have your marketing plan.

13:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
You would then potentially have a product and then a product will be something that is like a product is a subset of your marketing plan. If you had 12 products, you might then do a social media plan, but again, that might be, um, I think it would be specific.

14:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. So, so, so you're right. You, you would be able to within your marketing plan, your holistic business plan, marketing plan for your company level, you could have a number of campaigns and those campaigns are directed towards different products or different target audiences with different messages.

14:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. And so, You could either go down the company part. So you've got a company social media plan. You've got a company content, or no, it's a campaign, social media campaign. And then you could do a company social, or basically content plan. Something like that, whatever the hierarchy is, right? Because that's going down the company route. If a company had multiple products, then yes, you could do those three here for a product.

15:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
But if, for example, if you, you go through your company marketing strategy, obviously it gives you a, an output within that you'd have your social media plan. You'd have your, like you say, your product plan and marketing communications plan, and maybe several, but If you did this on Claude, for example, you'd be able to still deviate a little and have sub plans within it quite easily without having to necessarily do a completely different strand.

15:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
There has to be a hierarchy.

15:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
So if I get this right, basically, workshops can deviate into multiple branches. One branch could be going down a company route, where you're going down some workshops to get company social media plan, all of those done. And another branch could be for a specific product or many products.

16:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it's actually probably like this. You have your marketing plan, you have your company social media plan, or you go down as one product. You're either going to market and making people aware of your company or making them aware of a product or a service or an offering.

16:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or both.

16:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for example, in ADAPT, the ADAPT company and the ADAPT product are one and the same thing. We're too small to have a difference. Coca-Cola has the Coca-Cola company, Coca-Cola the brand, 7-Up, and all their sub-products have their own campaign strategy. They honor the parent identity, but each product line has its own go-to-market strategy. So you have a different company.

17:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a difference between the company and the product. I think you're right, Jonas. A workshop needs to have a scope. Am I doing this for a product or am I doing this for a company?

17:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is just the nature of the scope and the hierarchy. And in essence, The story framework, by the way, takes you down this hierarchy.

17:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

17:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I think one of the things that I've learned from JP is that loads of people are figuring out, and there's loads of AI doing social media campaigns and content plans and content calendars out there right now. But if you don't have your brand purpose, your marketing strategy, your marketing plan aligned, You're doing all this work down here, and you've got no idea if it's honoring what you're trying to do in the world.

18:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

18:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is why we've intentionally started at the start of the journey with figuring out what your brand purpose is. The next workshop would then be this one, this one. Now, there comes a point where, yes, we will have to ask you to create another workshop with new agents and a new role. And at some point, we'd want the ability to do that ourselves. But I also understand that the the building the capability to automatically generate workshops and new agents and then configure them in a particular way is extensive.

19:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
The brand purpose, once you give us that hard code, for a better word, you could duplicate that. And actually, the first protocol would probably be this. They're just separate workshops, separate instances of workshops. There's probably no linkage between them. There is cognitively to the brain, but not technically. Or maybe there is. But initially, we're just talking about a single workshop, knowing that we want to grow to other workshops.

19:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
Excuse my ignorance. If, for example, you have your facilitator bot, for a better word, who has the whole framework in its knowledge base, then if you modify that, the other bots will just react with that? Or is that just very naive to understand that if the workshop is modified with one agent, the others can't, that they've got to be programmed differently? Is that correct?

20:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
As I understand it, we would actually have a facilitator per workshop. Because the facilitator is basically the supervisor. It's telling you what happens in that workshop. Now, you may have a supervisor or supervisors to do the coordination from one workshop to another workshop. But ultimately, how an agent behaves in a workshop has to be quite tightly defined. There's not a suddenly, oh, I've created a new supervisor, so bots automatically react to it.

20:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
But wouldn't you, within the framework, just so you numbered it 20 within the framework, wouldn't you just say, here are all the parameters in workshop 4. This is how you behave in workshop 4. Or again, is that just naive?

20:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll let Jonas answer that one.

20:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think fundamentally here, one of the things we use is LangChain, which lets you start completely different conversations with completely different prompts, et cetera. At intervals, which is really good at guaranteeing that a conversation or a task gets done a very specific way, as opposed to just giving an entire outline to a facilitator bot. If you give an entire outline like that, it can deviate. And if it deviates, it practically entire conversation is ruined, LangChain helps eliminate that possibility quite extensively. That is one of the primary reasons why it's so hard to say we can make an ability to create workshops in the applications, because we will need to craft those graphs to ensure that the bots comply with the order of the tasks that should be done.

22:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
The facilitator bot would be coordinating between those graphs?

22:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I would urge some caution is, there's a reason why no one else is doing this yet in the market. It's quite difficult to run workshops.

22:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
We know we want to be able to create them independently of you guys at some point. But that might be too advanced. And it's a problem that adds no value, actually. The reason why we're asking for that is that we feel that if you give it to us, then we can go and create whatever we want. But designing software that can do anything is very, very difficult. It's much easier to design software that does a thing. So ultimately, what we want to do from this first phase is prove that we can run a really good workshop as good as people. That's the exam question. If we cannot do this for a brand purpose workshop, we haven't proved anything. So everything has to be around proving that we can run a workshop, an actual workshop, dynamically with different agents providing different inputs into a session.

23:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's where this gets exciting, because we have something quite new and novel in the industry.

23:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I completely agree.

23:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, JP, does that resonate with you as well? Because I know it's not everything that you want, but it does allow us to prove that the concept and the theory works.

23:35 - Jonathan Phillips 
Of course. Of course. We need something to go and show people, because that's what we're desperate to do. We want to show off. We've got a great idea. We want to show off. Also to start to recruit partners and suppliers and people who are interested.

23:51 - Jonathan Phillips 
But I don't want to overcomplicate it at the same time. But we do obviously need a differentiator. So we don't want to water it down to the point where we're the same as everybody else. We need to push And push to make it hard because then you've got a barrier to enter. And that's what we want to do. We want to make it so that people can't just say, I love that idea. And in three weeks time, they've got a similar model. We want to make it hard, which doesn't make it easy for you guys. But it's also a challenge for you guys to be brilliant so that you've created something that is hard to emulate.

24:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I go through each of these things, authorization, user management, I'm going to put to green because that should be a lift and shift from ADAPT. Needs exactly the same stuff.

24:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Agent role, agent training is exactly the same as ADAPT. Yes, there'll be different agents and there'll be new agents and more agents, but the capability is there. Is completely new. Workshop, workshop output. I think, Jonas, the concept of a workshop, because the why workshop should be the same, the workshop output would potentially be the same.

25:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
The workshop is completely different, and how to set it up will be in a completely different way. We'll have to set up the graph, as mentioned, to run through each of those processes in an implementation data level.

25:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
How is it any different from running the why workshop in ADAPT than running the brand purpose workshop in IntelliAgent?

25:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
There will be a lot of similarities, but the main thing we can lift and shift over will be our experience, which will, of course, speed it up, but we can't lift and shift everything.

25:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
But explain why. You're not telling me why there. You're just saying something, but I'm not disagreeing.

25:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
The why is more of a very technical reason. We can get into it if you want.

25:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, tell me in a non-technical way.

25:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because the reason why I'm saying this is understanding the why of a customer in the context of ADAPT is exactly the same of what we just did in terms of understanding the why of a company.

26:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the outcome is the same. There is a sentence or a number of sentences that reflect the outcome of the conversation.

26:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, the only maybe difference is that in the IntelliAgent version, you might have multiple agents participating, whereas in the context of ADAPT, there's just one coach. But functionally, the nature of having a purpose or having an outcome and asking questions to achieve that outcome is identical.

26:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if there's a Venn diagram of adapt features to IntelliAgent features here, like if I was to do this here and I go adapt and I was to do IntelliAgent and I was going to fill that with nothing and fill that with nothing. I think the Venn diagram is probably like that.

27:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
In fact, actually, I think the Venn diagram is that.

27:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think ADAPT is a subset of the IA needs.

27:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think what you're doing for IA is an extension of what you do for ADAPT, but it's significantly overlapped.

27:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I can say that the level of performance that you guys are looking for isn't something that can ever, like, with the current technology, just be lifted and shifted like that implementation-wise. In addition, us doing a large part of it. Again, of course, we'll take over all of our experience and such. So if we were to remake Adapt right now, it would be done very fast because a lot of development is just experience. We want to remake that better too and align it purely with intelligence flow. We don't want to be limited by what we've done for Adapt.

28:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

28:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
But remember, the exam question we're trying to answer is, This is not about building the coolest technology and the best technology right now. The exam question is, can we demonstrate running a marketing workshop so that we can garner interest and excitement about what's going on? So lifting and shifting the code and then modifying it rather than starting from scratch feels far more sensible given the overlap. I still, at its essence, they're the same workshop. Just one's talking about the why of a customer, a person as opposed to the why of the company.

29:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
At its essence, they are identical to me. Now, I might be wrong. I'm not saying I'm right. I'm just not hearing an argument from you as to why they're different.

29:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's very difficult to give a non-technical answer. I think it will be easier after we create more, the finer parts of the implement, like after I go over with the blockchain developers into how we will architecture them both, then we can compare.

29:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why would the architecture be different between them?

30:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I might have...

30:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello, guys, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

30:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so isn't the architecture of a tab...

30:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, if I remember correctly...

30:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Aren't there specifications in Longchain that are specifically made for ADAPT's business purposes? And if we try to adapt it to IntelliAgent, it would require significant rewrite, which makes it inefficient, which makes it better starting from scratch. Sorry, I'm just reviewing the source code just now, so I'm not so sure if I'm getting it right.

31:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is it correct, Jonas?

31:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Looks like Kevin wrote that.

31:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sum up of a lot of what you're looking at currently, I don't think is what Cuan refers to lifting over. You're probably looking at the part that hasn't been started on yet, or we're discussing the part that hasn't been starting on yet. Yeah, which the getting to know your why. One thing I remember just now is you want the intelligent outputs from the getting to know your why workshop has to be unique. The one for That doesn't really have to be unique. No one cares if your why is unique. It's your why. You don't have to sell your why to anyone else. But if you have the exact same brand purpose as someone else, that's something you guys mentioned you want the bots to be able to determine.

32:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Potentially, right? There's running a workshop and there's enhancements of that workshop where you might have an agent that goes and does competitor analysis in real time. That doesn't necessarily need to be there for phase one.

32:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
In all of these things, right, there's goal placing, there's the core functionality, and then there's goal placing. But that's just another agent with another role in a workshop.

32:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's nothing more than that. If we agree with the scope that we've talked about today, there's probably another workshop on, like, let's go in, like, I don't know who the UI guy is, but maybe we can mock up a very quick interface to start playing with it and seeing if that sort of works. When we talk about the agents, say, JP, OK, list out all the agents. How are they going to behave? What do they want to do? So take this down to the next level of what, in this particular workshop, tell me all the agents that you need will be the next level of conversation down. So let's not make assumptions about the complexity of something. And again, I understand I oversimplify things because that's how my simple brain works. Otherwise, it just gets too confusing. But I think there is It seems odd to me that we wouldn't lift and shift, adapt into this because it feels like there's a good, like a significant overlay. Why would we start again? It just doesn't make any sense to me.

33:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
For us, it isn't starting from scratch. As mentioned, if we restarted that now, it would go a lot faster because we have the experience of creating something very similar, which means when we create it again, we will be working faster. We will have experience. Our estimates will be a lot more accurate.

34:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
As you mentioned, I'm not saying any concrete reason for why we can't lift and shift anything, but I can't say we can do it when my intuition and my technical knowledge tells me we likely won't be able to lift and shift everything.

34:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
But hold on a second. Let's say ADAPT was a bit further down the line, right?

34:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is there anything stopping you taking a copy of that code and running an instance two of ADAPT?

34:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you gave me a copy of the ADAPT, the entire code base right now, OK, and you've got user management and user authentication built in there, JP will then get that for free. Why would we rebuild that? There is a workshop called the Personal Why. Rename that to Company Why. And yes, you've got a single bot running a brand workshop. Might need six more bots in there. But you've got the workshop running on a single agent. And we're going to say, OK, add in three more agents. Add in this. Add in that. There's no part of my brain that's going, listen, I totally understand. You've built it over here. You can take that knowledge and build it again quicker. But it's so similar. Why would you not lift and shift and duplicate the code? I just can't wrap my head around it.

35:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay. So, let me try to see if I get what you're saying, Cuan, right now. So basically, what you're saying is, given that there are some overlaps with certain functionalities between ADAPT and IntelliAgent, it's a very good idea to copy some of those functionalities and transfer them over, right? That's what you're saying.

36:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, for me, apart from the nature of the business, it's almost identical. Like, ADAPT has the ability to take a conversation and say, that's a good response, that's a bad response. Yeah, we've got that capability. That exact feature is needed in a teleagent. Are you going to rebuild that capability for IA or just take it from ADAPT?

36:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I see what you're saying. I think in essence, some of it is, in technical terms, possible. However, that doesn't guarantee that it would be for free. It would just mean that we would probably be able to redo it better because of the lessons that we've learned.

37:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Guys, let's be really clear. We don't need Rolls-Royce code. We need code that's working. If something's functional and adapt and meets the needs of IntelliAgent, we should not be spending any time re-architecting it or redesigning it or rebuilding it. We're a startup. Time to market is everything. Not phenomenal. The code needs to be robust and solid. Re-architecting and re-engineering a solution that's totally functional and works. There's two scenarios. One, what you've built for ADAPT is either shite and you need to rebuild it. And so you're going to take the opportunity for IA. I've got a question then, why have you built something so poorly? Or what you've built for ADAPT is totally functional. Why would you not just reuse it exactly as it is? If it's good enough for ADAPT, it's good enough for IntelliAgent. I just don't want us wasting time and money building stuff that we don't need to build so we can spend the time on the bits we actually need to build.

38:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
The whole good response, bad response, admin screens, 100% can be identical between adaptive and tally agent. 100%, there shouldn't be a single bit of difference.

38:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
That will definitely be copied over. But there will have to be some new integration with how IntelliAgent will work, especially with how they work with files and everything. We'll have to integrate that into the reviews so that the reviews have the context that the agents have. But otherwise, the fundamental nature of it, we will take over.

38:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
But ADAPT has right built in as well that there should be contextual files that the agents only use for their information.

38:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
It'll be stored different when files are generated live compared to those huge PDFs, which we run generations on to generate embeddings that we store in a database and then pull from, because the documents are so large compared to the ones that will be generated. There will be some integration difference, but of course, a lot of time will be saved there. OK.

39:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you mean by generation? There's nothing being generated in IntelliAgent that needs to go anywhere else.

39:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
The brand statement, the messages on the right that are generated, the bots will have that in context.

39:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that's not files being uploaded though. There is a section where users can upload their existing brand artifacts or give me a website URL, and we'll go and scrape that. But that's just putting it into the same, rather than me uploading a book in Adapt, we're just uploading another content. That's the same capability, fundamentally. Yes, the UX, UI is different. I get that. But the underlying capability is there's a repository of content that we want the agents to look at.

40:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I'm concerned about is that there might be a, and I'm not saying I'm right by the way, there might be a misinterpretation of actually what is needed. And you guys could, with good intent by the way, go and start building lots of really cool shit that actually doesn't materially shift the needle that we could have repurposed from a doubt. A, we spend less time, we spend less money. The most important thing is that we get this into the market.

40:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
And to a degree, the difference between IA and ADAPT is lipstick. Is the UI, the UX, that screen, get it? Big difference. But under the hood, the raw capabilities are, we have multiple agents, we have the ability to give feedback to multiple agents, and they're working on an outcome. All of those things exist in ADAPT.

41:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. And the reuse functionality will primarily be if I start over, but it'll be like 95%, not 100%. Like we can't just.

41:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. No, no. I mean, I would, you know, even if you're saying there's probably an 80% reuse from a dot. Perfect. I'm not expecting it to be a hundred percent at all, but when you start hearing, we're going to just take our learning and I'm going to rebuild it. That's what scares me, because I don't... Listen, in an ideal world, would I like to do that? Of course I would. It's a great way to do it. Re-engineer it, do it faster, better, quicker, it's great. But ultimately, does JP end up with a particularly new feature set? Not really. It's like, at the end of the day, and this is the challenge for technical people, if it doesn't break, no one gives a shit how good the code is. They just don't care. Because it's not the bit that we play with. We play with the outputs. We play with the screens and the interface.

42:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
We care what it looks like and what it's experienced like, So in that regard, we do care about the underlying tech. But no one cares whether it's land chain, or blueberries, or bananas, or what your test coverage is. Customers don't care about that. They just assume it works.

42:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, everyone cares about all of that massively when it breaks.

42:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
But if you have slightly dirty code, but it's functional and it works, no one cares.

42:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, we care when we've suddenly got 100, 400, 500 concurrent users and it doesn't work anymore.

42:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
But let's be clear. We have zero customers today, zero revenue today, time to market. With some compromises is probably better than beautiful code. There's this tension that we should always be maintaining, is how can we reuse what we've built?

43:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. One thing, I think we should probably be wrapping this meeting up soon so that we can go over everything and then probably pick it up another day.

43:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sure.

43:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
One thing about the getting to know your why workshop, for ADAPT, will that be using a specific framework? Because for IntelliAgent, it'll be using the story framework. But for ADAPT, my perception was that it would be more.

43:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
The story framework is an overarching framework where all the workshops exist in. The brand workshop does not use the story framework to deliver the brand.

43:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

43:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
The framework is a meta framework over the entire suite of activities that could be 70 workshops.

44:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
But within the brand workshop itself, it's basically the sort of questions that me and JP asked. Now, we can take that down to another level. But fundamentally, there is no framework for understanding why. I mean, apart from actually asking the question, why? Why are you doing this?

44:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
something inside of us that went, that doesn't feel satisfactory. It doesn't feel there's something inside of me and JP that we didn't just go, great answer. Brilliant. Like, no, no, no. We have an internal criteria. And listen, me and JP are not aligned. We didn't speak about this before the meeting, but both of us were sort of going, Too technical. There was some judgment that we were making on what you were saying. And the challenge is, how do we codify that? And the only way I think we can do this is by you giving us the capability. The bot runs a workshop, and it'll be a bag of shit. And we get to go, no, no. You don't say that. I would have asked this. Oh, I would have gone deeper there. That's really interesting. Oh, and that's one of the reasons why I was speaking to a coach this morning on the adapt thing. Why I think it's really, really important that we go to speech. Because there's something what's called in coaching called the unspoken word, the pause, the intonation. Do I speak faster? Am I getting excited? That can't come across by text.

45:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so the sentiment of somebody, how they're speaking, the pace at which they're speaking, also conveys a huge amount of information that me and JP were picking up. How you were saying things, you were leaning back. All of these things are cues to us as to what's going on. And as much as possible, if you look at Adapt, I sent that link to thrive.ai, which is the Sam Altman, Ariana, fucking, they should be the best coach in the world. It's a bag of shit. It's rubbish. Because it sort of doesn't care what you say. It's just a question, because it's only taking text. It's not connected to what's going on, really. And the thing that's going to be different here, the IP, is how do we codify JP into the agents? To go, no, no, I wouldn't, that thing there, that's really interesting. And the agent goes, why the fuck was that interesting? Well, here's why, let me tell you. So actually, just the good, potentially the good response, bad response, prompt pages are probably going to be the really interesting bit that might need to change here to give it more information than just saying that was bad and here's why. I don't know. But that, for me, is the thing we need to get to, where a very rudimentary bot knows its outcome. So I can go to an LLM right now and say, let me look at this.

47:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
In the meantime, can I ask you JP? Do you think you could run our brand identity workshop through text only?

47:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's possible the reason that I I Like speech is because I do everything through speech so I dictate everything I tend to do speech But also our target market will be a lot of people who don't sit at computers So a lot of them will have a smartphone and they won't really ever sit at a laptop unless they're doing an invoice. So we see in our world, we're very laptop. We're very, we've got apps going. We sit here all day. Whereas a lot of our customers are going to be people who are landscape gardeners who are in the garden or the cleaning business, or they're in a restaurant. So they will have a few minutes or 10, 15 minutes where they may want to do it through a smartphone. So speech is the fastest way, and it's also the most accurate way to do it quickly.

48:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
So I think that's the target.

48:19 - Jonathan Phillips 
And that's nothing to do with the quality of, is text better than speech? That's just a usability aspect of, I think, most of our customers will want to speak.

48:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Assuming then I gave the user the capability to record their message, and then it was converted to text before it was sent to you. From that, do you think you could run an effective brand identity workshop?

48:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
As long as it's fast, the latency is good, then yeah. I mean, it's not a problem how it's delivered, it's just from the user perspective, they're talking and having a conversation.

48:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
I want to challenge that because As soon as you convert voice to text, you lose all sentiment, you lose all pauses, you lose all intonation. And all of those things are actually quite important in running these sorts of workshops. Because at the end of the day, remember when JP was speaking to you Jonas he was asking where's the emotion what's the emotion of this and if you take that that comes across in voice and again we're looking to do the sentiment analysis of tone and intonation in ADAPT We're aware that there may be a lag in the time and the performance, and we need to do a trade-off on that. But I think that's something we need to figure out the right answer is. I'm concerned of the efficacy of text only on both of these workshops. I think it's unnatural to do these with text.

49:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
You would generally talk about them. It's more organic. So what I mean, if I look at this right now, Help me find out what my brand purpose is.

50:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, at some point, Claude has decided what it means to be a brand purpose is. And it's asking me questions. No one's asked it to ask those questions. So what I'd expect is for us to have the ability to do this and for JP to go, no, that's not the first question to ask. I would have asked this question first. Go again. We go again. And we just keep on doing that over and over again until the agent starts to behave as JP would have behaved in this context, in this workshop.

50:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't believe that you should be giving us a finished workshop agent. You have to give us the ability to have multiple agents looking to achieve a common outcome that JP can give feedback to to say, yes, that's good, that's bad. I understand. Because I don't know how many questions it's going to ask me, nor that it does. It has some framework. There's some algorithm in the back or some weighting that says, I've now asked another question. I don't need to ask another question. Sorry.

51:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there is some raw capability available in LLMs to run a workshop right now. It's just not very good. It's very generic. And if me and JP run Claude simultaneously, we're going to get to a similar outcome. But actually, what we're saying is, if we codify JP's way of doing it and the standards that he wants, that's the difference.

51:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Could I ask you then, JP, after what Cuan said, this is just because doing sentiment analysis can increase the scope quite a bit. How essential do you think it is to be able to hear the person speak compared to doing the entire workshop through text?

51:58 - Jonathan Phillips 
This is all iterative.

52:01 - Jonathan Phillips 
Like Karina said originally, my vision is to have a interface which looks like what we're looking at now, a Zoom interface with all the video characters who aren't real people, they're AI avatars, all having a conversation, all with their areas of expertise. That's the holy grail. So how we get there, because that will be possible in a few years' time, without a shadow of a doubt, but how we get there, is is a journey we don't know at the moment but I just want to get there but at the same time if it takes small little tiny steps that's fine but we need to be able to make sure that the goal is is always in in our sort of like front and central we need to get there so once we once we go through the the text into the speech these are just early days because as we know technology will soon gesund that and it will soon be We won't even have to program it because it'll be in a box somewhere that we just press in. But to start with, I just want to get these things up and running and then we evolve as we go. So whatever is the quickest and the most effective way of delivering what we want, then I'm happy with that just to start with. And then obviously we are testing ourselves all the time to make it better and better.

53:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

53:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and I think we do need to learn, I have an assumption around the text, but maybe the text is OK to start. And again, if sentiment analysis slows down, like it's a five-minute response for every time someone speaks, and we can do the analysis, that's just not usable. I'd rather do text. I would take text only rather than that. And we'd have to find a way.

53:50 - Jonathan Phillips 
But what we don't want to do is go down an avenue where we can't come back. So we don't want to go down an avenue that's text and forever it will be fixed. So we want to always have the ability to jump on the latest thing, so to speak, or move forward.

54:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I was going to add on to that. I think sentiment analysis is something that will definitely be able to be added on later as an additional bit of context that the Boston is given because larger language models, they work through texts, they haven't been trained on language, they've been trained on text. So how you integrate sentiment analysis into these chatbots is through converting that audio to text along with sentiment analysis performed by a bot that did voice to text, or that interpreted a voice, which is a completely different machine learning model from large language model. And that is processed through text and generated through text.

54:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just want to make sure also that I understand the use of the word sentiment analysis, because there are sentiment analysis done where 15 customers complained on Twitter today, because it's very clear on the text, as opposed to understanding the sentiment of somebody through the tone of their voice. Are they being sarcastic? Are they being serious?

55:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm talking about that level of sentiment. It's tone and tonality, pauses.

55:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's the second one.

55:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think that's real sentiment analysis as opposed to opinion analysis.

55:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, it has to be put into words for the LLM to work with. And I think that's something we can add on to the interface later.

55:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I thought on ChatGPT, the whole point was that it can now see and hear. And that does not go via text.

55:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
That was the first one. I'm not educated enough on that topic, but from an engineering perspective, what I hear them is they use a different model to convert it smartly into text before passing it on.

56:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can we confirm that? Because my understanding was one of the big advances of 4.0 was the fact that up until 4.0, if you had a video, you had to convert that into text, into the vector database, and then it could get consumed by the LLMs. And I don't know how, but now with the 4.0, fact that it can hear and see, all the Google cars and all those cars doing mapping are now going to become LLL trainings. I don't believe they're taking all that visual cues, converting it into text to then being understood. I believe it's now able to see and understand visuals. And that's why you have them with the blind guy doing the tour saying, what's happening? Oh, that's a duck doing this. It's able to see now, and it's able to hear. I think it's bypassing the legacy translation to text before I understand it mode. That's one of the big advances in 4.0. Now, I don't think many people are picking up on that. And the big thing is 4.0 can now learn without having to be converted to text, from what I understand. I might be wrong with that, but I believe that's the big block.

57:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we'll definitely have to look more into that.

57:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. You said you needed to wrap up anyway, guys. I know it's pretty late for- Yeah.

57:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Anything else before we end the meeting, then?

57:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
Nope. First of all, thank you for everybody joining. It's good to sort of try and align, but maybe we need to do shorter meetings more often just to make sure we're all moving in the right direction.

57:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm hoping, as mentioned in chat, that now we've got more employees, and especially Will, that can hop onto IntelliAgent and take a fair bit of the load off me, because I think you guys know George is currently off uh this brother's wedding and is on for a not not too long each day so it's been mostly me managing everything and I think it'll really help with that you guys will be able to help in meetings with

58:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
other guys and align yourself a lot more often than I have been able to do yeah and I would say again whale thanks for for stepping in, apologies for stepping in, but hopefully you can see, I think, the level of conversation that we needed to have, which was, I think, a really good outcome overall. And for Nazif, Biwas, Bill, if you guys have any questions 24-7, just ask myself and JP, we're pretty much online all the time. So we will jump on calls, answer questions, whatever you need.

58:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes.

58:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
love to have a copy of the mural is it the mural the diagrams we made earlier i've sent you guys a link if you don't if you if you should be able to just access it I'll put it in

Wed, Jul 17, 2024

0:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let's see if there are any questions. In your microphone.

0:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, turn your mute on.

0:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think.

0:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, can you hear me?

1:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?

1:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, good.

1:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, perfect.

1:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just telling JP to come in. I think he was waiting for the invitation.

1:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, OK.

1:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey Nazif, I don't know if we've met yet. Hey, how are you doing? I am living the dream, I'm living the dream.

1:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so yeah, this is Nazif. He's been with us for the longest time now. He's helped us out on I've got a few projects now, mainly a large part of the web of IT now, especially in the start, and also has helped develop a contract management, sorry, contract lifecycle management platform called Up. You think it's helpful?

1:58 - Nazif Barassounon 
Cool.

2:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
How's it going, JP?

2:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
Very good, thank you.

2:03 - Jonathan Phillips 
Very good. Everyone good?

2:06 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah. I like the meeting, a lot of faces. A lot of faces, fantastic.

2:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yes, so for this meeting, since Will will be taking on the lead role in the project, he will be facilitating the meeting.

2:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Would you like to get started, Will?

2:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, is everyone okay to start?

2:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, that sounds like a thumbs up for everyone. So, hi, I'm Will and I'm one of the developers here in Tino. I'm going to be working with IntelliAgent, as Jonas had told me how to pronounce it. And for this meeting, we're going to be talking about the vision and primarily the potential backlogs of IntelliAgent. What we want after this meeting is we're going to be taking a few days to create, to refine the backlog based from your feedback and create estimations for IntelliAgent. So those are our agendas. Are those okay with you guys? Q1, Jonathan, Biwas, and Mr. Nazif?

3:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Sounds good. So let's start. I'll start by asking you, Mr. Tiwan and Jonathan, what is the vision behind Intelligent? So what's the core idea behind it?

3:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can I just, before we answer that, I just want to set some context in terms of the different roles and responsibilities that we have on our side. So IntelliAgent, JP is the main stakeholder. He's the one with the vision. He's the champion. Myself and Arif, who are running ADAPT, are working with JP on different things in the background. And so we're helping advise him. But ultimately JP is the visionary behind this. Where I sort of sometimes play, and JP can sort of keep me honest as I say this, is sort of the, sometimes the translation of the vision into something that's tactically, tactile or tactical that we can then go and build. I also taking like the things from ADAPT and going, oh, hold on a second. If we did this to your vision, we could get that for free from Adapt. Would that work? Yeah? Cool. So that's sort of the role that I'm playing, is how do we repurpose and reuse everything from Adapt and see these as completely separate products as opposed to really seeing one being an extension of the other?

5:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
So one question I have is, are these actually separate code bases? Are they the same code base? But that's still something to have in the back of our heads when we go into this. But I just wanted to set that context so it's useful as you hear myself and JP speak. I'll shut up now.

5:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think your audio cut out.

5:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry, sorry. Thank you for that, Q1. Maybe for the technical questions related to the code base, we can answer them later.

5:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So, can we start, Mr. With your vision behind IntelliJ?

5:49 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, of course. So, some background about me first. My background is marketing business strategy. So, I've spent many, many years working with businesses to help them with their strategy. So my main focus in the last or so 20 has been smaller businesses and there's a big problem with smaller businesses when they try and create business. So they start day one, they have products, they have services but they don't really know how to get them out to their target audience and they don't know really maybe who their target audience is. They've got an idea that their vision works but they don't know how to execute it. So I've gone into all sorts of businesses and tried to help them so what i've got is um sort of many years of marketing frameworks methodology systems etc but the last couple of years have given us an opportunity to try and automate that and ai is a fantastic platform to be able to Not necessarily get rid of resource, but to utilize resource where it was impossible to use otherwise. So small businesses can't afford marketing agencies. They can't really afford necessarily anybody to help them. So AI gives us the ability to emulate marketing expertise. So what we want to do really is to put all the marketing expertise into a box, give it to the small business owners who don't really know where to start and it will enable them to have a whole sort of marketing platform to project their business forward and to enable them to acquire new customers and to increase revenues.

7:45 - Jonathan Phillips 
Does that make sense to most people?

7:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it makes sense to me. It looks like Will is having some internet issues. He began lagging out. Now his camera's off.

8:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, everyone.

8:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, can you guys hear me again?

8:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, we can hear you.

8:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
The internet is not kind to me. It was working well a few minutes ago. Okay. Nonetheless, I get what you're saying. Thank you for providing your vision, Jonathan.

8:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Specifically, we would like to ask you to break it down a little bit. We have prepared questions in mind. So, let's start with the story framework. I saw it in one of your documents about story framework. Can you tell us more about it? Like, how it goes, basically?

9:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yes, it's just basically a system whereby the business owner or the marketing professional takes a concept, starts to build some flesh around that concept with how are they going to position it in the marketplace, how are they going to brand it, the target audience. They then create a a series of messaging and communications around that, and target their target audience with different platforms, different methods, and then ultimately measure what they do, see how well they do. If they're not doing too well, they change things and modify things, then it loops all the way back to them sort of creating again a number of campaigns around that. So the framework itself is something that they need to go through from sort of A to Z, but then they will be reiterating coming back, maybe back to D or coming back to L and then going through to Z again, and they can revisit any time they want. But ultimately when we talk about the technology what we want is an interface that allows the person to go very easily With no confusion from the beginning from the concept all the way through execution And then allows them to

10:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
question and nip back in any time to try and maybe change and modify what they're doing Okay, I see so In line with that, I saw in one of the requirements, particularly in rollout and adapt and growth, that we are going to be measuring performance, as you have said. Can you give us basically an idea on what you mean by measurement, like are we talking about establishing KPIs, establishing numbers to determine if the marketing strategy recommended by the AI is working or not? What's the entire vision?

11:20 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, all those things. So whatever the objectives are for that organization. And then they have micro-measurements. So when they go through campaigns, they might be looking at leads, website visits, number of opens on emails, whatever the metrics are. So there's various elements along the way, how they actually are measuring their performance. But just go back, one element that we didn't mention was the sort of multi-agent model, which is quite important to what we're doing. So we want to replicate a, let's say a marketing agency, so a marketing resource where You can imagine if there's a marketing agency with 10 members of staff or with their own areas of expertise, then what we want is a different, call them a chatbot, although we won't call them a chatbot to the marketplace, an agent who's expert in one area, and then they all work together, just like a marketing agency would, in order to help the founder, the business owner, to create their whole marketing ideology. So that's key to us. So we have this, it's something that there are other organizations globally we know working on these things, but we want to make it not only sort of better than them, but something that has certainly a unique angle.

12:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay. That is duly noted.

12:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How, yes, given that this is going to be a business of yours, how do you intend for it to work financially? What's its business model?

13:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
A subscription model where people pay monthly but they can also potentially have services on top of that. But until we start to get to play with the technology, we're not going to know exactly what levels we're working at there because we don't know what the cost is going to be. So once the technology gives us an idea of the cost behind it, we can then start to work out exactly the pricing model.

13:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

13:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Got it.

13:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to cost as well, we actually have some small, small concerns. So with regards to certain aspects, particularly if we plan rollout and adapt and growth, we have a discussion wherein the scale might be a little bit too big for division, like the technical side, it's gonna be a little bit of an endeavor. Do I get it right, Jonas? Before that, maybe Q1, you can talk first.

14:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I just want to sort of speak about the nature in which how we're running this meeting, right? So we've talked about a very, very conceptual vision from JP, and then you're dropping down into very specific points like what's the story framework? What's your go to market strategy? What pricing are you using? I'm personally a little bit confused. I'm not saying they're not valuable things, by the way. There's nothing wrong with the question whatsoever. I'm just not sure. Why we're talking about these things now. You're now suddenly talking about the scope being too big. We haven't even talked about the scope. There's a story to all of this, right? Stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. And it feels like we're talking about specific chapters or paragraphs in a book. And we're like, we haven't all read the book. We sort of know what the book's about, but we don't really know.

15:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think I would take this back a level and make sure everybody's aligned at a high level about what we're actually talking about, and then start bringing this down and understanding the scope, and then specifically what parts of that scope you have questions or concerns about.

15:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, good point. That's a good point of criticism towards how I handle things. Basically, the flow of this is I'm asking for a vision and pinpointing some of the edge cases because after that, we're going to be jumping straight into the backlog.

16:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
But more or less, So basically outside of that, maybe we can skip the costs because you're right, it's a backlog type of discussion. So before we go to the backlog, I'd like to ask the developers, do you guys have any confusion or questions with regards to the vision by Jonathan? Just to make sure we're on the same page.

16:49 - Nazif Barassounon 
Mongo too.

16:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

16:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How about Biwas? Do you have any other question?

17:02 - Biwas bhandari 
So yeah, I have one question.

17:06 - Biwas bhandari 
I want to know about the target audience. I mean, are we targeting a business or someone having a marketing agency? For example, a marketing agency would also want to check their marketing strategies, from what you said. And... Okay, my internet is quite slow.

17:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, no, I got that question. It's a very good question. Targeting a marketing agency or a business? Yeah, so we're targeting businesses with 0 to 49 employees. So it might be a solopreneur, it might be an individual who wants to start a business, or all the way up to sort of around 50 employees. But it's not exclusive. It's not a case of someone who's got 51 employees can't use it. It's just obviously we've got to target our messaging somehow. Any organization could use it. It could be used within a large organization by a marketing professional. And it could also be used by a marketing coach or a marketing agency. So there's no limit to who can use it, but we are specifically going out at the beginning with a sort of core strategy to target smaller businesses because they're the ones who predominantly don't have a marketing strategy, even some very large multi-million pound businesses don't have a marketing strategy. So there's a lot of opportunity there to get into those organizations and start to get traction on the product.

18:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, does that answer your question?

18:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, pretty much.

18:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. All right. Thank you, JT, for that. Now we're going to be jumping into this scope. Actually, we're supposed to ask questions, but I got a little bit too carried away. I asked them immediately, so I'd like to apologize.

19:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here is the current scope that we've created. Let me try to share my screen.

19:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
You guys see my screen or no?

19:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, it's coming up.

19:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
It works.

19:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, I'm sorry, I've just served as it works today. Okay.

19:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Right. So, basically we have four main epics, so to speak. Epics are like a collection of features that have So, for example, in the sales interface, it's related to sales features, admin interface, all the features an admin has, user interface, all the features that a user has, and chatbot, that's all the features that a chatbot has.

20:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to have to interject because this is a really expensive meeting with the number of people that we have on this. And I'm just reading through that backlog. And it's not aligned to the needs of JP at all, really, from based on what we've talked about and things we've shared in the past. I think there's a quicker way to do this and get us aligned much, much quicker on actually what this product is supposed to do. It feels like you guys have gone off and done a lot of work without getting aligned first. You've read documents, but I don't think you've spoken with JP and really understood what he's trying to achieve. So I don't mean to, well, I don't mean to take over this meeting, but I'm just concerned at it being a very expensive meeting. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six people on this meeting. So every hour is basically a day of time. And I think we could spend a huge amount of time doing that. And if you guys, by the way, if you guys are fine with this, I'm happy to jump off because I don't think this is a great use of my time because I don't think this is actually the right level of detail in the backlog. But if you guys want to crack on, fine. I've got too many other things to be doing. But if you agree with me...

21:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
How do you propose we move forward, Cuan?

21:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can. I think I have an idea, but I'm also conscious that I can sometimes hijack things, which I'm not trying to do, but I felt I'd be doing a disservice to say if other people feel this, and predominantly JP, I want to make sure JP's time isn't wasted and we get to a conclusion here today. I think it's really important we get that.

22:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

22:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I love this energy, Q1. I do love keeping meetings short and simple. So let's start first with you. What do you think should be the best way forward based on your experience?

22:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ultimately, JP is the customer here, right? So JP, is this format working for you?

22:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
So what is the objective of the meeting today? By the end of it, what do we want to have achieved?

22:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, good question. What we want to achieve is basically for all of us to have an understanding of the features to see if what we have in mind is the same as what you guys have in mind. So that within a few days we can... Provide you with an estimate and potentially a quotation on how expensive the app would be. Did I get it right, Jonas?

23:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, sounds correct to me. It's trying to align with the vision, getting all the developers or most the developers that will be working on Intelligent synced up with the vision, at least from a high-level perspective like we did in the beginning of the meeting, and then also making sure in kind of a shotgun method that all the backlog features are aligned as well as we can. This is just a first revision. It's like, the backlog took us an hour, two. So not too much time has been spent on it. This is an expensive meeting, yes, but it'll be for all the developers. So hopefully just getting what we have out there and aligning ourselves as quick as possible with what you guys want.

23:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff here that I think is important, and it's not... Everything that you have on the page, by the way, is useful. It's just missing the main point, which is the purpose. Like, what are the actual functionalities that we really care about? Like, subscription, authentication, all that stuff is super important. I'm not saying it's not, but it's sort of missing. We need to step through from the eyes of the customer. What is the experience here? And I would, when you present a big verbiage like this for people like myself and JP, who were not in the conversations that you guys went through, we don't know the evolution of this. It's very difficult. So there's a better way to take them. Like as a user, I need help to define buyer personas. No idea what that is. I genuinely don't even know what that means. So like in these sorts of meetings, talking about land chain and graphs, it's got no business here. That's an implementation issue. This is where we're looking right now is what are the outcomes JP needs for a product to be viable? That's the exam question we should be looking to answer, right? So would you mind if I just showed, rather than me talking at you, would you mind if I showed you what I think the answer is? And how we might make this a more effective meeting.

25:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, is everyone okay with that? Jonas?

25:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, absolutely.

25:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, okay.

25:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's go. To put in a link to the mural, people can join in and start creating in this at the same time if they want to, but I'm just going to start showing you guys what I mean, first of all.

25:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you see my screen?

25:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. Yeah, I can see your screen. At a very high level, there is definitely a sales website that you sign up to, and then you get access to run workshops or to participate, basically participate in a workshop. That's fundamentally, at a high level, the entire scope of the project. And there will be multiple workshops. So it's probably...

26:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
Let's just say for argument's sake, the number of workshops or activities or tasks or whatever within the story framework might be 400. But the tasks don't matter, because we're just building the infrastructure, the framework, to put anything we want in and modify it on the fly. So it doesn't really matter. And to have an example of a workshop, great, because it gives us the scope of what we need to build. But ultimately, we need the provision to modify the framework when we want. And the framework may have 400 tasks. And the one example we have here about the brand Where was the workshop name?

27:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'll come back to that. I've got an example of that in a second.

27:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. Sorry. Go ahead.

27:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right. And so we have there's JP as the company owner. You have the customer who signs up and you have the agent who lives in the system. So they're they're all the actors that are currently it's actually agents. OK. So in a in a workshop.

27:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So a customer, let me just look at this. So a customer, that's going to annoy me because the arrow is not straight. So JP designs workshops. Can I write on this? Yeah.

28:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
A customer needs a workshop and agents run workshops.

28:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
There we go. Does that make sense so far, in terms of the ecology of all the actors and the... Does that make sense so far? Sorry, Will, did you have a question? I didn't...

28:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, no, no. I don't have any questions so far. Okay, so...

28:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
When a customer is running, oh, sorry, go on, Vivas.

28:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, by workshop, what do you mean? Can you give some examples, some workshops?

29:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, give an example of the workshop?

29:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

29:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I will absolutely do that. I'm just going to explain one thing in a second. So have any of you used Claude?

29:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what's really good about Claude is, for example, if I said here, design me a wireframe for a health chat application, whatever. I'm just giving that as an example. So what's great about this now is that we now have a two-paned interface.

29:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
The left-hand side, which is the interactions or the conversation to running something. And on the right, you have the output. So imagine I was talking to Claude AI for an hour. This chat window will be incredibly long. But my content will always be here on the right-hand side. So as I'm doing things, and that's evolving, so I could basically say, right, make the top Banner red doesn't really make a difference. But I can now do things to the chat, and the output of the workshop is updated in real time. This sort of multimodal interface. And I think this is really important that we understand this, because now I've got versioning control. So I could go back to the blue one and start again, or I can enhance the red one. And our vision, or I think JP's vision for this is that the workshop itself, and I'll give an example of the type of workshop in a moment, the workshop will get carried out through chat, through a user and multiple agents playing different roles.

31:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then the output is produced on the other side of the page. So this chat can go up and down for as long as it wants. But the output that a particular workshop generates is on the right-hand side. I think this is really important. This is the crux of the product. This is the bit that we need to get really right.

31:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

31:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'd love loads of questions around this, because Almost the nature of the workshop, which I'll bring to life in a moment, doesn't really matter because it's the ability to do something on the left and see something on the right that gives us, as JP said, we need capability that we then customize and codify, as opposed to you designing a particular workshop, if that makes sense.

32:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So basically, it's similar to Cloud in that manner that we're focusing on the marketing side of things, right? And also, they have multiple agents compared to Cloud.

32:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Exactly. So if we, sorry, Biwas, it looked like you had a question.

32:27 - Biwas bhandari 
No, you can continue. Great.

32:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I go back to here, for example, the first, where is it here? So there are two types of companies that could come in here and be customers. You've got the startup or an established company. There is a little bit of difference, but we're going to park that for a moment. We will deal with that difference later. So the first workshop would be, we're going to call this a brand purpose workshop. What that means is helping a small business figure out their reasoning for existing. So Jonas's company, why do you exist? What is your mission statement? What's your purpose? Now, this may not be something you ever communicate externally, but do you and George have a mission statement that you guys talk about together, like why you started this company?

33:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not why we started this company, but it's why we're doing the avenue we're doing now. And that's to help subject matter experts that have a lot of experience within their specific field solve problems within their fields using our, us as like technical experts.

33:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So that, that sounds like, by the way, I'm sort of running the workshop now, just as a bit of an example. That sounds very much like a what you do. It's not why you do it. So you do that, what's different in the world for you?

34:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's your actual motivation? Why do you get out of bed to do this?

34:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
And you're not allowed to say make money.

34:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just going to pause the process there for a second. I'm asking one set of questions. Just came in as another agent there and is asking, he's holding the rules. I'm absolutely correct. So this, what we're doing right now, is what we would love the end vision to be, where each of your boxes, like me and JP, are actually AI, where we have avatars speaking like this, and you're all the customer. This is where we would love to. But we recognize that fully animated avatars is probably too difficult. Maybe we can do speech with a fixed head, like Will's picture's gone, but I can still see Will, and Will's still participating. That could work. Or it could just be pure text. So we can figure out what that journey is. But ultimately, the end-to-end vision is to do a session like we're doing right now, where we've got a group of people talking, trying to achieve an outcome, and some visual assets being created in real time on the output of the project.

35:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we are talking and I am creating something visual as a record of what we're agreeing. And as you're saying something, I'm going to change this in real time.

35:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think, forget about authentication and sign up and registration. All that's important. But none of that matters if we don't mail this. This is the product. What is that amazing interface that allows people to talk about something and then, in parallel, produce an output?

35:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think this is the thing that we've got to get absolutely, totally aligned on, that you guys imagine and can understand what the product is meant to do. Yes, there's loads of important things that have to happen in the background, but land chain, authentication, all that stuff. That's just hygiene. That's not the product. This is the product. Now, whether this looks like Claude, and over here there's boxes on a page, or it's a document, or it's a sentence, whatever, we will figure this out. But at a high level, I sort of want to get this into your bones on what the product actually is supposed to do. So when you're making this, in the back of your head, you're trying to recreate the exact experience we're having right now. Where there's a dynamic conversation and then a fixed output.

36:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does that, I just want to check, does that align to your vision as well?

36:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, perfectly.

36:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So this is the bit where I want to spend some time making sure, Will, Biwas and Azif and Jonas, that you guys can ask all of your questions because this is the bit we need to swim in and get absolutely aligned on.

37:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Please.

37:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
How do you turn this into a backlog? That's what I'm trying to figure out.

37:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
We'll come back to that. That's not the difficult part at all. Making sure that we are aligned on where this goes is most important. And then we can figure out the backlog. I can make the backlog of this in minutes. That's not an issue.

37:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK.

37:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, Biwas.

37:40 - Biwas bhandari 
So far what I have understood is, what you are referring is to something called generative UI. So for example, I want a simple roadmap for my startup and in the right side, the AI chatbot will create a flowchart in a visual representation, right? So, and if I do not like the flowchart or roadmap, then I can just simply tell it to update it and it will give me a new interface. I think that's.

38:10 - Biwas bhandari 
That's what we are trying to do.

38:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Possibly. Hold that idea, because I want to give you, I think what is presented or what is produced for each workshop could be subtly different. So if you look at the Cloud interface, it basically is HTML. It's JavaScript and HTML, and whatever you ask it, it produces there. I don't actually know. If I basically say here, go Cloud, new chat, Design me a logo for a health company. I don't think it produces the side panel in this context. I think it keeps it in the main chat.

38:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
To revise some details of the company name, it's called Adapt.

39:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, no, it does. Oh, what are they doing over there? It's creating it. OK. So it's actually just creating JavaScript logos rather than creative stuff. So not very clever, but it's got one mode of interface, and that's fine.

39:28 - Jonathan Phillips 
So just to clarify as well, the output, Ultimately, what the business owner wants is a roadmap, a blueprint of what to do. They will get this with a, let's call it a plan for argument's sake. And let's just say it's a PDF. That is the final output. But all the workshops, tasks, and activities are creating content. And then all these pieces of content will be then built into this final plan. And the final plan is something that could be printed out and presented let's just say for argument's sake. What will be useful as well is that as time goes on things change so if they go back to do a number of tasks and activities workshops that are halfway down the process it then changes a lot of other things and then the final output is changed but ultimately the final output is just a combination of all the other activities. So in Claude terms, you have your artifacts. So the artifacts are the output for each of the workshops, and then they will then culminate into one of the project documents, so to speak. So that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to create lots and lots of little pockets of data intelligence, knowledge that then contributes into a final plan and a roadmap for the business owners to take forward. But at the same time, they might just want to come in on one morning and say, I want a campaign idea. And then that will go straight into the framework at the right point and start to generate things again, which will then output in a different document.

41:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't know if that's for phase one, or do you see that as phase one?

41:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
Until we get an idea of the technology and the capabilities, we're going to have to work that out on the fly. Because if it's a difference between one month and eight months, that's a massive issue. So we need to know time scales, how long this is going to take.

41:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cost obviously as well and then we can start to build the phases in accordingly Okay, so if I look at this you've basically got the Workshop one Workshop two Workshop three and you have the You've got the output from every workshop.

42:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a sequence in the story framework. There is a sequence of workshops. And every workshop has an output. And then when you finish one workshop, you can go on to the next workshop. So JP, when you said there, workshop two, could that go back and change the output of workshop one?

42:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
It won't change it. But for example, if you then go through the process and you're on workshop 37, and you go back to workshop might 17, then alter things going forward. But we need to work out the logistics of how that works.

43:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So the output of one workshop feeds into the next workshop and so forth.

43:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

43:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ok. So if I go back to this for a second, This is just a single workshop with no relationship to any other workshop. This is just a standalone workshop for now. So if we were running that workshop today, a little bit like what I did was I set the context. I'm trying to explain what I'm doing. So one of the agents would be doing that. So we would have a facilitator agent that is running the workshop like Will started to do. Will open the meeting really well, set the context why we're here. So there's a Will facilitator type agent who runs the meeting. There's then two distinct phases where we're information gathering. We're asking questions. What are you doing this, da, da, da. And the workshop will have a list of those probes or questions. But ultimately, in the background, JP has told the agents, in this meeting, you're trying to get this learning. You're trying to achieve this outcome so that you can do the next step. So for example, when I go to any LLM and I say, right, create me a content plan for my health startup. If I don't ask another question, it'll just give me stuff. Ask me any clarifying questions so that you can best enable to answer this question, then we'll proceed. It will start asking me questions to a point where it's suddenly comfortable to answer the first question. Does that make sense? If you've used LLMs where you ask to say, ask clarifying questions. So the agents all know what it's trying to achieve here, because there will be a prompt in the background that says, when running the brand purpose workshop, the outcome or the output we're looking for is x. So everyone knows where we're trying to get to. But we don't have all the relevant information. So the first thing is the agents all asking questions to get information about the company. Like, why do you set up the business? Exactly why I asked Jonas. A little bit like a what, not a why. Then says, don't give me an answer about money because that's not useful for you. It's not a motive enough. So JP, could you ask more questions and pretend we're back in the workshop for a moment. What other questions would you ask Jonas? And just so everyone knows, we're sort of in the information gathering part of the workshop at the moment.

45:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. Well, we start off with what, why did you set the business up? Obviously again, money can't be a motivation. What gets you out of bed? What makes you content in life? What is it you're doing that makes you content?

45:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yes. Yeah. The, the unique problems that are presented by like subject matter expert, like there are fun problems to solve.

45:59 - Jonathan Phillips 
Okay. And, um, Do you have an idea of what you want to do with the business? Do you have an idea with the type of product and service you want to provide?

46:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could you clarify, like, what structure is or what...

46:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
So, I mean, we're talking holistically here. So what are you delivering to your customers?

46:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
technical solutions for non-technical people.

46:40 - Jonathan Phillips 
Okay and when you say that do you do you envisage having anything beyond the technology for them? So what are you trying to position your business as? So is it just someone who says here here's some technology or is it trying to is it trying to facilitate anything else?

47:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
So that's a leading question. So what I'm trying to get at is that the, what I'm trying to do is get you to say, I'm actually trying to give the customer what it wants, what it needs, rather than you say, I'm doing to provide technology tick box. It's a case of customer. Does this deliver what you had in mind? Does it deliver your, your vision, your, um, your concept? So it would be. What the workshop would do, it would sort of go back to you and go back to you and try and sort of get out of you exactly what it needs for a final statement, which is pretty much... Sorry Jonas, you're out of the workshop now, haven't you?

47:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because you're now, it seems like you're, I just want to, because I want to be really clear with the guys, it doesn't feel like you're, it feels like you've now talked about the workshop rather than being in the workshop.

48:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
I've got into guide mode. So yeah, I was guide bot then. So guide bot was then just advising you to try and modify some of the answers to try and drive you to a solution which it already has in the framework. So it's I don't expect a lot of the users to have any clue what they're doing, any clue. I mean, you're very clued up in what you do and what you've started with your business. But I expect a lot of these business owners to have never done business before, to have no clue what they're doing. I have to try and tease out of them the right answers to put in the framework. So there's a lot of iterative going backwards and forwards and saying, that's really good. I understand what you're saying. However, and it'll be this type of conversation in order to get that output at the end of the workshop.

48:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for example, Jonas, there's another question I would ask. And I'm going back into the workshop now, for example. I might say, so what harm comes to the world if your company didn't exist?

49:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think a lot of places in industries where there are very specialized workers which don't have the facility to develop using massive budgets.

49:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's hard to answer such a broad question.

49:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I'm hearing is that You're actually driven to help bring people's dreams to life that are reliant on technology, that they don't have the skills to do. So in a way, if I was going to be very emotive about this, you're a dream maker. You're trying to help people bring their dreams to life.

49:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

49:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right. So again, I played two different bot agents there. I was the question bot, but then I'm the imagination bot. I'm starting to pick up on these pink post-it notes that were nuggets that you were saying that were relevant. So there's going to be an agent that's listening and going, oh, that's interesting, that's interesting, that's interesting, that's interesting. And then there'll be another agent who's going, now that I'm hearing the entire conversation plus the nuggets, can I start imagining ideas? So in the ideation phase, what we're imagining, if you can see Where is this? Imagine this screen here. This is a really shitty wireframe, but hopefully it gets. Can you all see this, by the way?

50:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
We'Ve had the chat over here. And actually, that would be maybe a different color because it's a different agent. There's a whole chat. Oh, don't be green. I'll do that to be purple. There's a whole lot of conversations in the workshop over here. And at some point, we start producing at least two brand purposes. And what we're then saying to Jonas, hey, is it more the one on the left or the one on the right? So that wouldn't be there right now, right? Is it this or that? So let me take that box down. So there'd be now on the right-hand side a bit of a workshop going, hey, Jonas, As we're producing stuff, we're going to see stuff appear on the right-hand side. Tell us which one is more resonant for you. So I just said there, hey, you're a dream maker. You fix problems. As an example, I would be saying, which one of those is more resonant for you? And you might go, I'm a dream maker. Now we might do 20 of these. And you're going left, right. No, it's a bit of that, a bit of this one, that one, this one, that one, this one, that one, this one. And by giving us that feedback, the bot then, another bot, is actually, who's a copywriter, is taking all that feedback and then coming up with, you are a startup that brings to life people's dreams who are reliant on technology to do that, or something like that. So you know what? And again, you're the only one who gets to decide whether this is a good purpose statement or not. No one else does. But we understand the qualities of a good one. It's ultimately something that is a t-shirt that you're going to wear every day, and you've got to be comfortable.

52:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
When you get old enough and you have children, you get to choose what the names of your kids are. But your friends, if you want to call your kid Hitler, You might love that, but people are going to give you feedback saying, that's a really fucking stupid idea. That kid's going to get the shit kicked out of them in school. Or if the acronym of all of their letters of their name spells out something funny, you might like the name, but somebody will give you feedback to say, I'm not so sure that's the right, still ultimately your decision, and the same way for this. And then when we start this workshop, there may be like, one of the first things you might ask you is, hey, Do you have any brand guidelines? You've done anything like this before? Give us your website. And we would scrape all that information, maybe do some competitor analysis. And all of that comes into play to the agents who are coming up with this. So I mean, the stuff that myself and JP did there, we are not just taking the context of the conversation with you. We're taking every conversation we've had with you before, everything we know about startups, everything we know about you, the change of intonation in your voice, your body language, all of this at some level is feeding into us. For me to come up with fucking, you never mentioned the word dream maker. I just, something happened where I just came up with it.

54:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

54:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cause it felt emotional and it felt powerful. You might go, no, not interested. It's not that, or you might go, yes, it doesn't really matter. And at the end of the workshop, we have something that you're comfortable with and you're saying, yeah, that's it. Cool. And then that's it. That's the end of the workshop, right? Now, there's many, many workshops, and one workshop goes to another workshop.

54:26 - Jonathan Phillips 
So, for example, in this example here, if you Presented that part of your brand purpose was to be a dream maker then going forward with messaging and going forward with your campaigns It will be orientated towards you being a dream maker So for example, would it be better for you to say to your customers on your websites and your communications? I make your dreams come true, or I build the best line chain grass in the world bear in mind They don't know what that means or they don't know understand technology So what you're trying to do is is put some empathy and emotion And if you can get that emotional resonance with the customer, then all of a sudden you're communicating with them on their level. And that's what we try and do with the workshops. But as I say, the output then takes over into the next phase of workshops and activities to then build a bigger picture.

55:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if we go back to this, I'm going to just do these two, two, two. I'm going to put those as gray for now.

55:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the backlog, right? What do we need to do?

55:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Well, JP needs to be able to So with regards to the backlog, basically, from the looks of it, yeah, we are going to keep some of the minor important parts like authentication and all that stuff.

56:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm creating the backlog with an emphasis on the core product features, particularly the workshops.

56:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, what I'm trying to say to you is I'm creating the backlog in front of you at the moment. This is the backlog.

56:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Everything on that page is the backlog at an epic level.

57:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
It'S potentially harmful to create a text-based list disconnected from the customer journey. So what you're seeing on the screen here is the journey the customer goes on and the experience the customer has. In terms of workshop one, that epic is, I need to be able to run a workshop. In order to run a workshop, I need to be able to design it. And the workshop has a workshop, and it has an output. We've talked about what the user experience is. It's probably something like this. It's a multimodal window. Fine. So with the sales website and signing up, well, signing up implies authentication. So each of these boxes. Is the epic, and each of these epics then needs to get broken down into the lower level activities that you need to do in order to bring this stuff to life.

58:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you do this, I mean, the question is, so JP, are you going to take care of the sales website? Do you want the guys to do it, or are you going to do that?

58:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
I can do that. That's not a problem.

58:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So outside of scope, sign up. Yeah, OK. So we're now going to break this down. And I'm just going to create yellow tickets. So you need to have authentication.

58:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's not how you spell authentication. So I'm just going to call auth. I can't spell right now. You're going to have authentication. You're going to need to have user management. You're going to have to here. If I put this here, I'm going to just scale this out so we can stuff like this. So you're going to have to do the UX UI of this.

59:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Fucking hell. UX. Is that something you're going to do? Are you going to design the UX of this? Or how do you want to do that?

59:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well, I think it's a collaborative thing. I think I have an idea in my head, and I can draw that out. But if the technology doesn't facilitate what I want, then we have to compromise. So I'm more than happy to work on those, but obviously with you guys to bring it to reality.

59:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just putting IR around that, because that's going to be an iterative process. It's not going to be defined. So that's going to be very difficult to say a cost on that, because how long do you iterate on? Don't know. So if I was in your shoes, Jonas, what I would say, hey, I think the Claude interface, we understand what you've asked for. You want a multimodal interface. We've got these high-level wireframes here. Once we understand the exact scope and behavior in the first workshop, we will design a basic interface that allows that. We could over-engineer and polish that interface for the next 10 years. In the interest of doing something, as long as it's functional, as long as it doesn't break, I think we'll go with that in order to control the costs.

1:00:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So JP needs to be able to design a workshop. So basically here, you've got workshop creation, You've got Workshop, Outposts.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (21).txt"

Mon, Jul 15, 2024

0:01 - Eksno 
you reloaded the page, sorry. Of more like our position right now, and I would like more have a dynamic meeting where we try to like figure out what's best for that and how we can best move forward where there's as little overhead as possible. Sure. With addendums for like small features and changes in vision and all of that. So just an open discussion, basically. And then tomorrow, I'd like to have a meeting more with everyone where we more finalize everything.

0:39 - Eksno 
So the document I sent you is the original design spec that was sent along with the contracts?

0:46 - Eksno 
Sure.

0:48 - Eksno 
At that point, when we evaluated how long the project would take and estimated everything, it was more of a POC, no user authentication or anything like that. It was just spearheads into the AI bots.

1:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, this was not a proof of concept. This was definitely never a proof of concept. Those proof of concept words were never used, not for ADAPT. For IntelliAgent, yes, but never for ADAPT.

1:16 - Eksno 
Yeah. So you can see that there's no user management or user authentication or anything like that within the design specification?

1:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can see that's missing. That's a concern. OK.

1:44 - Eksno 
Yeah.

1:48 - Eksno 
Of course, like a lot has changed since then, especially with the vision of the projects.

1:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you, can you quick, okay, if you're going to be saying things have changed, I don't think we can use generic terms like vision. Where specifically do you feel has changed and in what way?

2:07 - Eksno 
I can give examples. For example, the moveEatSleepMineTracker. We have here in the science pack, it was supposed to measure time distance for move, meal calories for eat, sleep was like very specific items. Meanwhile, now it's more of a dynamic tracker.

2:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Along with that, we're going to be building the to-do list into If we're going to go through this, we need to stick to one point and get one point clear before we go to the next one. So move, eat, sleep, mind is exactly this, what's changed. Because in my view, what we're building is exactly this.

2:54 - Eksno 
What has changed is it's more of a dynamic tracker where users will be able to add their own items now.

3:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's a to-do list to track their own tasks. Eat, move, sleep, mind is exactly this. So let's just talk about sleep, move, mind. You're using the words dynamic and stuff like that. That's sort of irrelevant. The UI that I've created, even in the mobile, has buttons for time and distance for move. So this is the same. I don't see any delta there.

3:30 - Eksno 
OK.

3:34 - Eksno 
One aspect then is the onboarding graph, for example. None of the structure behind workshops for coaching sessions that are supposed to be lasting 30 60 minutes are included inside the design spec. Inside the design spec, we, like, of course, were originally planning to have a one agent model, which took care of kind of the entire day and was more of a generic mentor coach at the same time, and so for all of these workflows that we are planning now.

4:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can, where's that document gone?

5:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can see the coaching aspect is an enhancement.

5:25 - Eksno 
Yeah. So of course, we want to collaborate with you. We're investing a lot with you. We want to succeed with you. So this isn't an attack or anything, it's more just trying to get aligned on the best way to move forward.

5:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

5:44 - Eksno 
One of my main proposals would be for the next month, you can basically at the same rate, hire the entire group more so on a, instead of having an end goal, more just moving forward with on the spot estimations for each feature and aligning with you as we see appropriate.

6:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what you're talking about, you want to move to a time and materials rather than you guys getting a fixed price quote.

6:10 - Eksno 
Yes, because this project is very, like, we don't know the problem until we have one use case, and then the problem changes, if that makes sense.

6:24 - Eksno 
And because of the inconvenience that's causing, especially you guys were offering all the new developers and me plus the four developers time for the same rate per week, 1000 per week. But the benefit this gives us is that me, as a developer, and them will have to worry less about getting the perfect design spec down in any addendums that we might add for coaching. And we can just worry about doing what's best for that.

6:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, regardless of the contract being fixed price or time materials, one would expect that you would always have the best interest of your client. So that doesn't really feel like a thing to say.

7:15 - Eksno 
We have the best interest of you, which is why we've been working like we have, but I've kind of realized a lot of the aspects which we haven't put into the original estimations are things that we're now starting to work on. But from a business perspective, my motivation is misaligned with Adapt now, which I don't think is correct. I'm motivated to halt improvements on areas I think we should be improving on Adapt because of the original design spec, because it's misaligned in some areas. Areas where I have to put an overhead time. I don't want to be misaligned with your motivations or with that.

7:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I get what you're saying. And there's, um, you know, for, for a startup that's pre revenue. One of the reasons we went with you guys was because you were, you know, willing to give a, a controlled cost. Um, we can't also have, uh, just an open ended, We just build, and we keep on building, and we keep on building. So there's a difference between what I would say. Sorry, I'm going to put this on, because I'm getting cold. There's a difference between clarification.

8:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's probably devils in the details of an LMS that we haven't talked about, but that's sort of real clarification of stuff. Versus a new feature like coaching. And I get the sense. So I understand the request that obviously you can't have an infinite scope going into a fixed price contract. I'm fully cognizant of that. I also can't move to complete TNM because I don't know if this is going to turn into a hundred grand, a million pounds or we're 1000 pounds away from finishing. So that also doesn't work. So what I would expect is a greater, I think you use the word misalignment. I don't think it's misalignment. I think it's scope management. OK. I think we should be talking about whatever we need to talk about. But I think there has to be a tighter coupling, which says, OK, as an example, that coaching is a great feature. I can see the value in it.

10:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's not currently in the scope. Do you want to bring it in, and therefore the scope increases and the budget increases? Or do you want to swap that out for something else?

10:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

10:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
So ultimately, there's just, you know, The original contract buys a number of things.

10:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's say it's 50, whatever that means. If I come up with 20 new things and we take out 20 old things, then it's still 50. It shouldn't really matter. But for example, The UI has simplified a lot because we're not going to be doing a complex website and stuff like that in terms of screens. We think, anyway. We don't know.

10:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I think definitely the coaching is different. I think you guys changing technologies is not something I'd expect that I would cover.

11:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think there's a huge amount that we're doing in ADAPT that I think I'm also being influenced by IntelliAgent so that IntelliAgent will benefit from there. So I'm going to speak to those guys about incorporating some of their budget into my budget or whatever, some of the ADAPT budget gets picked up by IntelliAgent, we'll figure that out. So, I mean, ultimately, we'll find a solution. I think you're right to bring this up. I don't want to move to a pure TNM because that just, it's uncontrolled cost, but also your side, you can't have a infinite, a floating scope going into a fixed budget. That also doesn't work. You guys will just break and you can't work that way either.

11:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think what we just need to hear is a greater, what's called, just a greater control on the scope management and getting clarifications on that. I've worked extensively in the past, and one of the reasons why the agile project or the sort of AI project manager concept, I think, is really paramount in software delivery, because how long is a piece of string? How long does something take? And again, Part of why we would use any company is there has to be some relevance of experience that you have to be able to say, right, that. So I'm scoping out for that Africa opportunity. I'm scoping out the entire project today and tomorrow. I've got very little requirements, but I've done an awful lot of this stuff already in the past.

12:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll probably be plus or minus 50% at this stage, but it gives us a ballpark. And then what I'll do is I'll manage those clients as we get more information, that plus or minus 50 will either go north or south, it will go up or down. And we manage accordingly. And at some point that will become intolerable, either in terms of scope or cost. And we have a conversation, which is what we're having right now. So I think this is the right conversation to have. What I need to understand is, and then this is sort of where you know, I was sort of pushing George into, you need to have a backlog, right? A backlog will have 50 items in it. If we add a new item, Cuan, do you want to take something out or do you want to leave this in and increase the budget? And by the way, it's going to be an extra three-man days, five-man days, four-man days, whatever it is. You brought, and again, it might be two and it might be six, but we're going to, we'll sort of budget for five, let's say. It'd be somewhere between three and six. Budget for five, are you okay with that? And when we get to it, then obviously we'll figure out, because it might be two and it might be eight, it'll be in and around five. And that should be the conversation that we have, that we have a very clear backlog. We understand what's in scope versus potentially new. And you can do this very simply in Trello. You have an agreed backlog, you have a parking lot or new ideas, anything new that comes up. Now, new is not clarification. That's different, right? There's a difference in new feature versus clarifying or something. And then, yeah, we basically say, well, that coaching thing, that's pretty big. That's worth three of these things. We can take three out, and you can move one in. What do you want to do? I completely agree that user authentication isn't here. It's sort of, I'll be very honest, it's sort of assumed I was, you know, not there. It's sort of an assumed feature at this sort of level that use it. Coaching totally understand this move completely. Yeah. Um, so yeah, it's, it's, um, I think there's some project management missing basically.

15:08 - Eksno 
Yeah.

15:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, Now, the question is, you as a highly skilled engineer doing project management, does it feel like a very good use of your time?

15:30 - Eksno 
Yeah.

15:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
And obviously, as you get bigger, as you said, you're starting to notice the management overhead.

15:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So figure out how I can potentially help with that in terms of working with the team or stuff like that. But for me, I think having a very clear backlog with a list of items and then seeing who's working on what and what's in progress versus what's testing, what's ready for me to test. I'm happy to sort of take you through how I would manage that on Trello. This is a very simple version of the tooling. And we can get aligned on that. That might be very useful, then you guys should be running your standups from that. And then you get to line or use that other project management tool that George talked about, because it's all I mean, basically, it's just cards on a page. It's nothing too difficult.

16:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

16:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I would propose is as a way forward is to break create the backlog. Create a very clear list of the features that are missing from the contract, like user authentication versus ones that are new, like coaching.

16:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Excuse me. So we basically get a real position and an aligned agreement between us as terms of what is in scope, what's extra scope, and then how do we want to manage that expectations. So in essence, what you end up doing is what's called CAP T&M.

17:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Using your experience to say, right, if you want this new thing, this new widget, that widget's going to be a week, and a week's going to cost you x. Fine, cool. So that's for me to decide whether I want to do that. It's not reasonable for you to just say yes to everything at a fixed price. It doesn't work that way. Obviously, it would be great for me if it did, but I'm also quite realistic. I've been in your shoes many times, so I understand how it works. Our preference is to have a longer term relationship with you guys than trying to take the piss and break you guys. But also, it's very different if I'm going to a, you know, a 300 million revenue startup in the banking space and able to do some work with you guys, we'll be charging them very different rates. And then, again, the idea would be to charge them some rates, but to keep some money, whatever profit share, to try and build other products that we can then potentially sell in the future, or this thing in Africa, is very different from us sort of paying this out of our own pocket as a startup with zero revenue. They're just different problems. Don't think for a moment that just because you're charging clients more money that it gets easier. It gets worse. Because when people pay you money, they feel they can treat you however they wish. And they will keep asking and asking and asking and asking. It's a silly game, right? Because it just doesn't work. It doesn't work long term.

18:49 - Eksno 
So I think at least something that we can do is try to move the design spec out of the contracts and into something like Trello, like you mentioned, because I think it's going to be moving around, even if it's just switching out features a fair amount.

19:13 - Eksno 
However, we're currently working on estimating most of the things, or Haznaeen and Shenmei is looking at the past design spec and comparing it to their interpretation of your current vision. And trying to get that down on paper so that tomorrow we'll have more on paper estimations for each of those features. We can move it into Trello. Do you want to compare with you?

19:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Or I mean, the only issue with Trello is that it doesn't have any sort of size, like small, medium, large on it so that you can probably do it as a plug-in. But I don't know whether the other tool that George had suggested at the start, I forgot what it's called. Plane.so.

20:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, Plane.so, yeah.

20:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

20:09 - Eksno 
Which one do you guys want to use?

20:12 - Eksno 
I think George would probably prefer Plane.so, but Trello is a lot easier to just hop into, whereas Plane.so, you've probably used it a thousand times to Azure DevOps. It's very similar to Azure DevOps. Where it's got like several layers.

20:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, if it's, if it's got the ability to have your, have code sent into it, then that's fine. But let's, let's make a decision, which one we're going to use and then to start using it. Um, from an interface point of view, it has a, it has a task board. So, you know, whatever, I'm happy that works. Um, what I'd advocate is that you are, you guys do this, if you're going to do it on a document, on a mural or whatever it is that you make this visible, so I can start seeing the progress that you guys are coming up with today, because the word vision is very generic. And so I want to understand that we're not going down into minutiae. And there's a difference between new features, coaching, totally get it, versus the chatbot, versus clarification, user management.

21:26 - Eksno 
Just to clarify on one point you made earlier, we never intended to charge you for our tech shifts. The only disadvantage we saw for you was that the project would be like the delivery date would be a week later. So yeah, and I still don't plan on trying to charge you for that. However, we do it logically, but whether it's like the last week we don't charge you or whatever, we never plan to charge you for that. That was a hit for us more so.

21:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. We'll figure this stuff out. I think this is just part of you guys working with clients. Yeah.

22:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
I would hope that I'm going to be reasonable because I've been in your shoes and I understand the challenge and there's always this balance, right? Between trying to, you know, you can't, you can't specify everything upfront because if you do, then you'll, you'll spend three months in requirements and not actually building anything. And then as you build stuff, you go, Ooh, this is really interesting. That will be better if we did that better if we did that. So I guess stuff changes a hundred percent. So, um, What I'd advocate is, I mean, I've got time today. I reckon we could get this cleared up in less than an hour if we were all on a call together and just started doing a workshop and all started going into playing. Everyone just creates items and tickets because then we're saying, yes, no, no, yes, here's why, da-da-da-da-da. It also builds more knowledge about the project and what it is and what it's not.

23:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm happy to do that if you guys want to, but also you may not do that.

23:15 - Eksno 
Yeah. I first saw us doing that probably tomorrow.

23:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

23:19 - Eksno 
Although I was planning on allocating a bit more than an hour. Yeah.

23:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, it takes an hour.

23:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
It takes an hour.

23:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, it depends on how you want to run it. Right. Like if you're going to go down into task level, That's going to get very messy, very confusing, very level. You need to start high and then you drill down. And then at some point, the drilling down doesn't add any value. And then you stop. I mean, I think the actual fundamental feature list on this project isn't very big. Less than 20.

24:05 - Eksno 
Complex part of that for us is the AI part is kind of one feature, but it's a feature which is very complicated and that is a lot of underlying structure. When we made the original design spec, it was definitely a lot harder to estimate. But I think it's easier now to create a proper feature list with all the experience we have working with it and the fact that we're using a line graph, which divides the AI data into graphs, which can individually be estimated much more easily.

24:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you need to separate out the user features from implementation.

24:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm talking about features initially, getting very clear on the scope that needs to be delivered. The second part of that question then is the how you deliver that, and the breakdown into technical tasks to deliver on those features. So there could be one feature that you thought was five tasks, could now be 20 tasks. So that I understand. But you have to get a line, first of all, on the feature set from a user's perspective, and then look at the the implementation.

25:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it's the feature set that I'm referring to that we should be able to do in less than an hour.

25:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

25:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
That would be the thing for me. If I was you, I would do that today with all of us so that we're clear. Because that's the ask, right? That's the scope. How you then implement it, that's an internal conversation for you guys. I can't really be involved in that because it's not for me to design how technically you build something.

25:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're going technical first, that is the, you know, I don't like to use the word very often, but that is the wrong approach. Yeah, I agree. You have to go outcome based first, get clear on the outcomes that you want.

26:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not insanely long or difficult to do.

26:07 - Eksno 
Yeah. It's just being explicit enough with the outcome definitions. Because with the AI bot, we'll need to outline which workshops it'll be able to run or the coaching sessions, like the onboarding.

26:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the coaching session, I think, is a good call. I think that is basically, it is a new feature. And I think we've got to be careful about how much of this has been done for IntelliAgent as a dot. And actually say, listen, it's a 20% increase in at least taking ADAPT into thought process in terms of how we build this. And then IA basically benefits, and I'll figure out what the charge is between IntelliAgent and myself.

27:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Or you might go, it doesn't make a difference. They're identical. I'm like, OK, fine. We'll figure it out.

27:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
So can you guys make a decision whether you want to use Trello or Plane? And then what I'll do is I'll start working on the backlog from a customer point of view in terms of what I think we need to do.

27:22 - Eksno 
Yeah, that sounds good. If we're also going to be creating a backlog, should I create two different boards or one board?

27:31 - Eksno 
There should only be one backlog.

27:34 - Eksno 
Yeah. I mean, more or less, we're sketching it out independently.

27:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I don't think you should be sketching up anything from a feature point of view. So what we should be doing is you have the high-level features that get broken down into sub-features or whatever. And then at some point, you have technical implementation tasks. And therefore, you can see as you're working on these technical tasks how it's delivering an outcome. And that outcome is part of this bigger bigger outcome.

28:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's one backlog that's linked. Now, I don't know whether Plane does. Do you have a name? Do you guys already have Plane?

28:24 - Eksno 
After this call, I'm going to set it up and run through it as fast as possible and just see if it has all the features we need, make sure that it's running.

28:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just trying to think here. There is adapt payments agent projects.

28:48 - Eksno 
Yeah. George was also like assisting me with a lot of the project management tasks. And then he went to the us for the wedding while we were recruiting people. So I've had to take care of everything, business, everything, project management and implementation and everything currently.

29:08 - Eksno 
Just to give you some perspective.

29:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. Display. Where is that? OK.

29:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not really seeing. Where is the board?

29:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I have a project called Adapt Release 1. It's got issues.

29:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
I figured it out now. Fine.

29:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
I have an Adapt one here. How do I get you into this project?

29:56 - Eksno 
I'm not sure what my account is. It's been a while since I've been on Plane.slo.

30:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I've given you the link there. We can move everything from Trello to this if you guys want to work in here. We just get this link.

30:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, I can start. I'll start populating it this morning after I've got to take the dog for a walk. But yeah, we'll figure it out.

30:20 - Eksno 
Yeah. So how do you want to move forward with the contract then?

30:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
We can't do anything until we understand what the increase in scope is. Got to get the backlog sorted out. Until the backlog's sorted out, there isn't a conversation.

30:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

30:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because I don't know what the order of magnitude is.

30:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

30:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I would imagine that we'll probably take the rest of this week to sort this out, but we just continue with business as usual. We'll figure it out. Um, I need to have a, uh, some sort of view on, on hero TMO. Um, he seems to be working on adapt and hero. I'm just wondering whether if you just let them lose on hero and figure it out with the charts.

31:04 - Eksno 
Cool.

31:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, if you can just do an update every sort of half day, that would be really useful just to understand where we're going with that and then figure out what the charge is, that'd be fine.

31:15 - Eksno 
I think he's just trying to get it up and running right now, as is, or with a few updates to the packages.

31:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ok. Yeah, obviously, good to know whether we're going to head into a dead. I mean, technically, do you think it's still feasible to get that running? Like, it's just a matter of updating stuff?

31:37 - Eksno 
He's had two to three days.

31:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:41 - Eksno 
So yeah, I should get it up and running within two to three days. Yeah. Otherwise one of the benefits I was thinking about related to the like time and management or what was the time and resources? Time and materials. Time and materials over The specific projects, of course, with some combination of detailed backlog, was that it would be much easier for me to just delegate someone to something like Hero TMO. And because we're just charging you per pair of programmer or for the team, we wouldn't have to worry too much about that being outside the scope of Adapt or something like that. So it could get moving a lot faster. But of course, the disadvantage of that is less guarantee.

32:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, for Hero, because it's just, it's a number of days, the outcome is turn it on. And I get it's, it's unpredictable. So just, and it's not going to be, it's not going to be a month. So TNM is manageable for me. So just go right. Just, just hit that on a product project. That's, that's very different because it's, it's an unknown end date.

32:54 - Eksno 
Yeah. Okay.

33:05 - Eksno 
Yeah.

33:12 - Eksno 
I'm wondering if there's some in-between, then, between time and materials and defined scope in contracts, where we can do the scope outside of the contract, but it's still defined. And at each moment in time, there's a promised result for a promised amount of time.

33:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
That'S sort of what I refer to is that once you look at the backlog, there's bits that you've done before and you're comfortable with and say, yeah, LMS, that's very little innovation. That's very easy to confine. That's going to be this. Other bits are going to be, right, OK, it's something between this and that because it's innovation. Fine. And then we have something that's clarified, which is included. And then there's something that's new, which is a conversation.

34:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
But you guys need to be tighter on how you manage me, basically, and your customer in terms of managing your internal resources and the scope of the backlog. Sorry, the scope of the project. That balance has to be controlled by you guys.

34:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

34:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Which is basically what you're doing now, so it's fine.

34:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

34:27 - Eksno 
Yeah, if you have any resources or any recommendations for me, just send me on Discord.

34:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
related to this? 20 experience.

34:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not straightforward. I mean, I'm being, you know, there's no point anyone being overly dogmatic about this because we'll just fall out of bed and there's no value in that. So invariably, Every client is going to want a fixed price and every supplier is going to want time materials. That's the equation that's always existed and always will exist. Now, in a really big organization, T&M is ideal, but it's a huge amount of trust for companies to do. And so that's a big challenge, but there are, what we call capped T&M, which is sort of this hybrid approach where you're basically saying, these bits we're really confident about, and it's going to cost you this amount, and we're pretty happy to take that as a fixed price. This bit is innovation, so we're going to have to do some stuff, and then we'll have to spend maybe two days to get it to a capped price to understand it, and then As you're doing stuff, as new stuff comes up, you just need to manage the scope of what's coming in versus out. And say, well, you can take stuff out. You can put stuff in what you want to do. It's sort of that same.

36:16 - Eksno 
Yeah. So yeah, I'm also thinking about how we should manage this after Adapts and after Intelligent when potentially we'll be working with you guys.

36:27 - Eksno 
handle the difference between where we can do project-based and where we're doing innovation, as you mentioned, where we don't know the problem.

36:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I'm not following.

36:39 - Eksno 
Yeah, I'm also trying to wrap my head around how we should manage the contracts and how we should manage charging organizations after working with you guys, potentially in a partnership with you guys afterwards.

36:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, you're It depends, right? It depends on every engagement. It's slightly different. I think you've got to be really careful about... Yeah, I mean, in one way, working with a startup like us is really difficult and really easy. And same working with a bigger client. There's bits that's really easy and there's bits that's really difficult.

37:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Data, for example, when you go into big companies, data is pivotal to what you do, and it could take you six weeks to get data.

37:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the clock is ticking, right? Not necessarily, you know, the clients go in, well, we're six weeks into the project. And I was like, yeah, but you haven't given us your data yet. I don't give a fuck. It's six weeks into the project. So you've got to manage expectations. There's different challenges in different organizations.

37:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
And most clients are really shit at telling you what they want. They're just not good at it. They're not good at giving feedback. But we can pick that up as we go along. We have other conversations. I think for now, focus on getting this backlog sorted and getting clear on what the order of magnitude changes.

38:13 - Eksno 
Yeah, sounds good.

38:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. I'm around for the rest of the day. If you want to do, let me know if you want to use plan. As soon as you want to use plan or Trello, let me know, and then I'll start working on the backlog from my side.

38:24 - Eksno 
Yeah, sounds good. I'll get my plane set up as soon as possible and try to get that backlog done.

38:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Are you going to do it or do you want me to do it?

38:38 - Eksno 
I need to set up my account and go through and make sure that they provide the ability to have time estimations and what's it called? The hierarchical tasks, so that we can start with more of the ethics, go down to the features, all of that.

38:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it would be good. If we can do hierarchy, I think that would be really good.

39:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Time.

39:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, yeah.

39:09 - Eksno 
You can put time in the title.

39:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cycle parent labels. I mean, you could just do small, medium, large. I wouldn't go near time. Time is a myth.

39:30 - Eksno 
I'd like to say that, but you also need a date when you can expect it to be finished.

39:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but you do things abstractly by small, medium, large, and then eventually what you'll have is that we can do a number of smalls. A medium is the same as two smalls and a large is the same as five smalls, something like that. And then you know that we do an average 10 smalls a week, therefore you divide everything out. And that's basically, that's the way you do estimates.

39:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
But you have to figure out what a thing is for you guys. And so we say, right, this piece of work we've all worked on from now on, that refers to a small piece of work. Maybe you'll figure out what small is. It could be half a day. It could be 3 quarters of a day a day. It's generally under a day, a small. It's something that you can definitely do in a day. And then you go, right, OK. It's sort of a small and then you have references you go oh this is very little thing we did that that sounds really similar to that okay so that's a small okay fine so then that's how you have your small mediums and large you basically work yeah you have references so as you as you now have a team just pick a piece of work that you guys have done and say right we're going to call that a small that's our reference story for a small and everything balances off that I wouldn't do time time is far too scary and subjective. It eventually translates to time, right? But you don't work in time. It doesn't work for people.

41:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
And you have to have a different story that you put a stake in the ground and everyone understands it.

41:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Same way, you can say to somebody, how long is a football game? More or less 90 minutes. How does everyone in the world know that? They've just watched games. They understand it. They've heard about it.

41:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. A little bit of extra time, but broadly speaking, it's 90 minutes. I think if you want to be precise about things, that's where you could end up spending and having a debate for the next five years about how long a football game is. It doesn't add value, though. Broadly saying it's 90 minutes is sufficient. Yeah. It never really finishes early. It goes somewhere between four minutes over. Like four minutes out of 90 sort of irrelevant.

41:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

42:00 - Eksno 
Yeah.

42:04 - Eksno 
I'll get started on that then.

42:06 - Eksno 
Okay, cool. Let me know. I'm around all day.

42:08 - Eksno 
Yeah. Sounds good. I'll see you.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (22).txt"

0:04 - Jorge Lewis 
This sure isn't, you know.

0:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

0:17 - Eksno 
Is he going to be joining for the next meeting or just this spring?

0:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Probably just at least two and then at least one of me and you and then ideally in May.

0:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
JP's coming back in I Think we were going we're wrapping up anyways Well, no, we're not gonna do like 20 minutes now on figuring out what's next Yeah.

1:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. I mean, we could do that as well, but ideally Cuan was here, but yeah, I mean, it's reported, so.

1:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I can't do Monday. You're not around unless like, what are you going to, if we don't, if we wait till Wednesday to have the conversation, that's just like, it just feels like we're super slow.

1:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Tomorrow I would have time around, uh, around 12 PM VST.

1:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know what that is in the UK.

1:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, that's your, that's your time.

1:37 - Jorge Lewis 
BSTSU.

1:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, British Standard Time.

1:42 - Eksno 
12 PM or AM?

1:43 - Eksno 
12 PM.

1:45 - Eksno 
Military time. What's that in military? The 12 is always confusing.

1:48 - Eksno 
Is it 12 or 24? Noon. Okay.

1:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I have, I have a couple, I think I have two interviews booked and that's all, but I can move them to what I learned.

2:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's just get first aligned at a high level, um, in terms of, uh, let me just do this. I'm going to just start doing this now.

2:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you can see my screen.

2:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so I do have another meeting to get to. So yeah, it was 20 minutes. Keep it sharp.

2:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, well, you can drop and I'll work with Jonas.

2:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. That works.

2:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:54 - Jorge Lewis 
All right. Cool. Um, I'm going to check if read AI leaves, because I do want to do the recording. So nice seeing you, Kevin. Hopefully, I'll see you tomorrow sometime, or at least really soon. Yeah, no worries.

3:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Have a good day, guys. Cool. So when I'm testing it, let me delete this, and I'll just show you what I'm doing.

3:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I might go, I just walked five kilometers. Let's just say that happens there.

3:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I'm still learning, by the way, how to test this.

3:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
So great. Let me update your check-in with the five kilometer walk. I don't understand why it said AI missing name. I don't know why it said give me a moment. And then why?

3:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is the congratulations on the back of that. But I don't understand why it said give me a moment. And then let's get your check-in updated. Did you consume any calories? If so, how many? So I would then go into Admin, go to Chats, go to Kuhn Mulligan. And I would say that's a bad response.

4:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
I would say, while I have you here, how many calories have you had today? I don't need to do the what was wrong. It doesn't work.

4:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Go back, delete.

4:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just walked five kilometers.

4:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So why is it doing this? Give me a moment. Do you know that?

5:11 - Eksno 
The message you reviewed was the one Andrew gave me a moment ago. There are two different parts here, the collector and the coach, and then one back to the collector. You reviewed the final message, which you can see it, actually listen to the review you said, while I have you here, how many calories have you had today? The reason it's saying me a moment is probably just due to bad prompting. Currently, it's thinking of itself as an assistant that's interacting with tools for you instead of a coach that just happens to be able to have the same data. It's talking as if it's a tool rather than a person.

5:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so if I looked here, I just wrote 5k that says user human. These are all AIs. It thinks these two are human.

5:58 - Eksno 
And this is human, but the type is just for internal debugging. You don't have to think about the type. The name is the more important one.

6:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why, if I'm type human, why is this type human? This should always be type AI.

6:15 - Eksno 
like internal data structure that we use and giving it the type of human is a trick when working with multi-agents.

6:27 - Eksno 
It's just for our own testing. You don't have to care about the type. That's just for us to verify things are working correctly. The most important thing is the name.

6:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
I do get these errors all the time popping up to do with a listener indicated asynchronous response by returning true.

6:47 - Eksno 
I'm not sure what that error is, but just generally in web development, you'll just have console errors all the time. Like if you open Google Docs, there will probably be console errors.

7:06 - Eksno 
I don't know.

7:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

7:08 - Eksno 
I say, yeah. I want to see if the give me a moment is some unique message or if it's part of the original message.

7:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, say that again. Your audio is a bit difficult to hear.

7:17 - Eksno 
Let me try to change it. You may be.

7:24 - Eksno 
Tell me if you can hear an echo, Jorge, in the background now. Is my audio better?

7:28 - Eksno 
Yeah, that's much better. OK.

7:34 - Eksno 
In the review interface, could you check if give me a moment is actually a unique message, or if it's just a new paragraph in the same message?

7:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's giving me three updates here, which is...

7:47 - Eksno 
Oh, there seems like there's a lot of delay in the microphone. You responded to what I said like 20 seconds after.

7:55 - Eksno 
What do you want me to do here? Give me a moment to click bad response.

8:15 - Eksno 
Yeah, you can see that that's actually one message. So it's just bad prompting. You could remove the give me a moment, then Control-A, Control-C into the improved response, and it may improve.

8:27 - Eksno 
Yeah.

8:44 - Eksno 
I wouldn't include that I have recorded your 5km walk for you if you wanted to not say stuff like that. Just, great job, Cuan. Could be enough.

8:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, no, no. I wanted to say that.

8:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, OK.

8:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Because you're saying, I've done some. I've now taken. So you've done your 5k. I've recorded that for you. OK. Yeah, we absolutely want that.

9:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

9:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I do this now.

9:25 - Eksno 
Still saying give me a moment.

9:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so this is the bit I don't understand why the good response, bad response sometimes doesn't seem to take effect. But if I go into the prompt, then it would.

9:48 - Eksno 
So I'm assuming if I go into the chat, Yeah, the prompt will be a more reliable way to guarantee an effect outside of specific scenarios where reviews excel. I think over time reviews will be much better because currently there's a very limited number of reviews, which means when it's fetching examples, I think it's fetching five examples, and that's basically how many reviews currently exist, minus a bit, so it may be getting totally irrelevant examples. But if you build it up to 50 reviews, then all the examples should be pretty relevant.

10:24 - Eksno 
So which AI is this one, the top two?

10:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
I wanted to change either of these. I would go into the relevant prompt box, but I don't understand these.

10:38 - Eksno 
Yeah, I see. The review probably didn't work, as you can see that name missing or AI missing name bug has happened. So I think the review got assigned to an error agent, basically.

10:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
So which one of these? I don't know if you're following me.

10:57 - Eksno 
I think it's the collector. Because the collector is the one that updates data.

11:02 - Eksno 
But this one says collector. Why is this one saying list?

11:06 - Eksno 
I'm not sure. That's something I'll have to go into, look at the logs and run myself to fix.

11:15 - Eksno 
I heard from Jorge that it's a lang chain bug. Sometimes it just doesn't get the correct name, and we'll have to look into why. OK.

11:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right, so if I do here. So yeah, I mean, what I'd expect to do, this is very transactional about collecting the data. What I'd like to try and do is turn this into a coaching session. So what I want to do is like, hey, just want to check in with you proactively. It would be nice to, I know I can just say, Just to type in, hi, and say, great to hear from you. I'd like to try and do some stuff. How are you finding today? I see from your profile that you've entered in your eating, but you didn't tell me, did you get a walk today? So what I don't know at the moment is what's in the database for my profile versus not. So if I go in here. If you can see, where is it here? If I go back into Table Editor, and I go to Profile, it's not coming. So where would the check-in, where is the, so in my view, in, I think it's actually in this table here. So these are check-ins for me. I've got distance walks, calories, and watch video. And they're all null. So even if I run that again, I've just checked in, and nothing's been written to my profile.

12:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can't hear you. You're on mute.

13:01 - Eksno 
2 to finish a check-in, just filling out all the data as it expects it.

13:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
1 Yes, I watched the video.

13:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Five colors.

13:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh.

13:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

13:50 - Eksno 
Some little bug there.

13:52 - Eksno 
Yeah, I haven't gotten that one before gateway time Did you reload and try to send it again?

14:04 - Eksno 
Should I delete the chat?

14:08 - Eksno 
Um, yeah, I think so it probably started that Yeah, we're currently working on the error handling so that it doesn't just break the chat. 120.

14:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it's crashed again.

14:59 - Eksno 
And this time it was just an error.

15:02 - Eksno 
We'll check that.

15:11 - Eksno 
Yeah, so I think I can get to that afterwards, debugging and fixing that, but get back on track with where we're aligned, where we're moving forward, definitely fixing those errors. And then afterwards, I'm thinking we're going to move over to the high level graph so that you can engage with it at different times of day, which induces different behavior so that currently it's just entering a check-in, the check-in state immediately, always. So you're always in the middle of a check-in. We want to take it out of that, where there's a general shedding mode, where you can enter the check-in. And depending on what time of day, it doesn't ask for every single field like it is currently.

15:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I go in here, so you're going to do update the graph. To allow chat engagement at any time.

16:26 - Eksno 
The most recent picture I sent in the dev is more like showing how it's going from just being the check-in box to being like a high-level graph where it can go between different states. So yeah, that's what we're thinking of working on next. Onboarding was just kind of an example of one of those states that we'll cut out. Now it'll be just the shedding state and the check-in state. And then hopefully have a smooth transition between the states where the user can, for example, just update one item in their check-in. Not one day they wake up, like, say, I slept. I went to sleep at this time and woke up at this time.

17:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, how difficult is it to be dynamic with the things that they're checking in on? At the moment, it seems hard-coded to distance walked calories and sleep hours, but we might want to change that. Well, I do. Well, sleep is wrong. We want to track distance and time for sleep or for walking now, but we want to change something else. Is there a way that that's configured? By me, or does it always have to be hard-coded by you guys?

17:28 - Eksno 
Yeah, I was thinking of that, changing the format in the database from being the columns that each have their own data type to just being one JSON binary that you'll be able to modify in the admin interface, the schema of this JSON binary of what is the data and what are the data types. And then in the tool, we'll have to prompt it with that. Of course, this has all of that overhead, but I think that overhead will be worth it, because I imagine that the check-in data and the data points that you want will change a fair bit over time.

18:12 - Eksno 
And by that way, you'll be able to have a page in the admin panel where you can edit the check-in items that it'll try to get. Maybe even you can enter the time range on when it should be trying to get those items and things like that.

18:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So realistically, how long do you think it is for the next release, because if you need four or five days and that's fine, but I just want to set expectations in terms of there's not really much point in me testing anymore until those errors are fixed and we get the next sort of set of capabilities.

18:54 - Eksno 
Effectively, each release is every day, because we're constantly pushing updates, constantly pushing bug fixes. So yeah, to have a next release, that'll be more dependent. It'll be more estimations of when we'll have a feature, if that makes sense.

19:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So that's sort of what I meant. But when do you think you'll have that sort of chatting feature?

19:21 - Eksno 
Just chatting feature?

19:25 - Eksno 
I figure just by the end of next week, yeah.

19:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, by the end of the week, during the week?

19:34 - Eksno 
Hopefully during, but yeah, during next week, yeah.

19:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, well then that's fine, man. You guys just work on that. If you get stuff during the week, let us know. We'll continue to sort of test it a little bit here and then and see how it goes.

19:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

19:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. I think that's it. I think we're good to go.

20:00 - Eksno 
Yeah, perfect. What do you think about the check-in items? Should we just take the short approach currently of just updating the base points to correcting the sleep time? Or the more overhead approach of making it JSON and then exposing it in the Admin panel?

20:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
And what's the efforts associated with that?

20:31 - Eksno 
A figure of probably two days.

20:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, we know that we want to have the ability for the user to also add their own items to track anyway.

20:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's true.

20:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

20:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
And if we have that, we can tweak those things and get it right without having to bother you guys. So if it's only a day or two, I think I would invest in doing that because it's just going to allow us to do more things without having to bother you.

21:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Once you have that in the profile, you can then track nudges, reminders, tell me about water, tell me about coffee, all those different scenarios.

21:22 - Eksno 
being able to add our own items that will have to be adjacent eventually. So it's better to get that done soon instead of waste time on manually updating its database fields.

21:31 - Eksno 
Yeah, I agree.

21:36 - Eksno 
I think we'll prioritize that first, and then afterwards, take care of the high-level grid.

21:43 - Eksno 
So implement the just chatting and the check-in and the transition between those. I see that. Yeah.

21:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:53 - Eksno 
Anything else?

21:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

21:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
We are going to do the...

21:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Adding the ability...

22:01 - Eksno 
Adding the ability to...

22:02 - Eksno 
The tracking items. And updating the graph. Okay, cool. All right, cheers, man.

22:23 - Eksno 
Cheers.

22:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye-bye.

22:25 - Eksno 
I'll see you.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (23).txt"

Sun, Jul 7, 2024

0:04 - Eksno 
Wow.

0:09 - Eksno 
Yeah. Um, but yeah, I have, yeah, I have like laundry scheduled at three, but yeah, it should be done with the meeting by then. Just going to watch the interview video as well at the laundry and go over that.

0:32 - Eksno 
Yeah, I'll see you there. And send a link to Conan here.

0:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Silence.

0:36 - Eksno 
Silence.

1:56 - Eksno 
I can't hear.

2:24 - Eksno 
bad lighting, I'm working from the apartment currently.

2:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
No worries, yeah, well, mine's not exactly better.

2:32 - Eksno 
You've got like a studio set up almost, a guitar in the background, plants and everything.

2:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, we're gonna hopefully launch a podcast next week, so I need to...

2:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it's all right, it's not perfect, but I don't know, I've got to test the video, the audio, and start doing all the intro, the music, all that shite. It's just, it's interesting. A lot of the stuff you see on AI, oh, it's all going to do everything for you and stuff like that. Well, one, we still can't get printers working properly at home without any problems. I think certain jobs are going to go away. And I think there's just unbelievable opportunity right now.

3:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
The big consultancies are really, they're making billions of pounds on the back of AI. It's boring shit. It's just selling and fucking copilot and stupid shit. But there's yeah, there's just still there's still mega mega money to be made from it all. Yes, I figure out how to get part of it.

3:37 - Eksno 
Hey guys. How's it going?

3:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm in Hong Kong now, back home. Here's Marco.

3:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I just came to do that, so I'm gonna turn my camera off.

3:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

3:58 - Eksno 
Yeah, so I've read through your documents and yeah, there were a few things I noticed. First off, sorry, do you want to lead with anything before I say my questions?

4:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
I suppose the thinking, just to give you some thought about why I did what I did and where it came from, I was trying to figure out what the UX starts to look like,

4:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm happy to show you something but I don't I'm sort of in my head this is a this is a thought experiment as opposed to the solution so in one way I'm like yeah it's a really good idea and another way I almost don't want to show you so that you guys might come up with something and think about totally different but if you think it's fine then I'm happy to show you what I was thinking just so you get an idea of what what I think how Flow and Mural translates into an app. Do you want me to show it to you for a sec?

5:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

5:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

5:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Go ahead. Can you see that?

5:26 - Eksno 
Yeah.

5:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So the idea here is, obviously I know that wouldn't be there because that would be the cut out of the iPhone stuff like that. So that can't really go there, but you get the idea. So this is sort of like a streak. This is where you are. This would be a persistent banner for the day, which would be a theme for the day or whatever that is. And then you wake up in the morning you would have a message, you'd have some content and video, you've also got input boxes or you've got decisions like, you know, yes, no. I think there are certain things that make sense. It's more easy to do it with a click as opposed to typing. And there's other bits that are better at typing. And I'm not entirely sure where that bit is yet. That's just sort of what it would look like with the, With the keyboard enabled, it pushes it out underneath the banner. And then the idea is maybe if you click on this A, you would have a Eat, Move, Sleep, Mind pop-up, which would give you the chart. But actually, maybe thinking about rather than having a pop-up is moving those four icons in this space up here. So they're persistent. So just sort of playing around with that. And hopefully, that sort of gives you a bit of an idea of where I think this works. I'm struggling to figure out a way or why we would have an LMS page, like an actual sort of the original UX, where you have like a Eat page and a Move page and a sort of traditional content-based page that I'm doing now. I think everything should probably be through this. And I think we probably have two personas of bots. One is the person who's giving you content and leading you through the program, as opposed to somebody who's actually coaching you.

7:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

7:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
But they may be the same thing. I don't know. That's just a question I have. I don't know whether that actually makes things more complex.

7:28 - Eksno 
I think that's more of a design decision than an integration decision, because we're using a lot of different spots and background anyway. So we could just assign a different profile photo to some of them and do A-B testing, what people like better there.

7:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, OK, cool. So shall I bring up Merle, and we can go through it? Or how do you want to? What's the best way to do it?

7:55 - Eksno 
The graph you made?

7:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:58 - Eksno 
Yeah, go ahead.

8:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where the hell is the button?

8:12 - Eksno 
Yeah, in the meantime, one question we had about the LMS. If we're moving the LMS entirely to chat, how do you want to do, like, watching videos that have been sent in the past? So the bot sends a message or sends a video, and you said there was, like, a one-week expiration. So if they take a couple of days to get to watching it, do you want them to just have to scroll up and chat, or how should they be able to retrieve it?

8:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you look at my screen here, my thinking is that you have a chat for a day, and then this banner signifies the start to a new day. Now, whether that means I can scroll down and I can scroll to past days, or whether I have to navigate, I go back to another day. So that back will go to day nine. Day 8 day 7 day 6 so I could scroll through so I can see all my previous chats and and If the video is gone, it would just be you know, a placeholder image saying sorry This is this contents no longer available or something like that Okay Yeah, so yeah, if they want to watch a video from the past they just scroll and find it I think so Yeah, but I think some of that UX I think until we start playing with it. It's hard to know what the best way is Yeah.

9:39 - Eksno 
And that's not core to the infrastructure anyway, so we can add on later.

9:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

9:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
So do you want me to talk you through this, or do you just want to jump in and ask questions?

9:51 - Eksno 
Yeah, you can give an overview of what you were thinking. Then I'll get to the questions afterwards.

9:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll make sure we're going to probably color these into. So these are notifications.

10:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nope.

10:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I'm going to sneeze.

10:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why is it not working? I fucking hate not sneezing when you want to sneeze. That's one of my very annoying things. Cool. So the idea here is the pink ones, the lighter pink ones, would be something that we instigate. So we instigate a notification to the user to start the day. There'd be some banner, which you saw at the top there, sort of a welcome message. This is a mind area. So it's a logo with some, you know, here's a, here's a quick message for the day. Um, and then you've got like, um, you know, there's potentially this.

10:45 - Eksno 
Do you mean like an app notification and that notification, or do you mean like outside? So they get on their phone notification Aristotle, we are what we repeatedly, or just to like top notification.

10:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the notification to the user is a native notification that drives them into the app. Okay. So the Aristotle we are repeatedly doing, that's in the app. So that's this bit here.

11:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
There'll be a notification that drives them into the app to start the day. So again, whether that's This message here, welcome to day 10, might be the text for that notification, maybe. And then it would probably start, you probably have a break point where you just see the video, and until they've actually watched the video, you wouldn't go to the next thing, which is how is your sleep, because they haven't engaged with the application. There might be some point of time where it, I don't know what it is, but then this would be another notification to remind them to watch the content.

11:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Yeah, I see.

11:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so that's what they're dotted lines. So they're, they're optionals. I don't, I don't know when the scheduling of that would be. And then there's logistics. So how would your sleep look last night? So that would be here. So how is your sleep? And you could just click into that sleep time and wait time box and enter in the numbers, or they can be pre-populated with the previous ones because a lot of people should hopefully do the same. So Again, that might just be a quick scroll with your finger to change the time. We'll figure that out. And then if they do answer that, there would be these two follow-on questions, like, did you wake at all during the night? If it's no, then it's finishing. If it's yes, then you'd say how many times. But that's sort of a spur of the questions there. Then there's some more content during the day.

12:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Again, same pattern. If I haven't watched it, I had to do it. And then have you done your walk, drop in your updates?

12:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then when you've done your calories, so just trying to figure out what that is, then you'd have nudge notifications throughout the day. So it's 1 o'clock. If we know that you drink coffee, don't have any more coffee, basically. One second, JP's around, he might actually join. Just give me two seconds, I'm just gonna give him this URL, where is it there?

13:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then there's reminders, drinking water, doing air squats, stuff like that. I am just, in terms of, for both of you, I'm a bit concerned with the amount of notifications we might be giving the user. And I think we could easily piss them off and they just turn the fucking thing off. But that's something I think we're going to have to figure out over time. And then there's an end-of-day check-in. And I think there's three categories. Everything's already been filled in by the user. Some of it's already been filled in, or none of it's been filled in. Actually, I'm going to call that filled in.

14:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Come on JP. I know I like you. Queen, best band in the world. Best band ever. Actually, here's going to be a really generational question.

14:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Jonas or Jorge, have either of you watched Highlander, the original movie?

14:24 - Eksno 
Yes. Absolutely.

14:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Excellent. Okay. We can continue to do business together.

14:30 - Eksno 
Still friends.

14:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know about Jorge though, but I have definitely Yeah, it's one of my favorite movies of all time and it's how music used to be written for movies where you have a single band doing the entire soundtrack and it's actually a fucking awesome album as well.

14:53 - Eksno 
Yeah, pretty insane that Cuan did that.

14:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean it was such a badly made movie that it ended up being good. The fact that you have an ancient Spanish person with a Scottish accent that nobody sort of saw the challenge with it is bizarre. Only the 80s.

15:15 - Eksno 
Probably to watch with the boys just sitting down and having a drink and laughing at.

15:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Henry Cavill is doing a remake. I think they're starting to shoot next year. So that's going to be... You either fuck it up or... All of them are pointless.

15:35 - Eksno 
One of those that are so terrible it's good movies.

15:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but like the Kurgan, he was so brilliantly casted. Yeah. Yeah, I'll get off my Highlander horse.

15:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Actually, one of the really interesting facts, which is just stupid, I know this. The scene where Sean Connery is teaching the Highlander about the quickening and he's with the stags and they're trying to get that scene. At that time of year, all of the stags had lost their antlers because they were, I think that's rutting or whatever that phase of the year is. So they actually had to get a stag and they stuck on antlers with glue to its head. And the deer, basically as soon as they did it, it ran away and freaked out. So they literally, it was a complete accident that whole scene. They didn't get to do it properly.

16:39 - Jonathan Phillips 
I also find it amazing that stags lose their antlers every year. That's just bizarre.

16:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but they're not like they're small. Crazy. Cool, so maybe just so you know, sort of what I've been doing here is trying to take them through the day in the life of all the comms and sort of going backwards and forwards, because the guys are working on the graph, which is sort of the high level data architecture of how all the different components, the relationship of the bots and who does what and how it all works. And I think we had started originally with this sort of very clear idea of the end of day check-in. But I think that's evolving from my thinking, and this sort of flow, I think, will sort of bring that to life. So you've got the sort of content that's pushed to the user throughout the day. They may engage or not engage with that. And then you end up having three categories. They've either filled everything in and watched everything, they've done some of it, or they've done all of it, or they've done none of it. So for example, if they've done none of it, That doesn't make any sense. Let's say he didn't sleep. You're on a nine-day streak. Let's not break that. Drop in your walking updates. And so basically, this is about just capturing the remaining things to be done, which is sort of what we're working at the moment. This is just an example of two things, and this is an example of everything. That text needs to change.

18:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
So be like this. Let's not break it. Drop in your updates below. So if we're going to move to a form-based, one of the questions I had is, at the moment, the bot or the agent that you're designing is incredibly chat-based. But actually, I'm wondering, For these sorts of things, it doesn't really make sense to me that it's a chat. I think more having an input makes a lot more sense, because it's a lot less effort for the user to do that. And getting that UX right, I think, is really important. But then, whether you're, everything's already filled in, some of it's filled in, none of it's already filled in, once you have this, then there's sort of the coaching phase. And then on a coaching phase, I think there's sort of three flavors of user. There's a user who's on top of it, seems to be smashing everything. They're irregular, they're sometimes doing it, sometimes not doing it, and then they're disengaged. So there's three sort of flavors of users. So if they're on a streak, it's basically saying, yeah, you know, you're on top of it. It's rewarding, it's acknowledging them, it's championing them, saying that they're doing really good. And then sort of giving them some milestones. You've nearly walked a marathon, you've also not eaten about 20 bags of sweets, blah, blah, blah. And then some sense of this is what's going on tomorrow. And if you, so this is awareness of where we are in the program. So it's saying, you smashed it today, this is what's going on tomorrow, and then if you wanted to do, here's some meditation. If they're irregular, I think we need to start figuring out what are the patterns of irregularity. So for example, I noticed that you often struggle with your habits on Tuesdays. I get it like it's in the way. You matter, your health matters. What do you feel are the reasons you're struggling on Tuesdays? Or you're not doing your walks. We know that right now, what's one thing you can do right now to get your walk in tomorrow? What's food that you can prepare today that you can eat tomorrow or eat better? And then I was thinking, well, actually, that's really fucking pointless saying that at eight o'clock at night. Because they're very likely to then do that. But the walk makes sense to talk about that late at night, right? So this coaching, at the moment, this is feeling very sequential and non-organic. And actually, I would imagine, for example, if someone's a regular and we notice that they have issues with their eating, I might want to bring that up during the day rather than just having this sort of very linear process where your data, do coaching, stop. I don't think that's sort of, depending on the context of the issue, I don't think that's useful. And then this is sort of a question was like, do we need to have a bot that's reviewing users behavior? A bit like where you have a collector, like is there a behavior analyzer, which is basically looking at all the profile data and the patterns of the user, which is then extracting insights and saying, Overall, people struggle on Fridays, but this person struggles on a Tuesday or whatever it is.

21:14 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think that's one of the key things in the whole operation.

21:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
So several reasons. One, it alerts you to how the whole process is working. But also, it means you can improve things dramatically. And if the whole interface is about habit forming and nudging, et cetera, then that's the key thing that will enable you to enhance that as time goes on.

21:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Makes sense.

21:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then this is just somebody who's just not on board with the program. And it's like, you're not recording your habits. Can we chat?

21:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're overeating your calories. That's going to slow your progress. And you're not recording. So this is just, again, an example of the issues. And eventually, both of those patterns flowed back into some level of acknowledgment of where you are and then what's coming up tomorrow. So I think this sort of pattern across a day where we're pushing content to, well, first of all, it starts with notifications pushing you into the app. Then there's the chat. So this is what it might look like as a sort of an interface.

22:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
They may or may not engage with the content. They may or may not supply the data. So then there's definitely a data cleanup phase. And then there's a, Probably an end of day coaching, but for certain things, there might be a midday or during an intraday coaching.

22:48 - Eksno 
Yeah. Is there going to be any other coaching scenarios than midday and end of day?

22:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when I say midday, let's call it intraday. There's some point during the day it makes more sense. Like it could be the first thing in the morning and say, hey, listen, we're noticing that you're struggling with your eating. So what's something that you can do today to change that? There's certain things that will be more appropriate in the morning as opposed to the evening. And I think that, I mean, it's hard. It's really hard. Like it was only until I started playing with it this week that I started really thinking about This chatting to update my habits feels labored. It feels much easier if I was just to put it in as sleep time, wake time. That would just feel a lot less onerous for a user. Now, one of the challenges I also have with this, the anti-pattern to this is, as soon as you put those buttons and those boxes in there, it no longer feels like a person talking to me.

23:51 - Jonathan Phillips 
yeah it very much becomes a system now that might just be the tone it might be the style I think if you have a follow-up as soon as they put the data in to not necessarily engage in a conversation but to report back to them it feels like someone's saying hey thank you for doing that and then on to the next thing yeah I I think that's a really good point actually rather than you know If I was

24:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
saying good morning to JP, I'll say something, but I'm going to wait for you to come back to me in real life before I start spamming you. So I don't think we'd ever want the user coming in. Well, actually, no, I do spam you.

24:28 - Jonathan Phillips 
You don't do that, no.

24:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
I spam you with fucking shit every morning. But yeah, I think somebody coming in to five or six messages from the bot, I think, shows a disconnected from them. So I think it's got to be very much An actual conversation as opposed to a chat interface where we're just pushing shit out to people From like a technical perspective over time we can allow both but we should choose

25:03 - Eksno 
one to focus on for the moment either buttons or through the chats. We were originally doing through the chat because that's the more like unproven way to do it and also felt the most natural as if having a conversation than we were planning to add buttons later when there was more focus on the UX.

25:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
I get that, but I think this is an incredibly user experience driven solution. And if we just focus on the technical aspects, I think we could end up missing and not understanding something really fundamental.

25:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for me, and again, this is just my point of view. I'm not saying it's right. So everybody please do chime in. I actually think having an app to test this very soon outside of the web interface is going to change how we get feedback and use it. I actually think the experience of this in my hand on my phone as opposed to on a web page typing in is fundamentally different. Me typing on my keyboard versus on my phone is a very, very different experience in using it. And I think if we're pushing people into predominantly mobile, which I think most consumers will be using, I'm concerned that we could look at optimizing a solution for something that's not where we end up being. Now, I know at some point, very early doors, that doesn't really matter because you're doing so much of the sort of core foundation. But my concern is that we've had to do a significant rewrite from the architecture moving from Python to typecast and that's fine. I just don't want us to, and there's always a degree of rework. I get that. I'm just trying to say, if we know where we're going to go to a point, is there stuff that we can do today to start bringing this to life? Because actually, if you look at this, pushing content, even if it's the same piece of content every day, in the context and figuring out what the dance between content and notifications is a really big, important part of the UX. Data capture, we're doing that. And I think we've proven already that we can look at someone's profile, see what they have or haven't done, and ask relevant questions around it. But actually, if we think actually putting in the buttons is the right thing to do, spending loads of time crafting data capture through text doesn't make any sense to me. Where actually coaching and noticing patterns over time, this orange thing here, as JP said, potentially comes actually the most important thing because this allows us to get better at what we're doing. And this is that, if everything here is around habit formation, we need to understand what's getting in the way of people.

28:12 - Eksno 
Yeah. So yeah, the primary thing is we should move forward with one of the UX aspects for now, just so we don't spend time doing both, either the buttons or the inputting through chat. Earlier, we decided on chat, but we can do buttons instead. But there will be some overhead of implementing that. But if it's worth it, it's worth it, of course. In relation to the getting it on your phone, we should be able to pretty quickly make it a PWA, like half a day. And it should be a PWA, at which point you can install it on your own phone. But if you want it to be a native app.

28:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for the end solution, this is a native app. It's not a PWA, yeah?

28:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

29:01 - Eksno 
The PWA would be to get it on the tester's phone, so that you can install it on the phone and get the experience, even though you won't be getting it through the app store.

29:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, makes sense. I mean, I think Given my experience of playing with it for the last few days, the...

29:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
The different feedback I have from where I thought it was to what it actually is has been quite significant in a positive way. It's different when I start playing with it in my actual hands.

29:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's why I did this sort of end-to-day workflow, because actually, this data capture thing where we seem to be spending a lot of time on, if we actually think the better case is buttons. I don't know whether we actually have a scenario where we're doing it by text or by button. I mean, I suppose we could.

30:21 - Eksno 
One point is the capture through text is already implemented, so that is the fastest way to move forward. Implementing buttons, especially in chat buttons that the bot creates instead of buttons that are always on the screen, like those four buttons at the top for inputting, will take quite some time. Getting the bot to be able to create buttons and display those on the screen is not an easy task.

30:53 - Eksno 
It's, of course, possible, but I'm not sure if that's where we should be investing time right now. Instead, maybe go with the original approach of having the four persistent buttons at the top or bottom, like you showed in the other application, where they can always input the values.

31:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, that was more for showing reports over time, not for data input.

31:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, obviously there's all sorts of scenarios that we haven't done. It's like, what happens if it's, you just, you had a busy day yesterday. Can you go back and enter yesterday's data? You know, there's a couple of nuances, but I think for me, what's really important is understanding to test it. We need to be able to input data completely or partially or not. How do we deal with that? Again, if we're dealing with this through text for now, maybe that's okay. I think getting into the coaching, so having the idea that someone's on a streak, someone's a regular or someone's disengaged is more important so that we can start figuring out what the coaching aspect is and when to intervene because I think that's the bit where we're now starting to form habits as opposed to filling in fields.

32:12 - Jonathan Phillips 
That's the difference between this proposed app and everything that's out there at the moment. Everything out there at the moment is very much driven by a process that is fixed, whereas the whole coaching element and the analysis of where the user is is something that's new. So I think that's got to be a core focus.

32:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

32:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So given that, I mean, if you're saying that getting to buttons is extra effort, but actually from a technical point of view, whether you capture the data through buttons or text doesn't really matter and allows us to get into testing the coaching aspect, then maybe that's the right thing to do.

32:59 - Eksno 
Yeah, I think the best approach is to continue with the implemented solution where it's collected through chats. Maybe then also afterwards, once we've got like a full day experience with you having it on your phone, you might notice it's like a bit different once you're not just doing a check-in for a web interface. If it's like going through an entire day, it may be different entering through the chat, a different experience.

33:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
How far away are we from actually being able to do this on a daily basis so that we can actually start building up profiles of ourselves over time? Rather than just looking at a point in time data capture.

33:38 - Eksno 
It's hard to say on the spots.

33:50 - Eksno 
During or by the end of next week, I want to have the full day check-in basically implemented. So yeah, and the transitions between the top level or the just chatting and doing a check-in. So that's when you wake up, you can go, hey, I slept eight hours today. Or, hey, my wake up time was this, and I slept at this time. And then it goes to the collector more dynamically than it is currently, where it's like a very sad process. We also have to change it from being collect, coach, collect, coach, to collect everything, then coach at the end of the day.

34:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

34:34 - Eksno 
Oh, yeah.

34:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
What else we can't forget is that we are here to do a cool tech implementation so technology is really important and the AI is obviously leading edge and important but it's all about user experience so that's one thing that we can't forget with everything that we do it's irrelevant unless it's all about user experience so that's something we've got to we all forget when we do these and we've got to keep every iteration that we do we've got to think back how will that work in real life will the user benefit from that? Will they like it? Will they hate it? How is it compared with competitors? And every time we've got to have that iteration, I think, and just think back.

35:16 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so when do you think the next So you think by the end of the week we'll have something else to start playing with?

35:38 - Eksno 
Yeah, hopefully more of a full day application converted to PWA and the input fields should be more dynamic to where you can input them through the admin panel or create the check-in items there. I'm wondering how that will sync up with what time of day they'll be collected if you make like a prompt to the AI describing when the item should be collected or if it's like a select time of day or how it will work. So we'll have to look into that.

36:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

36:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, because I think We can't really do the coaching until you can have a profile over time, because there's no patterns really to do. The coaching will be very limited. So profile over time is a precursor to testing the coaching.

36:47 - Jorge Lewis 
We can make dummy profiles in Superbase, like within the database. We can make like 10 examples where each one is a different example case.

36:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

36:59 - Jorge Lewis 
And then one more thing I want to, I'm brushing my teeth, so I don't know if you guys can hear me all right, but the another question I have is, are we definitely for sure switching from collecting, coaching, collecting, coaching to just collecting first and then end of day or intraday coaching?

37:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I don't understand the difference there.

37:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Beforehand we were doing some we were collecting and then the coach was going to provide coaching on that on that tracking item but as I've been told the The new way is going to be collect first and then whether it's at the end of the day or some time in the middle of the day Disregarding that specific tracking item.

37:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
We're just going to coach on all the items No, no, no, no I'm glad you asked the question because we're there's a gap there so There's data capture, which happens independently and asynchronously throughout the day. And a person will have either had everything filled in, some of it filled in, or none of it filled in. So there are definitely an end of day hoovering up exercise to collect data.

38:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
That could be followed on by some coaching. Like on a streak, hey, well done, bit of champing. There's no coaching there. There's just champion. Well, you could call that coaching if you want to, but it is not, you're not going in and discovering the issue and helping them, you know, habit formation. Um, there's a regular and disengaged, you know, if someone's massively disengaged, suddenly doing a deep conversation with them at the end of the night, doesn't make sense to me, but you might say, Hey, listen, it feels like, We're going to need a good hour to have a conversation here. Would you like to arrange a coaching session for 30 minutes and let's schedule that in? That might be the disengage thing here. And that might be something that happens the next day or three days later to go in. And maybe that's an escalation to one of the human coaches. So the way you were saying it, I was feeling that it was like, right, it's going to be here or here. And that feels unnatural. I think we have to be a bit more organic with what we're trying to approach here, as if we were actually a person. Like, I wouldn't call somebody up unscheduled at 6 p.m. And say, right, let's do an hour's coaching right now. It's just not gonna happen. But there's micro-coaching, where you're just asking them a single question and being curious. But then I think there could be a full-on coaching session needed for disengaged. And as I said here, telling somebody at eight o'clock at night, you need to sort out your food in the morning, it's too late. So there's context. If we notice certain issues, certain issues are better described first thing in the morning. Say, hey, listen, we noticed over the last, if you go back to here and you're saying, hey, welcome to day 10, actually, you might actually stick in a custom message there for me to say, hey, listen, today's Tuesday. We know on Wednesdays, you really struggle with your food. Have a think today about stuff that you can do better today that sets you up for success tomorrow. So that's a little bit of coaching.

40:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it's more appropriate rather than doing it at the end of the day. I feel I'm failing to get the right words. But it feels like we're hard coding or we're looking for coaching will be at 12 o'clock and at That feels very old-school, traditional way of approaching the solution, rather than going, actually, what's the dynamic element of here? What's the emergent nature of this on a per-user basis?

40:55 - Eksno 
OK. I just want to say I've got to go in around 15 minutes. I have a lot of work scheduled.

41:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
No worries.

41:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I think these conversations, by the way, are really important. They're fundamental to where we're going to go with this. And again, there's no expectation that we're fully aligned, nor should we be. But I think through these conversations, you become more and more aligned. So I welcome the challenges and the thoughts. I think we need to be doing this, certainly at the start of every, OK, this is the next thing, the next big thing we're going to work on. We need to have these alignments to make sure really deeply aligned, both in terms of the immediate next scope, but also how that fits into the bigger picture. Because as I'm using it more and more, even my knowledge and my experience is changing. We had originally spec'd out pages and pages for the content to be displayed. I'm not so sure that's needed anymore.

41:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
So in one way, scope's reducing, and in other ways, it's becoming more nuanced.

42:02 - Eksno 
Yeah. Do you guys have like a Cal.com or Calendly link that you could send us where we can just schedule meetings on the fly?

42:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think Google Calendar has entered in a new feature around that. I haven't actually started to use it yet, but generally, if you contact us on Discord, I mean, pretty much from about 6 a.m. Local time till about midnight, I'm online most days.

42:32 - Eksno 
6am till midnight.

42:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe not midnight, maybe till about 11, 12, 10 or 11.

42:38 - Eksno 
How long do you wake up till you go to sleep?

42:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Pretty much, I'm never really online, certainly with this stuff. There's just so much stuff to do, so obviously we're doing a whole load of stuff in the background all the time.

42:54 - Jorge Lewis 
You're doing one of my favourite magic tricks, you just get a full work out of thin air.

43:00 - Eksno 
Yeah, pretty much.

43:01 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think what Chris says, we're flexible, so we do other stuff as well during the day, but any time we can switch and jump on calls.

43:12 - Eksno 
Yeah. I'd definitely like tomorrow to schedule a call where you guys can get introduced to our link chain developer, Chen Mei. He's been really helpful. Oh yeah, nice.

43:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Tomorrow is going to be a challenge, myself and Ira, for traveling up to Leeds for a meeting. And we're traveling in a meeting all day, so that is a bit of an anomaly. But I'd rather have dedicated time where I can sit down and really go into that. So Tuesday is definitely better. OK. Yeah.

43:44 - Eksno 
Yeah, let's schedule a call on Tuesday, then.

43:52 - Eksno 
Will you be available, Jorge?

43:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'll put in my calendar what time I'm free, because I'll be free, like, one hour or two hours before the flight.

44:01 - Eksno 
So yeah.

44:03 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

44:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. As long as I have Wi-Fi, I can borrow from other my neighbors.

44:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So just so you guys know as well, so I had that dinner the other night where I was with Dell and NVIDIA. I didn't actually realize that Dell is NVIDIA's biggest. Does your wife know? Sorry, Jorge?

44:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm sorry, Del just sounded like a girl's name and I was like...

44:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I don't know who's Del. No, Del, the head of UK was sitting beside me. There was a whole lot of lords who are very sort of senior politicians on the table. And I'm spending all day Wednesday with Del.

44:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
They run a AI factory, what they call it.

44:51 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think to give context, guys, Dell used to be one of the biggest PC manufacturers in the world. Oh, Dell.

44:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
D-E-L-L. Yeah, I thought it was a name.

45:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
Adele. Adele.

45:05 - Eksno 
Yeah, I had a Dell computer back in the day.

45:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's all I ever thought they would. The majority of Nvidia chips is on Dell kit around the world. So given how powerful Nvidia is, you can imagine what's happened to the growth of Dell.

45:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
They've gone huge. The consultancy that myself and Arif are trying to set up around AI pretty much is exactly what they're doing. The only difference is they're doing it for colossally large companies and they're able to throw a shit ton of free consulting at it to get the multi-million pound sort of kit sell. That's what they're, they're doing all of this to sell kits. So it's gonna be interesting. I'm gonna go in and get, I'm going in as a client on Wednesday to see if there's anything that I can learn in terms of what we might be able to do together. But I think, I think actually we have, more opportunity at the SMB level and small medium businesses than I think they do because they don't really like our previous consultancy. They don't engage companies under 500 million revenue because they just won't tolerate their rates. There's an awful lot of money under that, like huge amounts of money. And there just isn't a lot of people who know what the fuck they're talking about in AI. There's a lot of noise. Our problem now is one of noise to signal.

46:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
But yeah, we'll see what we can do with that. But yeah, Tuesday would be good. I'm free from lots of stuff in the morning. But afternoon is wide open. I can do 12 to 2.30.

46:58 - Eksno 
OK. I think we can probably schedule that in chat once Jorge has his flight time.

47:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll be over the Pacific at that time.

47:08 - Eksno 
No worries.

47:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Or was that Tuesday or Monday?

47:10 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I don't have to be there as well. If it's recorded, I can watch it later.

47:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

47:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Just another note is that this is my brother's weekend, my brother's wedding this Saturday. So busy, busy week for me. So you won't be seeing much of me. I'll be available for most meetings throughout the day. But yeah.

47:31 - Jorge Lewis 
No worries. What part of the world is he getting married in?

47:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Kansas. The US.

47:38 - Eksno 
Nice.

47:40 - Eksno 
desert.

47:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Deserted.

47:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Deserted. Okay.

47:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
As Dorothy said, we're not in Kansas anymore. Yep. Cool.

47:58 - Eksno 
One more thing before we leave. I don't know if Jorge has already notified, but we're spending a fair amount of effort on hiring currently so that we can scale up our development efforts and get faster, basically. So there may be some slowdowns because of that. But hopefully those slowdowns are for massive speedups.

48:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, totally expected. Just obviously keep us informed. And I think that's the biggest thing to say, hey, listen, We're interviewing five people this week, so we're going to be a bit slower. That's fine. It just helps us. Because obviously, one of the big issues is, now that we've got a stable release, it's great, but demand from our side then becomes even more enticing. Because we're like, right, let's get moving. We want to push and push and push. So there is this tension between pushing and scaling. That's just an inevitable issue that we have.

48:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, great.

48:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. All right. Cheers, guys.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (24).txt"

0:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
We're up.

2:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, how are you?

2:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Good morning, I'm doing good, how are you?

2:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hey, can you hear me?

3:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep, loud and clear, how about me?

3:03 - Eksno 
Yeah, I can hear you, loud and clear too. You're in Makati, right?

3:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep, I'm in Makati right now. Yeah, nice.

3:14 - Eksno 
I know a little bit of Tagalog, just a bit, I'm counting.

3:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That'S nice.

3:28 - Eksno 
Do you have access to the repository? Do you have access to the repository? Not yet. Not yet? Let me get you out. Could you send me your username?

3:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Your GitHub username?

3:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This is my GitHub username and the message threads in the call.

4:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If you want, here's my email address.

4:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

4:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Thank you.

4:20 - Eksno 
Okay, I have invited you. It's a pending response.

4:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I'll accept it right now. $15, right? Yeah, $15. Just to... Okay.

4:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How long have you been working in Solana?

4:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I guess around one and a half year already. About one to one and a half years.

4:53 - Eksno 
That's like basically around when it's released, right? Oh, yeah.

5:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I was I was playing with it when it launched, yeah. At least a few months after it launched. Because I remember I was a Vue fan back then before I fully converted myself to Svelte.

5:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Which style?

5:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Vue.

5:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Vue and Nuxt.

5:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Nice. Yeah.

5:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Uh, yeah.

5:33 - Eksno 
Yeah, I can probably introduce myself. I'm Jonas Lindberg, I have been working with George Lewis as co-founder and acting CTO of the company currently. So yeah, I've been coding since I was in 9th grade, got like a trade school for software engineering and I went on to work with a bunch of European oil and gas industry applications after that, including some banking applications and such. Then afterwards, I've been collaborating together with George Lewis since like 2016, I think.

6:17 - Eksno 
And we've just been having weird projects after projects. We started with a weird hobby, ant collecting or ant keeping, where we wanted to try to produce nests on those. That didn't work out too well. Then we tried game design. Eventually, we found out, OK, let's make some money and started a consultancy. And yeah, now we've got some clients on our working way.

6:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That's nice. I guess for me, I don't have that much of a portfolio compared to yours. I just started when, I guess in 2019. I did some HTML back in high school, but those were like the MySpace days. Remember those? Forgot. 2019,

7:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, no, no, I mean, I started early during the MySpace years, forgot about it, and then...

7:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

7:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, I don't really code that much, but I've been a web developer for about three years now. Now my current stack is, well, I used to do Vue and Django.

7:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, cool.

7:44 - Eksno 
I heard you were leading a local software community, right?

7:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Not necessarily leading, I don't want to sound too... I don't want to sound like I'm really a professional, but I'm helping a community grow.

8:02 - Eksno 
Okay. Yeah, nice. How did you find...

8:10 - Eksno 
SvelteKit developers in Lakati, how do you find people in the local community?

8:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually there's a Facebook group already, Svelte Developers. So there's people interested in Svelte. The tech itself gathers people so it's not that hard. The difficult thing though is setting up a meeting point because Did you say Norway?

8:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, Norway. Norway, Europe.

8:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I'm from Norway.

9:05 - Eksno 
Nice!

9:08 - Eksno 
Interesting that Norwegian in there.

9:12 - Eksno 
Do you know where in Norway?

9:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I actually don't know. He is a little bit private in life, but he's the most active member. He always greets everyone on Happy Birthday and all that stuff.

9:28 - Eksno 
Oh, okay.

9:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Wow.

9:33 - Eksno 
Yeah, to let you in, we are no SvelteKit experts, so you are most definitely better at SvelteKits than us.

9:43 - Eksno 
Currently, we don't have any web-specific tasks. So what I was thinking for today is I basically can introduce you to the project and let you go through the pages, see how it is, and probably improve it in a lot of ways where you can take self-initiative to do the tasks that you find for yourself, if that makes sense. Until we have more like specific things that you can work on and at that point when you have specific things that we need you to or that we have specific things we need you to work on, then you'll be familiar with the project.

10:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay. So if I get it right, if I'm going to pick my tasks in a Trello board, right? Like, if there's a task out there, I'm going to try to pick it and do it myself. And take the initiative.

10:43 - Eksno 
Yes, but we don't really have many web tasks for the moment. So I was thinking for today, I'll onboard you onto the project.

10:53 - Eksno 
Make sure you can get the repository cloned and installed and running. And then afterwards, you can...

11:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

11:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, I mean, OK, please continue.

11:07 - Eksno 
Yeah. And then afterwards, you can use your own initiative to see where you can see that there can be improvements and basically improve our front end on your own initiative until we have more specific front end tasks we need you to do. And then when we have those more specific tasks that we need you to do on the Trello board, then you're already familiar with the project OK, got it.

11:34 - Eksno 
So where do we start?

11:37 - Eksno 
Probably cloning the repo, if you haven't already.

11:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Great. Let me try sharing my screen so you can see what I'm seeing.

11:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, perfect.

11:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Screen at Please work. Sometimes in Google Meet, this doesn't work. Does it work? Can you see my screen?

11:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Not yet.

12:02 - Eksno 
Doesn't look like it. What operating system are you using?

12:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm using Linux. This is... Yeah, same as me. It's a Wayland issue.

12:11 - Eksno 
Wayland? Okay. Do you have the XDB portal things installed?

12:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I have it. I'm using pipeware to do screen sharing.

12:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
For me, to get the screen sharing to work, I have...

12:31 - Eksno 
Let's see, I'll try screen sharing in Discord, just a moment.

13:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah no, it doesn't work there too. Anyways, I think I can do this without screen sharing. It's not gonna be too technical, right?

13:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry, you're on mute.

13:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

13:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What distro are you using?

13:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's okay.

13:39 - Eksno 
What, sorry?

13:41 - Eksno 
What distro are you using? What Linux distro?

13:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm using... I use Arch, by the way.

13:48 - Eksno 
Nice. I use NixOS, so, uh, can't, uh, hard to transfer.

13:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, you're using the good OS. I'm planning to transfer soon, but I'm scared. OK. I can't wait. I got API shell and web.

14:07 - Eksno 
I'll be back soon.

14:11 - Eksno 
So the API directory is like an old directory from our Python days. We've now migrated most of that code to TypeScript. And it's inside the library server AI directory.

14:27 - Eksno 
As for the shell project, that's a SvelteKit Tori application, which has an iframe of the website in it, just so we can install the application natively on device. So you can basically ignore that application too.

14:44 - Eksno 
The only directory you'll need to care about is the web directory. So yeah, you can cd into web.

14:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then pnpmi.

14:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Are you using pnpm here?

14:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

15:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, pnpm. I'll just install pnpm real quick.

15:06 - Eksno 
Yeah, no problem. I'll just get environment variables sorted real quick.

15:30 - Eksno 
What are you using instead of PNPM?

15:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I use YARN.

15:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
YARN?

15:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. I heard it's not as good as it is. Before that, I don't really test. I haven't tested PMPM yet. I'm done.

16:02 - Eksno 
I haven't tested it yet, but I think it's cool.

16:05 - Eksno 
Is basically just PMPM, but a bit better.

16:09 - Eksno 
It does stashing and caching stuff properly.

16:17 - Eksno 
Let me just get to creating your API key. OK.

16:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Which one do you prefer?

16:32 - Eksno 
Will or Vincent?

16:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think Will. I'm going to create an environment file here.

16:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep, Will.

16:53 - Eksno 
I'll be just creating an environment file in one moment.

16:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There.

17:19 - Eksno 
If you want to, you'll have to make your own Langsmith API key, but I don't think you'll be using it, so you should be able to just copy and paste that in, and it should be good. Okay.

17:44 - Eksno 
just do pnpm dev, but because pnpm alias is all the commands for you, so you don't need to do the run, but yeah. After the pnpm is finished, you should be able to do pnpm dev as long as the environment variables are in the .env file.

18:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, checking localhost. Let's see. 5174. So I'm seeing select chat.

18:29 - Eksno 
Yeah. There you should be able to click on one of the profiles. You can just select mine for now.

18:45 - Eksno 
Oh, it looks like someone's actually testing you somewhere. You should be able to see free messages.

18:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

18:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Something, something, test message.

19:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, what's this chatbot doing right now? What's the expected function?

19:19 - Eksno 
Quite complicated, but very simply explained, it's supposed to be a life coach, which imitates the coaching style of our client, Kuon.

19:35 - Eksno 
how it's implemented is pretty complicated using a lot of systems.

19:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

19:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Yeah.

19:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'd like to ask more of the details. Is it okay?

19:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, of course.

20:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How do you get the data? Do you just create it from, for example, for you Jonas, in order for the AI to create the persona, how do we create the data to feed the model?

20:20 - Eksno 
It's a large language model. It's using GPT-4 at the moment.

20:28 - Eksno 
I'm guessing you don't have access to the Superbase since you don't have access to the GitHub repository, so I can add you there. Have you worked with Superbase before?

20:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, please add me there too. I've worked with Superbase before too.

20:42 - Eksno 
Yeah, perfect.

20:53 - Eksno 
You sent your email there, yeah.

21:14 - Eksno 
There, I sent you an invite.

21:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's taking a bit of time to load. Yeah, there we go.

21:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Something went wrong. Let me try again.

21:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think I should... Okay. Never mind. We're good.

22:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Can you see my screen?

22:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's taking a bit of time to load. It's color black.

22:26 - Eksno 
It's color black? Okay. Wayland moment. One moment.

22:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes. Wayland moment. Yeah.

22:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Literally.

22:40 - Eksno 
Umm...

22:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, I think it's still black.

22:46 - Eksno 
Yes.

22:48 - Eksno 
Okay.

22:49 - Eksno 
Entire screen. Screen, screen. Entire screen, share. Yes, entire screen.

23:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Please pipeline.

23:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, no, pipeline now. Okay.

23:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, amazing.

23:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is it just me, or what?

23:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I love bleeding edge technology.

23:25 - Eksno 
Yeah, let me try select region instead of entire screen.

23:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK.

23:32 - Eksno 
Region, select region. But I'll select the entire screen. There. Is the screen sharing now?

23:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
oh yeah yeah wow nice it's working it's working yeah okay uh what like uh desktop environment slash compositor do you use I use hyperland as my compositor same Nice. What about IDE? I'm betting you rise up your... Oh, I lose. I'm sounding like a douche, but I use NeoVim.

24:17 - Eksno 
Do you know what this is?

24:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. NVMP. I have that. Wait, you're using NeoVim, right?

24:30 - Eksno 
I'm using NeoVim. But with LazyGit.

24:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Or LazyVim.

24:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm a lazy Vin!

24:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah! It's just a plugin manager though, lazy Vin.

24:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay. Yeah, I've heard of it before. I wanted to try it, but...

24:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's very nice.

24:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
You know, the influencers told me to...

24:56 - Eksno 
The other one, but they hurt too much. I don't know.

25:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I was actually... Influenced by the time I tried to just use Kickstarter and since I don't know how to actually configure it, I'm stuck in there.

25:16 - Eksno 
Yeah, so do we have the same origin story or what?

25:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I guess, I guess. I just don't touch my Uh-huh.

25:36 - Eksno 
Yeah, there's a lot of delay on here.

25:43 - Eksno 
Yeah, I think there's some lag, but please go on.

25:46 - Eksno 
Yeah, I also started in NeoVim because of the Primogen copied his dot files.

25:56 - Eksno 
And then after copying his dot files, I came across LazyBim because of another YouTuber, I don't remember who, and then tried LazyVim, and it was so much easier to do the plugin management.

26:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah.

26:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm halfway there in the LazyVim. Once I gather enough courage to actually remove my NeoVim config, I'll probably move to LazyVim someday.

26:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

26:31 - Eksno 
I can show you, I have my entire .files public. Inside here I have .files neobem, and it's pretty simple how it works. There's just a plugin folder, and inside those you just load the plugins that you want. And then I have the config, which is just a copy of of the prime agenda, the prime time.

27:06 - Eksno 
Basically.

27:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Can you hear me?

27:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. I'm just laughing.

27:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm at the point in my life where I'm also putting my configs in GitHub. Yeah. It's like a small flex. Yeah, yeah.

27:30 - Eksno 
Gotta have it as your pinned repository.

27:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I will probably pin it someday.

27:46 - Eksno 
Yeah, so I can run you through the application a bit, like just give you an overview, and then we can get more into where information has gotten from and such. Sound good?

28:02 - Eksno 
Sounds good.

28:03 - Eksno 
Yeah, so the project is, the SvelteKit project has at its core like these two folders, the chat and the admin panel. The admin panel is definitely where most of the Svelte action is on. Sorry?

28:26 - Eksno 
No, it's lagging, but please just keep on going.

28:29 - Eksno 
Yeah, maybe we can try Discord instead.

28:34 - Eksno 
Maybe it lags less there. Other servers.

28:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

28:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, see you there.

4:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Am I audible? Hey, how are you?

4:48 - Eksno 
Yeah, I'm all good. How about you? Yeah, I'm good.

4:51 - Eksno 
Can you hear me fine?

4:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, nice.

4:56 - Eksno 
Let me just turn up the volume a little.

5:08 - Eksno 
Can you try to speak again?

5:10 - Eksno 
Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Is it fine now? Yeah. Yes.

5:14 - Eksno 
I just have to turn up the volume.

5:18 - Eksno 
Yeah. So, yeah. Would you like to introduce yourself?

5:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

5:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
So, hi there. My name is Hasnain sayyed. I have done my bachelor's in information technology from Mumbai, New York City. And apart from my studies, I love participating in hackathons. To solve the real world problem. And talking about my experiences, I have done two internships, where at the first I was working with AWS innovate, where under where I was working under the project called CodeMate, which is a VS code extension. Through that project, I was working in lang chain and vector database technology. And talking about second internship, I was working with Mercor, which is a US-based startup. I was building the sneaker e-commerce platform. Yeah, that's my intro.

6:11 - Eksno 
Yes, sounds good. Yes, for me, I'm Jonas Lindberg or Jonas. I've been programming since ninth grade, took trade school in software engineering. And yeah, after that, I worked for two years and one of the like European style oil industry programming companies, everything C sharp and everything. So I worked on a lot of internal software there, including like a bank applications. Yeah, just working with oil data and such. And afterwards started up this company with George Lewis. And we've gone through a lot of phases in this company, but we seem to have singled in on targeting subject matter experts that want to create AI solutions using the benefits that LangChain provides over just chucking in chat activity. Because yeah, making large language models reliable, basically.

7:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:14 - Eksno 
Great, great. Yeah.

7:17 - Eksno 
So how much has George told you about the projects that Can you repeat? How much has George told you about the project today?

7:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
About the project? He has told me like currently he will be judging me for two to four days for $40 a day. And after that, if it works fine, then I will be shifting to a full-time job.

7:44 - Eksno 
Yeah. About the project, has he told you anything about the project? No, no.

7:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
He hasn't informed me about the project. OK.

7:53 - Eksno 
So Adapt, or Adapt Journey, is a live coach bot that you interact through a chat interface. And on the side of that chat interface, there's a learning management system, so videos to watch and such. There's a to-do application. And just things that interact with the LiveCoach. The LiveCoach is basically trying to emulate our client Kuon's coaching style as close as possible. And for doing that, we use SlangChain to explain very simply. The web technology we use is SvelteKit, along with Taylor and CSS for styling, and ShadCM as a component library. And all the lang chain code, AI code, is all inside the same project in a library folder.

8:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, great, great. So does the chat application also have a rag model like a vector database? For example, the users will try to upload their own custom document. And based on that document, a user can ask a question to LAMP chain. And based on that document, they will be getting the answer. So is such scenario will be applicable in this project?

9:20 - Eksno 
We currently have a data source reg, which Kuhn uploads PDF files, EPUB files about, for example, live coaching, healthy eating habits and such. And we use that data source reg to fetch information for the agent to use when answering user queries.

9:43 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, great. So can you tell me which vector database are you using, like Pinecone, Milibus, or?

9:50 - Eksno 
I'm using Superbasis vector database, which is a PG vector, I think. Yeah, great, great, great.

10:01 - Eksno 
Yeah.

10:03 - Eksno 
Let me get a PDF up that's kind of a diagram of the application real quick. Then I can screen share and show you a bit. Yeah, sure.

10:17 - Eksno 
Oh, actually, it's yeah.

10:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
And also the code for language should be written in JavaScript.

10:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's in TypeScript.

10:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
TypeScript. Okay, fine.

10:57 - Eksno 
Let's see if screen sharing is happy with me today. Sometimes it just doesn't want to work properly.

11:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. The screen is loading.

11:13 - Eksno 
It seems to be sharing black. Let me try again.

11:35 - Eksno 
Thank you.

11:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you see it now?

11:46 - Eksno 
Yeah, yeah. Now I can see it. Perfect.

11:55 - Eksno 
Can you see this PDF, the diagram here?

12:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
Hello? Yeah, yeah.

12:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
I can see the PDF.

12:10 - Eksno 
Where did I find it?

12:15 - Eksno 
So this is basically showing a diagram of one day. So to try to simplify it down to points, because you're completely new to the project, during a day, everything will be building up to what's called on the end-of-day checkup. And during the day, the user will be able to chat with what's called a mentor, which is basically your life coach. It's your dedicated guy. The mentor is actually made up of a lot of bots, but they're acting as the same bot in iGraph.

12:59 - Eksno 
During the day, they will receive drip feed content. So for example, videos to watch. And they will also be asked to fill in information about how their sleep was, how they've exercised, how much they've eaten, and if they watched the video.

13:23 - Eksno 
At the end of day, an end of day check-in will be started.

13:29 - Eksno 
If the fields haven't been filled in, then before the end of day check-in starts, they'll be asked to fill in the remaining fields. On this screen here, you can see that there's sleep emoji and text fields. But it will actually just be the user telling the agent how much they've exercised. If they've filled in all of the information required for the check-in, it'll switch to the check-in graph, which starts going through and analyzing how the user is doing.

14:07 - Eksno 
Depending on how the user is doing, the mentor will comment on that and coach on that.

14:16 - Eksno 
The thing that you're gonna, the first task, which is pretty isolated from the rest of it, is that you're gonna be getting to start up is, where is this going? Here. Is creating this new part called a coaching session. So that will be its own graph. Basically, if the user is doing pretty horribly, it will start a new graph, which is called a coaching session. Where it'll act as a completely different persona for the mentor and the coach will basically go through, ask the user questions and try to get to the bottom of why they're doing so horribly, if that makes sense.

15:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah.

15:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

15:05 - Eksno 
You don't have to worry about the coaching being perfect or any of that yet. For your first task, basically just implement the structure for the coaching graph so that it's able to go through and simulate the start of a coaching session.

15:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes. Can you go through again like the task that I need to perform Yeah.

15:34 - Eksno 
So which IDE do you use? Which editor, text editor, for coding?

15:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
Visual Coder.

15:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

15:49 - Eksno 
Then this may be a little confusing. But yeah, I use Neovim. You can see the file tree on the left here. Yeah. Yeah.

15:59 - Eksno 
So yeah, to run you through the structure of the product. Have you worked with SvelteKit before?

16:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
SvelteKit, not yet. I have worked with Svelte, but not SvelteKit.

16:11 - Eksno 
Okay, yeah, so the main part of the code is in the source folder, as per usual. In routes, you have all the URL routes, so you can go to like, slash admin, and then you get to this place, admin slash prompt, you get to this place. You don't have to worry about this code too much in the routes. You can ignore the routes folder for now. The folder you need to care about is lib, specifically lib server AI. Here's where all the AI code is, so all the link chain. Yeah, cool. The file that is called to begin with when the user sends a message is this run function.

16:53 - Eksno 
Okay. This run function creates a graph which is in the graphs folder. It's the index here. This create graph function switch cases depending on the profile state.

17:11 - Eksno 
and uses the appropriate graph depending on the profile state.

17:17 - Eksno 
The agents will be given a tool to be able to switch the profile state. So for example, in the coaching graph that you're going to be creating, at the end of the coaching, the agents should call a tool to switch back to the sharding graph.

17:36 - Eksno 
Does that all make sense?

17:39 - Eksno 
Yeah, so I've already gone ahead and modified the enum here. So you can see, and have you used Superbase before?

17:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I have used Superbase. Perfect.

17:53 - Eksno 
Yeah, here in profile, you can see there's a state and it's basically just an enum of which graph to use. So I've created a new enum coaching here. So yeah, you'll just need to copy one of these switch cases and make it coaching instead.

18:10 - Eksno 
I haven't updated the superbase types yet, so it's complaining. In graphs here, you can see two folders, chatting and check-in. You'll be creating a new one called coaching, and then you can look at the other two for inspiration. Chatting is the most elaborate one, so that one's probably best.

18:35 - Eksno 
basically creates this function. This is like the core parts of the graph. It's just a create graph function, which creates all the agents, adds those nodes, adds the edges and returns the workflow. Then it's at the bottom here, where it's returned back to the run file. And we stream through it and upload the messages to the database, which automatically, through Superbase Realtime, streams the messages to the frontend chat interface.

19:11 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got the clue.

19:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry? I got the clue.

19:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

19:18 - Eksno 
Yeah, it's always scary trying to onboard someone into this complicated, weird TypeScript flow. But hopefully I'm doing all right. Yeah, yeah.

19:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

19:32 - Eksno 
So in essence, I think the only files you'll need to care about for today will be creating this new coaching folder and the graph and agents for that coaching graph and introducing this new case to the switch case where it awaits the workflow from your coaching graph instead. Yeah. Then you just import it from graphs slash coaching.

20:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

20:11 - Eksno 
Make an index.ts, which looks kind of like this and has a function to create the coaching graph.

20:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Any questions? No, no.

20:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
Perfect. The coaching graph functionality, like what it is expected to return the output like under the switch case for the coaching graph.

20:41 - Eksno 
Can you repeat that?

20:43 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like under the switch case, like the coaching graph, what functions do I need to create?

20:49 - Eksno 
Like what sort of conditions it is expecting to This is the function that will be run in the switch case, just with your own agents and own edges.

21:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, got it.

21:13 - Eksno 
So it just returns the workflow that's created, so the state graph objects.

21:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

21:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
The state graph, then the node creation, then the edges. Yeah.

21:28 - Eksno 
As for the agents and prompts to use for the agents, I think just kind of wing it. Make it emulate a coaching session. Don't put too much effort into it. The main point of this is to get the structure in place so that we can create tasks out of the structure and delegate it between more people.

21:51 - Eksno 
OK.

21:55 - Eksno 
Yeah, I've gone ahead and created a feature slash coaching branch for you. Do you have access to the GitHub repository?

22:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
No, not yet.

22:07 - Eksno 
I'Ll go ahead and add you. Could you send me your username?

22:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, yeah, sure.

22:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just a second.

22:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
I have pasted in the Meet chat my profile.

22:21 - Eksno 
Discord or Meet?

22:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
The Meet, Google Meet. Yeah.

22:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
This one?

22:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah, right.

22:43 - Eksno 
Their invite has been sent.

22:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I got the invite.

22:50 - Eksno 
Yeah, so to inform you a bit while you're accepting the invite and getting the repository on your system, we use PNPN for the web projects, as well as TypeScript, Eastland, and Predia.

23:12 - Eksno 
Have you worked with TypeScript before or only pure JavaScript?

23:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I have also worked in TypeScript as well.

23:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

23:25 - Eksno 
Yeah, do you have any questions for me now?

23:28 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I will ping you in the Discord if I have any.

23:32 - Eksno 
Yeah, perfect.

23:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Thank you very much for explaining the code in very simple terms. Thank you.

23:43 - Eksno 
Yeah, thank you for understanding them.

23:49 - Eksno 
It's always like it either takes like 10 minutes or it takes like 10 hours. First time we are heading to the new repository.

24:03 - Eksno 
Always a bit intimidating. No worries. We're not expecting any perfect implementation. Of course, it's your first days and weeks here. So it's going to take some time getting used to the project, understanding what it is. Because it's basically one giant, super complicated feature, which is the coaching itself.

24:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:29 - Eksno 
Are you comfortable talking with clients?

24:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, fine. I can talk to the clients as well.

24:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

24:44 - Eksno 
I'd like to get you in a meeting with the client pretty soon so that you can discuss with him how the coaching process should work and plan that out with him.

24:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, fine. Great.

25:00 - Eksno 
Have you used Read.AI before?

25:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Which one?

25:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
Read.ai. Meeting.

25:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, in the previous meeting I have been connected with that technology. It basically translates all the meeting conversation into a text form. Yeah.

25:23 - Eksno 
When you're doing meetings, which you are handling yourself with, could you please include read.ai in the meeting so that you can send the read.ai notes to us and we can watch the meetings? Yeah, sure, sure.

25:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
I will add that plugin to my meeting now.

25:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

25:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
And also, by the end of the day, I will be telling you my working status, like how much I have implemented.

25:57 - Eksno 
Perfect.

26:01 - Eksno 
I'll invite you to the partner Discord. That's where we have our conversation with the clients. There you should be able to post your updates in the public channel. We have a public development channel with the clients because clients really like it when they see that work is getting done even though they don't understand anything about what's being talked about.

26:31 - Eksno 
Just tell me when you've joined and I will give you the team role.

26:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes. It's loading.

26:46 - Eksno 
you Are you able to join the Discord?

27:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, just a second.

28:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, I have now been added to the Discord. This is working very slow at my end.

28:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Like the internet? Yeah, internet.

28:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

28:21 - Eksno 
Yes, I have been added.

28:23 - Eksno 
There.

28:24 - Eksno 
You should now have access to the channels too. You can see basically at the top of clients where you have a depth Inside there. There's a depth of where you should become Conversing about about us about the project that's updates and everything like that I Should I go back just more of the main channel where we speak and with the client?

28:45 - Eksno 
And the others, you don't have to worry too much about yet.

28:51 - Eksno 
Inside the HashtagAdapt, could you write an introduction message, just introducing yourself to the others, including the clients, as well as saying that you're going to be working on the coaching graph?

29:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

29:05 - Hasnain sayyed 
HashtagAdapt, right?

29:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, HashtagAdapt.

29:09 - Eksno 
In that message, you can also ask Kikun if he'd like to get on the meeting and discuss how the coaching graph should work. Yeah, fine.

29:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
I will put up the introduction about me here soon.

29:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, perfect.

29:30 - Eksno 
Also, if you don't mind, it would be nice if you added your photo on Discord as a profile picture. Yeah, sure.

29:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Now I will be adding.

29:44 - Eksno 
Yeah, is there anything else then?

29:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I will text you whenever I get stuck.

29:52 - Eksno 
Oh, I totally forgot one thing. We use a virtual office platform called Gathertown. Have you ever heard of it? No, actually not. It's basically a virtual office where you all have your own desks, and you can walk up to each other, which instantly starts a meeting, as well as chat with each other. And it's a pretty cool application. It looks kind of like a video game.

30:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Great, great. I would love to connect with that.

30:27 - Eksno 
Yeah, I'll send you the link right now.

30:32 - Eksno 
Oh, that was the link that did not copy correctly.

30:52 - Eksno 
I sent you the invite link.

30:54 - Eksno 
Yeah, I got the link.

31:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Why it's not logging? Yes, I joined the group.

32:23 - Eksno 
Yeah, so while you're on working, we'd like you to be on GatherTown because then we can see when you are online and we can always walk up to you to start a meeting if we need to.

32:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

32:39 - Eksno 
It's kind of to emulate that instead of being in an actual office where you can kind of just go over to another guy's table and start speaking with them without having to go like, hey, do you have time for a meeting? Yes, I have time for a meeting. When would you like to do the meeting? All of that. You can just walk up to their desk and stuff.

32:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

32:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
That's great then. Yeah.

33:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, then I will start to work and I will update you whenever I get finished.

33:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, perfect. I'll see you then.

33:27 - Eksno 
Good luck.

33:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Thank you very much.

33:29 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

33:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Have a great day.

33:31 - Eksno 
Have a great night.

33:32 - Eksno

Fri, Jul 12, 2024

0:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, how's it going?

0:06 - Eksno 
Morning, guys.

0:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hi there. Hey, Hasnain, how are you? Yeah, I'm all good. How about you?

0:18 - Eksno 
Hey, how's it going? Just got my headset connected.

0:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, my ears are a bit funny. I feel like I'm underwater. I don't know why, and I can't pop them.

0:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, my audio, you sound very weird to me, but I'm sure, I know it's my ears rather than that.

0:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Both of us?

0:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, yeah, no, it's me, it's completely me. It's my ears that are toast. I don't know what's going on with them. Cool, so let me see if you see, have you seen this document? Is it Hasnain, is that how I say it properly, Hasnain?

0:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, yeah, right.

0:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Perfect. Cool. All right. Let me see.

1:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you see that?

1:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes.

1:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So have you seen this image before, this process flow?

1:19 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, I think.

1:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the idea is that during the day, there's the mentor, which is being a bit more directive and telling people, like, watch this, do this. It's very telling them what to do, almost. And then there's this coaching session, which I think is what we're talking about today and something you're going to be working on. And again, because this is all What we believe, obviously, when we start having users, that will clarify an awful lot of our understanding in terms of what it is. But a coaching session is a dedicated time. It could be somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes to go into something, because it's not something where all of these, if you ask the question, when you get the answer, is not that important, as long as you get the answer at some point during the day. So it's a very asynchronous communication. Where the coaching session is deeper, and it could get quite emotional. So you want to make sure that completes, or you need the time to do it justice. Now, with all of this communication up here and sending out the communication, text, I think, is totally fine, asking for something, something to come in back. My concern is that a coaching session feels very unnatural to be texting. It wouldn't be something that people would naturally do. They would normally talk. So one of the concerns or the questions I have is, how do we do both the user and the bot agent speaking? Now, I don't think it needs to be visual. I don't think we need an avatar. And I'll give you a demo of an avatar. But I don't think we need that at the early stage. But we definitely need to probably do voice. So there's two of them. Let me show you this.

3:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Have you used character.ai before?

3:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, actually not. OK. So I'm just going to sign in. I thought I'd already signed in.

3:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. I think it's this one here.

3:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I could say.

3:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you can see that it's doing text and voice. It's quite good. There is all of these different.

4:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, voices.

4:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Interesting. She hasn't changed.

4:07 - Eksno 
I'm not sure if it's only me, but I couldn't hear a voice. Kudu has now. No, I can't hear the voice.

4:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, interesting.

4:28 - Eksno 
For me, the mute stream button is grayed out. So I'm guessing there's no audio on the stream for some reason.

4:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, but again, it's coming out over my speaker. So I would have assumed my microphone picks it up.

4:40 - Eksno 
Oh, OK.

4:44 - Eksno 
I think computers are pretty good at filtering out audio. It's playing itself now. Wow. Why you can't hear me for example.

4:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So anyway, so that, that is car to the AI voices. Uh, so this is, um, I don't know if you're going to be able to, um, so this is a demo of a startup that I was speaking to. Um, she's a pretty impressive young Irish girl and she's doing some really cool stuff. So can you.

5:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you guys hear us?

5:22 - Eksno 
No. No.

5:26 - Eksno 
Are you able to allow the audio to go through the screen on Google Meets? Turn it on when you're streaming or something?

5:34 - Eksno 
How do I do that?

5:37 - Eksno 
I haven't done it before. Usually I'm screen sharing code, not audio.

5:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Google Meets.

5:43 - Eksno 
Share.

5:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
How bizarre. I had no idea that it wouldn't.

5:58 - Eksno 
Click present now. You will see three options to present. Click an option that says Chrome tab. Select from which tab you want to share. Oh, so you have to share the specific Chrome tab instead of the entire screen, it looks like,

6:11 - Eksno 
Ah. OK.

6:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to try it one more time.

6:26 - Eksno 
Yeah, now the mute button isn't great.

6:28 - Speaker 0 
Hi, this is the Sunset Hotel reception. How may I help you?

6:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you guys hear that?

6:34 - Eksno 
Oh, yes.

6:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide me with more information about your request? Would you like to make a reservation or do you have a question about the hotel?

6:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's your biggest room size?

6:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me check that for you. Our largest room is a suite that can accommodate up to four people. It comes with a separate living room and bedroom area and it's perfect for families or groups of friends. Would you like to book a suite or do you have any more questions about our rooms?

7:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you can see they provide an API that we would just send the text to, and it does that. I've got to change tabs now for a second. So if that's their current model, there's a new model coming out in about three weeks, which I'm going to show to you now.

7:24 - Eksno 
Can you see that?

7:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's starting.

7:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, yeah. Now it's visible.

7:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this here, this is her on the left, and this is the model on the right.

7:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you can still see quite that it's still a computer model. These are the two founders on the left. The one on the right is actually a generated model. It's not real. You can sort of see some of the detail in the hair quite isn't there. The eyes are not 100% the same. But compared to the previous version that you just saw, pretty bloody impressive.

8:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

8:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, and the big issue with all of these things is lip sync. Lip sync is the number one issue with any of these things. And they're really getting quite close to it. Um, so these guys are really interested in, in having companies use their product and the coaching feels like something that will be really appropriate. Um, but I think we'll look at that at a point in time. So if I just go back to.

8:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where is it? Oh, there we go. So if I do here live coach, it goes like this. Good morning. How can I help you today? Can you hear that?

8:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

8:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, I am struggling getting to, even typing this feels weird. I'd much rather talk to it.

9:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
And what it does is it times to put the text, and then it was doing that before. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with getting to the gym. It can be difficult to maintain a workout routine, especially if you're feeling unmotivated or pressed for time. Something that might help is to set specific. Sorry?

9:26 - Eksno 
It sounds almost angry. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling.

9:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, the intonation is not always perfect. And there's something fundamentally annoying about this style. I was speaking to somebody about this. And I don't know what it is, but I think it's something related to it. The agent has never experienced going to the gym. So they're talking about it as if it's a theory. Not from the first person's experience.

10:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so when you're coaching somebody, it's very much you can share your own experiences. And there's something about this, the Thrive app as well, it's overly, it sounds really weird to say this, it's too coachy. It's not real enough. It's not giving you an opinion. It's not helping you. So if you look at the, well, I'll send you over the immunity to change workshop that we ran with the coach. That feels a bit more normal in terms of what a coaching session is. So Hassan, just to let you know, so there's a, there's a work by a psychologist called Robert Keegan and Lise Laje. And they've done this work called, it's called the immunity to change. So for example, if, if you had information that like, I know going to the gym every day or doing at least a walk an hour every day is really good for me. And right now, But I'm not doing that.

11:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so I have the information. So it's not a question of having information. It's a question of applying it. And what do I need to do to my day, to plan my day, or to understand what's getting in my, what story am I making up that's preventing me from actually doing these things? And that's what that workshop does. It goes into that and helps people understand why they're doing them, and then putting some actions in place to allow them to, change basically now in when as humans when we're coaching we might only speak to our clients every two weeks and so what happens is during the phone call or the coaching session people are very attentive and they're like yeah I'm going to do this yeah yeah and then after the call life takes over and then about an hour before the following call two weeks later they go shit I've got to do all this stuff that I promised my coach And so, but in the meantime, not much has changed. So what we're trying to do is if we can have the ability, we don't, we don't have a formal coaching session every day, but if we did between the mentor nudging you every day and the ability to have a coaching session, we're hoping that people will find it harder to not apply healthy habits. That's the, that's the underlying assumption.

12:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does that make sense?

12:28 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh yes, yes.

12:33 - Eksno 
One question, Cuan. The coaching session, it sounds like you mentioned the workshop of the Immunity to Change. That sounds like a very specifically aligned and good workshop to run. But I imagine each coaching session with the user would be quite different, right?

12:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Potentially, right?

13:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
And again, this is just my initial assumption. So what instigates a coaching session? So I think when we were previously talking about it, we were looking at this end of day check-in. I use sometimes the word coaching, and I don't think we're looking at that. So that's what the mentor is doing. If you have a work mentor, they're a little bit more directive. They say, OK, you need to do these four things today. They're telling you what to do. A coach never tells you what to do. That's not their job. Their job is to be curious and ask questions. And so I think we're looking at this hybrid mentor-coach type thing. So if we are noticing that either you're not applying, you're not recording your information, you're struggling, or you're doing something, that is the call to action to have a coaching session. So generally, the coaching session is going to have an objective. It's going to have a thing they need to talk about. Like, OK, you're not getting to the gym. Let's have a session as to understanding why. You're still eating sugary food. Let's understand why. And so it'll generally always have a topic. It's not a generic open-ended session. And the topic comes from the lack of engagement or the data or stuff like that. So we're saying, oh, wow. And so let's say most people's lives are not very consistent. And so you might find Saturdays because people went out on the piss on a Friday night. So Saturday, they just don't engage with the app. So we would then say, ah, OK, we're probably going to start having the mentor probably start having conversations with you on the next Tuesday to say, hey, listen, we know that on Saturdays, you really struggle.

14:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you want to see if we can set something up this week to try and change that? How do we make your Saturday really successful? And if they're saying yes, then part of that solution might be having a coaching session to understand What are they doing that's making them fail on a Saturday, as it will be? And that's the sort of dance between the mentor and the coach.

15:10 - Eksno 
If the user insists that, no, I like going out, doing whatever, partying, or whatever the entire day, not doing their tasks for that.

15:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think that just you know, resets people. Well, the point of that then is to reset people's expectations of what they're going to achieve in terms of weight loss. Remember when we onboard people, one of the other coaching sessions we're going to have is helping people understand why they're doing this and helping them connect to their reason for doing this.

15:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

15:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, actually that might be the first, it's part of the onboarding, maybe the why and helping people get to that is probably the better, use case, because I think it's narrower and easier to work with than the whole immunity to change workshop.

16:02 - Eksno 
You mean to implement now or in general?

16:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
The first coaching session will be to help people discover why they're joining. Why are they signing up? Why are they joining? What do they want from this? What does it look like when they've achieved this? Because that's the fuel that's going to help them do the difficult things and the hard things.

16:19 - Eksno 
Ironically, that sounds like a very similar workshop to the one we're going to be doing for intelligent It's not, it's not a million.

16:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. But it was one's around brand and one's a personal thing.

16:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

16:32 - Eksno 
So, um, I think a lot of like, uh, a lot of that should be directly transformed, uh, transferable to making the intelligence or intelligent.

16:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Intelli agent.

16:46 - Eksno 
Okay.

16:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So like I was in a meeting, what was it all day the other day, Tuesday with Dell and the video. I was in Dell's offices in London for an executive AI briefing day. And yeah, they did some work for the Texas governance state of Amarillo. They created what's called a digital human and their avatar was shocking, but they were saying, it's amazing. Like this girl's startup is way better, way better than what they've done. And, Yeah, just their ambition. They do agenic work, so multi-agent systems as well. So project managers with analysts and stuff like that. So this is where everything is going. And I think we just need to really show the...

17:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Actually, the one difference would be in this one, Your why would be a one-to-one relationship between the person and the coach. Even if the coach is actually made up of multi-bots, the multi-agents, the person would never know that. Where in the IntelliAgent brand workshop, you almost want to show that there's multiple agents working.

18:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because if we were running an agency, exactly like this call right now, Hasnain and you are providing different inputs into this session to me. And you're asked different questions. And that's, this is the experience that JP ideally wants for a tele-agent. So everyone's doing different things. And obviously, you know, you have your own independent ability to know when to say something or when not to say something, or his has an aim about to say something. Cause you can sort of see the body language change. Agents won't have that. So that coordinator supervisor agent that we built for ADAPT, will do that coordination and when to speak, not to speak, that's going to be really, really important. Where with Apt, it's a single life coach, so it doesn't feel like there's any coordination going on to the user. It's just one voice.

19:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

19:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Actually, I think we should focus on the why. Let me dig out some work on why workshops and how to help people get to why. There's some really good work on this that we can figure out. And then you can actually, well, rather than me assuming what you need, as you say, coaching is relatively organic, right? In terms of where the conversation goes and how you get there. And, you know, there's tech five wise and going deeper. And, you know, even in that demo of the, of the hotel room, you can see that, you know, I tried to do a session earlier on just to make sure it was working. And I said, can I book a room in December, 2021?

19:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now her response was, we're fully booked.

19:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now she's not wrong. A person would say, what the fuck are you talking about?

20:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's that level of humanness, reality, like we're not trying to be perfect. We're trying to be human in the conversation. And if someone says something stupid, The bots are too polite, right? They're very much, oh, I'm really sorry. Like, if you'd say to chat GPT, give me something, and it's wrong. You say, sorry, you completely got that wrong. Oh, yeah, I'm really sorry. Maybe you got it right, by the way. But if you say it got it wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where it doesn't, at some level, we need to start having an opinion here. And maybe that's the thing that I'm feeling is missing here. There's no agenda that's not trying to do anything where I think we are. We are trying to help someone get somewhere. And I think that's the difference. And I don't know what you need from me in terms of data or information or guidance in order for you to build that. Or is it more a case of you're going to just build the capability, and it's in my training and fine tuning of it that we will turn it into that sort of an experience?

21:12 - Eksno 
Yeah.

21:13 - Eksno 
So should we start with the yellow part of the coaching session, which is already in the diagram? Or should we leave that out for now and focus on discovering your why workshop after onboarding?

21:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the why one will be easier as part of onboarding, because that's an actual workshop. I think we'll get caught up in the mechanics of the workshop as opposed to the experience of being a coach.

21:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think the why is a slightly more narrow defined experience as part of onboarding. And it's a more discreet thing that we could demo to somebody as sort of showing like, hey, do you want to know your why?

21:56 - Eksno 
Could you explain to us what your why is, like what that is as a concept?

22:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's a deep understanding fundamentally of why it's important for you to do something. So there's an often used life coaching experience where this guy wants to go to university and the life coach is saying like, well, why? And he's like, well, you know, it's a long conversation, but I'm giving you the sort of short version. He basically just goes, well, you know, I didn't go to university and I've always felt my dad's didn't respect me for that. And so I want to go to university and prove to him and basically get his approval that I'm, I'm a capable man. And then the life coach will ask a very powerful question, which is what if he doesn't like, what if your dad doesn't respect you because you go to university? What if he already respects you? What to do at university?

23:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so that makes the person think about, well, why am I doing this? And it's like, you know, for on the health stuff, I was given, um, I don't know if you know my backstory. So about three, four years ago, I, uh, I worked for a company and we would get very detailed medical exams every two years. So you get MRIs and ultrasounds and stuff like that. And well, I was cured, I wasn't, well not cured, sorry, I wasn't, I was cleared of all the big scary shit like cancer. I had something that was called NAFLD, which is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. I was pre-diabetic, I had arthritis, I had high cholesterol, I had calcium in my heart, and I had a sixth one, I can never remember the sixth one. And for years I went down the, the, doctor's route of having pills. And it sort of worked a little bit and then it wouldn't, and then it did, and then it wouldn't. And then eventually I said, fuck this. I'm going to figure this out myself and figure out what's going on. And, um, I spent about a year researching everything and understanding actually high cholesterol is really good for you. Um, lowering your cholesterol is a really, really bad thing to do. Um, what they actually mean is if you've got a very high, what's called triglycerides, which is a very high sugary diet, and you've got high sugar in your blood, there's something as part of cholesterol process is an LDL and the LDL gets damaged by the sugar in your system. And then that damaged LDL is tiny and it goes into your arteries and that's where you get calcium buildup and it can cause heart disease. Um, So they say, oh, let's bring down all LDL. It's like, no, that's really dangerous. You need to not have sugar, basically, is sort of the punchline. So my why was, if I didn't change my life, I would probably be having a heart attack within five years. So I would have had a very big issue. So I've had, I've been very motivated. I've lost, I've changed all of my markers. All of my health has now changed and I've lost about 24 kilos. So I was slightly fatter than you see me now. My wife is doing it proactively because she doesn't want to get diseases that are very avoidable later in life. My sister did it because she hit 14 stone. So she just had it like, 13 a half stone was fine. 14 stone was not fine. She just, her mental image just went, I can't be that big. And so she changed. So we all have these triggers.

25:50 - Eksno 
Did you say 14 stone?

25:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Into real money. That's it. 14 stone is an Irish English weight category. So 14 stone is about 89 kilos. Okay.

26:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
And she is now 63 kilos. So she's lost about as 20 well. And so it's really important. Sorry, excuse me. It's really important that people understand why they're doing something, because that's the motivation that's going to keep them going through the tough times. So why do people get a job? Maybe it's because they enjoy it. But ultimately, it's probably because they need to pay bills. And when you're having a shit day at work and your boss is a wanker, and I'm not suggesting in your company, it's like this.

26:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
You've got this choice in the back of your head, like, okay, well, what do I, why am I here? Am I here to be right? Am I here to get paid? Am I here to, you know, change the world or not? And invariably you're like, I'm here to get paid. So shut up, do what you're told.

27:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you understand your why, invariably I often forget my why and I get into arguments with shitheads and I don't like working in companies, but it's really important that people understand why they're doing something so that most weight loss programs fail because people don't understand why they're doing it. So what will happen is the data says that most people who lose weight within a year, they put it all back on because It might be, and maybe it's right for them. Maybe they they'll go, I need to get to a wedding. I'm going away on holiday. So it's a very short term goal. And there's a difference between like the journey of losing weight and maintaining weight are very different. And people have this journey or program to lose weight, but not to maintain it because they don't have a why anymore. So the why was to get skinny, to get into the dress, to go on the beach, to go to the wedding. Fine. You've achieved it, then what happens? Well, you just got all your bad behaviors come back and all the weight comes back. So both of you aren't, aren't here yet, but once you get up after 40, shit doesn't bounce the way it used to. Like the hangovers are worse. Food hurts more. You know, once you've got kids, you'd sleep less. Life is different after 40 and after 50 and 60, it gets, it gets even different, more different. So this is for people who know that they want to change for a short-term reason for this initial weight loss. Part of this why is also educating them over the 10-week program that actually the stuff that we do today when you're 40 and you're 50 and you're 60 really, really, really helps when you're 70 and 80. It stops you living the last 15 years of your life in a fucking chair or a bed. And so this is the journey we want to take people on. But initially, it's understanding their first why. And then in the program, we will educate them about looking at a longer-term perspective. Because if somebody comes in and says, I want to lose weight, and we're like, yeah, that's sort of important. But actually, the real goal is what you're doing when you're and 80. They're just going to go, fuck off. That's not what I'm buying. I'm buying weight loss for today. And so we need to understand that and connect them to that. Because also, what we'd expect then is the mentor, if someone's struggling, is you're going to tap into all of that information from the coaching session to say, hey, do you remember that thing you said about this? That's really important for you. So tap into that memory when you're deciding what you want to do tomorrow. So that's where the mentor is going to be using information from the coaching session to cheerlead and to support them in their journey.

29:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because at the moment, all the demos are very isolated. They're very independent. They don't have the context of the user. Because we don't have it. It doesn't exist, right?

30:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

30:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, did that profile worksheet I sent over, was that useful?

30:08 - Eksno 
Yeah, it's very useful. We've only added what we've needed until now. We can add more, but I'm a little afraid of adding too much information too early, where it makes it harder to test the things that are currently being implemented structure-wise.

30:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, makes sense. So I suppose the question I have for this is, I think we have to try the why as a voice conversation.

30:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's a very unnatural thing to do texting.

30:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
And my concern is, is that if we If we approach this through text, now I'm proposing that we do the character.ai model where it's text with voice.

31:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ideally, it will be the user speaking into it as well. And that can just be another voice to text. So we've got text to voice and voice to text. That would be ideal, but I don't know I had a quick look and there is stuff on hooking face. I'm assuming LandChain has its own capabilities around that as well.

31:48 - Eksno 
Yeah. We'll have to look into that, because I think integrating voice will probably increase the scope by a fair bit.

32:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why? Because that's just a mode.

32:07 - Eksno 
If there's just an API we can plug in there, then it's really easy. Then, yeah, no problem.

32:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, I'm just looking here, there's lots of people talking about using lots of voice agents with Lanchain. You can use Google speech to text. There's a medium here for article on how to build an advanced voice assistant with Lanchain. So this is not cutting edge in terms of we're not the first people to do it. And so I think other people have done it.

32:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not saying, I'm not trying to overly describe it being super easy, but I think my concern is if we do the text and I can hear almost your voice saying, well, let's just do the text and get the thing working because that's easier and we know we can do that. It's polishing or making the wrong thing right. Making the wrong thing better, like proving that we can do this on text doesn't actually, may not be a usable, Yeah, it may not be a useful experience because I think it has to be voice.

33:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
A coaching session. It just, it would be.

33:20 - Eksno 
Have you worked with like voice before using Langstone? Uh, actually not yet, but yeah, we can find the solution. Yeah. Then I think probably you, Hussein, can look into integrating voice synthesis into the coaching graph and basically just make a demo of how we can integrate voice into ADAPT. Because if it works for the URY workshop, then potentially we could just escalate that to making almost entire ADAPT optionally through voice.

34:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and again, I think it'd be good to do some proof of concepts on it. Now, in my simplistic head, all the voices is translating text to voice. It's not actually, the voice has got nothing to do with the functionality or the features. So we might find out that actually getting it working on text It's totally fine because all voices is a wrapper. It's a veneer on that. So actually we don't need to do voice on day one. We can just do text. But I think there's also the experience of somebody talking and hearing it is different. And I think if we get the text version too good for text, it sort of contaminates the spoken version, if that makes sense.

34:55 - Eksno 
Yeah, I think it has to mean that you could probably get that voice demo up and running, then we'll have a lot more context to run off.

35:06 - Eksno 
Because if it is just a wrapper, we can slap on them and it doesn't increase the scope by a lot. And it should, yeah, we should move forward with voice. Yeah, we'll go and start finding the better solutions for the voice. Yeah.

35:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think there's quite a few. I just did long chain voice input, and there's quite a few. But with any of these things, I think it's important to know which one. I don't think we need to start getting into having a range of voices or being able to configure the voice and all that sort of stuff. I think we can park that for now. I think that's very adventurous. But there's a whole load of stuff here.

35:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I'm assuming there's also loads of stuff on Hugging Face. Yeah, there's loads.

36:07 - Eksno 
Yeah. What do you think, Osman? Do you have any questions or anything? No, actually not for now.

36:15 - Eksno 
I think I'm clear.

36:18 - Eksno 
Yeah, that's good.

36:21 - Eksno 
Could you get like, or make like a little text outline of the your why workshop and how that is going to work just in chat so we have something to refer back to and get started with?

36:35 - Eksno 
Yeah.

36:36 - Eksno 
Perfect. And also, if you could send us resources on running your workshop and all of that, that would be great.

36:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'm going to have to dig that out probably over the next couple of days to try and collate that in terms of how that works.

36:50 - Eksno 
Sounds good. So we're going to park the coaching session that spawns out of the check-in for now, then?

36:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and we focus on this instead. I think maybe the first thing is just to focus on the speech stuff. And generically see what that overhead is and how difficult that is.

37:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
As and when you find anything good or bad, please share it. I think we love the transparency.

37:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
As we're all remote, sometimes it's difficult to know or feel stuff is happening. It's really nice when we can see all the conversation. Anything that you're finding or not finding or struggling with, the more you share, the more it's easier for us.

37:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

37:43 - Eksno 
All right. Anything else left on?

37:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that's it. Yeah. Cool. And welcome to the team, Hasnain. And again, any questions at all, please drop me a line. I'm pretty much online almost 24-7. Yeah. Sure. Cool. All right. Cheers, guys.

38:13 - Eksno 
Cheers. Bye-bye.

38:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cheers. Bye-bye. Have a great day. Have a good one.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (27).txt"

Sat, Jul 13, 2024

0:44 - Eksno 
Oh.

1:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hey, can you hear me? I can, do you, Jack? Perfect. Bye.

2:51 - Eksno 
Will, can you hear me? We're in the Google Meet. I sent a link in Discord.

2:56 - Eksno 
Will, can you hear me?

2:58 - Eksno 
I sent a link in Discord to the Google Meet.

3:04 - Eksno 
Yeah, Google Meet. Yeah, I sent a link in Discord.

3:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, perfect.

3:11 - Eksno 
See you there.

3:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hey, can you hear us?

3:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What part of the world are you in?

3:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, can you double-check your microphone that seems to be a little worse than last time I I'm not sure you're using the correct microphone.

4:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry about that. I, uh, my VPN reset. Cool.

4:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what do you, what's the, what's the, Jonas, what do we want to get out of this meeting? I'm happy to do whatever is needed or just talk about stuff in general.

5:00 - Eksno 
Generally, Will is the new Smothkit developer. He's going to be coming onto that, getting familiar with our tech stack. So basically, now we have the capacity to make all the UI, UX changes that you were requesting previously that we didn't have time to focus on at those times. And also the UI, the new piece of UI that we're developing, which is the to-do applications that's check-in item manager. So that you as an admin can add and edit check-in items that are mandatory. And also the user can add their own check-in items or to-do items throughout the day.

5:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's take it back out 10,000 foot and see what we're trying to do here. So ultimately, this is about, and again, I'm just making this shit up as I talk now. So challenge me and see what you think is good or not good.

6:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I've just woken up, so I'm still tired.

6:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
The interface itself is going to be really interesting to figure out what is the right blend of traditional web pages that I navigate to push something that we push to the user, and they can click, and they can just input versus chat versus talking.

6:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
And when we originally did a lot of the UX and the work, like, Will, have you seen the original wireframes and stuff?

6:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, let me see if I can show you something. Sorry, I'm trying to find this now.

7:06 - Eksno 
Well, can you see if you can lower your volume a little bit? It still seems to be a little too much.

7:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it. How about this?

7:19 - Eksno 
Is this better? Yeah.

7:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:20 - Eksno 
That sounds perfect to me. Okay. Thank you.

7:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

7:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry. I'm just trying to find stuff that's not working for me.

7:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
That is a very interesting email.

7:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's the story behind that? I made it during early 2010s.

7:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Back in the days, I think bands like Linkin Park, Green Day. Yeah, those were the common stuff and everyone's all emo so I was... I was a part of that emo phase. I just did not change the email address. It's like a memorial to a time when I was an emo.

8:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Nice. Good story.

8:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me... I'm getting closer to this now. Right.

8:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I'm going to show you is the legacy thinking. So you want to sign where we've come from

8:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

8:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me know when you can see that screen there.

8:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Can you see that?

8:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep.

8:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I can see it now.

9:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we're The idea was it was going to be a website. You have this sort of sense of 10 weeks or 12 week program. Across these four pillars of eating, moving, sleeping, and mind. So it was very traditional. You'd have a daily dashboard and some weekly content. So this is what it would look like on a daily basis. You'd have this sort of where we are in the week, what's your focus for the day, some motivational content, some video, some education. And then these actions that you had to do to track your calories, your walk, your sleep, and your mind. Or update your profile stuff like that. So this update your profile was very similar to LinkedIn where it basically says your profile is 20% complete do more. So that's sort of encouraging you to complete your profile and The idea here is that you've got you sort of here's my progress of moving Over by time I can see my reports I can see my progress. So this was the the the interface, you've got sort of achievements and the badges to say, hey, you're doing really well. You're on day one of 84. So where you are in the overall program. And then this is just where you are as it was a calendar type thing. So as a high level, does that sort of make sense?

10:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

10:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Still making sense.

10:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, that was before we were considering chat as being an option and the AI. So that was when it was just a standalone LMS website. It was a learning management site. So now this is what that has come into in my head. So this is the, and again, this is not complete. This is just me thinking with my brain. I don't know if this is accurate, So the idea here is that this is your daily quote, like what the focus of the day is. So it's bad habits. Then the mentor is speaking to you. It's like, welcome to day 10. This is what we're all going to do today. Here's a video that you should watch. And then here are some input boxes, sleep time, wake time. You wouldn't put all of this in in one go, by the way. It would be progressive over, this is a conversation, not just spamming you in the context. It's just showing the different modalities of having text and buttons to engage with the user.

11:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if we're now saying, for example, when you sign up your profile and you go, Right.

11:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you drink coffee? I do coffee. Well, if you drink your coffee, well then we'll give you a reminder that around one o'clock or about nine, 10 hours before your bedtime, we would suggest that you don't have any more coffee. So that's a reminder, but that's built into the system. But if you were chatting and you said something, for example, like, Oh, I've got a really busy day tomorrow. I'm not going to be able to get my walk in.

12:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the agent said, are you sure? Could you get off a station earlier? Could you walk a bit this? I was like, actually, I could leave earlier. Would you like me to set you an alarm for that? Yeah, great. So that alarm then becomes a custom to-do item, in essence. It's just a thing to remind you about.

12:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
If we know, for example, that you're going to do the weather, or say you're going to do a walk, and you wake up in the morning, and we know for your area that it's going to rain from 4 o'clock, we might say, hey, in the morning, hey, it's going to rain around 4 o'clock today, so try and get your walk in earlier. Would you like me to schedule a time for you? And it's like, yeah, remind me around 10 AM. No worries. I'll remind you. So that becomes a custom to do. And you might say actually as part of this which we don't really do as part of the program It's saying I now want to go to the gym Monday Wednesday and Friday at 9 a.m. Or 10 p.m. Whatever doesn't matter Okay, I can track that for you and I'll remind you about that. So that would become a custom thing. So you're not necessarily Tracking the progress of us we can do but it's more about just becoming a useful point of good things I want to do, or new habits, and that I can get reminded for them. And if I want to track them, we can ask to track them as well. But you don't have to track any of your custom ones. You can certainly ask them, but it wouldn't necessarily be something that you want to do.

14:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Does that sort of make sense?

14:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll try to summarize what I understood, what I've understood. So basically, the to-dos are the outputs made by the chat engine, like for reminders, for tasks, for habits that the user wants to do, and that they are saved within the database and they are, if the user wants it, they are recorded. To be used as reference by the user at a later point of time?

14:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
I think so.

14:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
But what I think with these things, it's more useful to not talk about the technical solution initially until we get aligned on what the user experience and the outcome is that we're trying to find.

15:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

15:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the objective here is that we have things. It's basically habits, right? And the habits have come from the system, or a habit can come from the user. A habit can have a reminder, and a habit you can track. If we have that core capability, we then can scale whichever way we want.

15:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So we start by letting the users create their habits first. Do I get that right? No.

15:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the program itself will have default habits. So if you really want to take control of your health, there's four areas that you need to be working on. Eating, so what goes into your mouth, your movement, what you're doing, exercise and gym, sleep, And then your mindset. So there's, there's habits that were forming around those four areas on a daily basis. So for example, it will be, don't eat any seed oils and walk for an hour every day. They will be the two basic ones. And then try to have good sleep hygiene, which is going to bed and, um, waking up at a very similar time every day of the week. So they will be the first three habits that we would be advocating for you.

16:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the system has those by default, because that's what we're recommending people. They're good habits to have. So through the course, people can add in new habits if they want to. And we might recommend habits beyond that. But fundamentally, you have the ability to have a habit. A habit could have reminders. So we're going to ask them about it, remind them to do it, and it can then also have the ability to track it. So you're saying, did you do it? What did you do? And then we can track that progress over time.

17:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Can you repeat the last sentence? I just need to put it in notes. Ability to have reminders, ability to do it, and the ability to So it's the ability to create a habit, remind about a habit, and then track a habit.

17:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
So tracking is, like, did you, like, reminder is saying, hey, remember to do your walk today. Tracking is saying, how far did you walk and how long did you walk for?

17:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then habits would have progress. So I just put an image in there Um In the discord channel and you can see uh, like that's a physical habit tracker You know, there's there's lots of different ways of Of people tracking their habits Trying to there was there was a new one, but I saw that was really good. I don't know where it is there was a, there, this, I can't find it now. I won't take up the call, but there was a sort of a calendar on a wall that you basically got to push a button and you say, I did this, I did this. So you had your habits and you could see it physically reminded. So the one that you're missing from the current interface, that's sort of the, sort of the day to day interactions, but there's no, at the moment, there's no sense of like the overarching progress. Like, where's the report? Like, Hey, you're, you're, you've done 15 miles so far. Brilliant. Um, on average, you know, if you look at saying in the first week, you were walking for an hour and you were doing three kilometers. Now you're walking for an hour and you're covering five kilometers. You've improved this amount. That's amazing. Well done. So the progress is also a really important one as well.

19:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

19:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I think we're starting to understand each other. So let me see if I got things right now. So for the next few days, I'm going to be creating a feature that allows me to create a habit that can be tracked and be reminded to users, right? And in a sort of habit tracker type of UI.

20:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I don't think there is a habit tracker UI. There is just the UI. There is our app, which is a chat with your mentor. And all you're basically saying to the mentor is, can you remind me of this? Are you guys thinking that this is like a separate page where I have a list of my to-do items?

20:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
At first, that's what I'm thinking. But from our conversation, do you want it to be like...

20:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I would imagine would be very useful to do then is that we need to create sort of a higher-level site map of high-level wireframes first before we build anything. Because there's definitely the chat interface on the mobile, right? But what happens if I want to go back a day? What if I want to look at my profile? What if I want to go in my profile? There's probably a page where here's all the habits that I'm tracking, where I could delete them, or I don't want to do this anymore. So there are certain things that chat is really useful for and other things that it's not very useful for. So seeing a list of all of my habits that I want to track or not track. So for example, you know, Like this is the iOS to-do list. I don't think it's this. This is not what I'm thinking happens. So I think it's most important that we figure out what the screens are and don't build them until we've actually agreed on what the wireframe and the user flow is. Does that make sense?

22:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

22:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because again, if we start building something as a single solution, you don't have... Jonas, remember we were talking earlier on about if you have a software project with 100 files and you want AI to migrate it, it will work on one individual file and that's fine. But then when it goes to the next file, it's got no context of the other one. And therefore, it doesn't actually fix the problem. That's what I feel we're at risk of here. If we just start looking at point solutions, rather than looking at the entire user experience, what is that? And that's what I started to do on Merle, where I said, well, this is what I think a day looks like, These are the chats.

22:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's take this back. Where do habits get created? When do they do this? So the stuff that we have, there is stuff that may come up in conversation with the mentor or the coach, that the mentor or the coach says, I can track that for you. Would you like me to? Oh, yeah, cool. Do you want a reminder on that? Is there something that you want to add to your daily tracking to track progress on? We think that's a good idea. Yeah, I would love to. Great. So that's just done through chat. There is no interface to do that. But what we don't have at the moment is, within this, is like, what happens? How do I see my progress on my walking over the last four months? There's no screens for that at the moment. So whatever mechanism we work on that would be the same for tracking the progress of any habit. What if I want to manually just go in and see everything I'm tracking? So it's not really a to-do list. It's more of a habit tracker. And maybe that's inside your profile. So there's a profile page where you've got literally all of your settings and all of the things. And you can delete habits, or you can show them But yeah, I think we need to explore what is the UX and the user experience here before we start building anything.

24:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it doesn't need to be high fidelity, right? I'm just in Merle. I can share this Merle with you, Will, and you can, by all means, jump in.

24:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me ask you, where is that?

24:38 - Eksno 
I also remember you showed me a proposal for how you could see back in time the progress, where you had a button on the bottom left, which was just the Adapt logo, which opened up the different tabs of Move Easily.

24:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

24:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
For example, let me share that with you now. Can you see this? Actually, that's not correct.

25:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
It needs to be here. Hold on a second. Where is this?

25:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, yeah. Let me share this.

25:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
So interconnected.

25:31 - Eksno 
Will, can you see this now?

25:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Uh, not yet. It's loading. Yep. I can see it now. Okay.

25:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the idea here, so this is, do you use Figma at all?

25:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

25:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I can share this file with you. So this is just the Figma thing. I'm just making shit up here, by the way. I'm not a designer. I'm just pulling shit together. Um, so this is the chat. This is the, you can see that this goes behind there. This is the, the, with the, with the, with the keyboard engage. So you can see how it moves up. And then the idea was, if you clicked on the Adapt icon, that would appear here as Eat, Move, Sleep, and Mind. And that's where you would see your progress. But actually, then, I can't remember who said it. Someone said, actually, you could move this away. And you could put all the four icons up here. And they could just be dropdowns, progress, tracking it there.

26:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
But then if you've got And more than just Eat, Move, Mine, Sleep, you've got Eat, Move, Mine, Sleep, Yours, or Custom, whatever.

26:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's now five icons. That probably fields a lot in there. But it's something that we can figure out.

26:53 - Eksno 
What is the scenario where a custom item wouldn't be under one of the predefined categories?

27:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's a very good question.

27:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think it would.

27:09 - Eksno 
Yeah, since then, we don't need a custom category per se.

27:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that's probably not a bad idea. Yeah, so for example, we could do this. I mean, that streak could actually be part of the messaging down there.

27:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's not, why is that not working? I think it's because of the layers on the left.

27:44 - Eksno 
The page you're moving it from is on a layer under the page on the right.

27:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
You get the sense, right?

27:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
There'll be some icon here.

27:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Whatever, we can figure that out.

28:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and I think that's sort of the structure. So how do you usually work, Will? Do you usually have wireframes given to you or designs given to you and you just build it? Or do you help design these solutions?

28:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It depends from company to company. Typically in startups, they don't give me wireframes. They just give me user requirements. But if needed, I can help edit the wireframes. Actually, I would like to ask you the question, how do you guys work from requirements to development? Do you create wireframes first, do you create the requirements, then just toss it to the devs?

28:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's very much a conversation in real time. So we haven't done any UI, UX stuff at all yet. So we started with the overall vision. We wanted to focus on having an admin interface to chat with the agent and train the agent. Jonas just reused legacy admin screens that are very basic, which is fine, which is totally fit for purpose. But now as we get into later in the project, now we've got to start talking about the actual app interface, because I think the app interface is going to change the experience of that. So I suppose one of the questions I'd have, ago, 10 15 years ago, you needed to get this interface absolutely pixel perfect in design because you built it once, and it was difficult, right? It was difficult to iterate. Now there's all sorts of frameworks, and it's super easy to knock up stuff. And if we wanted to move the icons, move them down there, move them there, that's like 10 minutes. It's seconds of work. It's not difficult. So the question I'd have for you guys is, how much of this do we need to get right in Figma as opposed to, Could we start with something like this? I mean, chat's chat, right? We don't need to re-engineer or re-imagine chat. We just don't need to do that. You've got Signal and WhatsApp and Discord. These guys are spending millions of pounds on good UX on chat. We could just lift those ideas.

30:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
If we're building, if we're using a framework that allows us to iterate quite quickly, then let's do that and just build it and sort of iterate the designs through using it. Rather than trying to get it right through Figma, if that makes sense.

30:50 - Eksno 
So instead of designing a final version to start off with in Figma, we create iterative versions that are functional and use those to test how the experience is. And depending on the experience, update the UI from there dynamically.

31:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, if you think about it, all you need initially is the ability to chat, the ability to input data, like a form or a button, like the sleep time and the yes, no. Take on my profile. To see stuff in my profile, it's not that important, depending on what we want to use it for. And then to see progress of move, mind, and sleep, like over time, how am I doing overall?

31:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this type of an interface potentially works to start going, where that banner could be your quote, but also could then rotate to being your streak and your progress. So this could be a multifunction window. The idea of back here would go to other days, but you could click on that day, and that could be a dropdown into different days of the week. So again. Luck to you guys to bring your expertise in what you've designed in the past to how we might improve this.

32:25 - Eksno 
To just give some context here, Will is the web developer, so he can do Everything web of standard web functionality, UI and such, and everything how it looks. But if the AI is highly involved, then he'll have to work with the others. For example, prompting the AI, making a message that also spawns buttons will be a very interconnected job between the wireless subkit and the Chinmay and Bewas working on the chat interface.

32:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the question I have then is, beforehand, this was a website, right? We weren't doing a mobile app before we engaged with you guys to work on this. So I'm wondering whether there isn't a website.

33:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Apart from the interface to control the agent and train the agent, I don't know if we have a website for the users to engage with. I don't see the value in that.

33:37 - Eksno 
Yeah, you mean a more extensive website than the chat interface and the mobile application?

33:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Say that again?

33:47 - Eksno 
You mean a website that's more extensive than the chat interface and the mobile application that we're developing?

33:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I don't understand that. The user will only use the mobile interface. The company, us, who are training the agents, we have the web interface that we have now to control admin and agent. That interface, obviously, it needs some tweaking. Is that what you want to talk about now rather than this?

34:20 - Eksno 
It was both of them. So on the admin interface, how you will decide which entry, which habits that are there by default. So you can add them and schedule them for what time of the day and all that, as well as how the user would add their own habits and how the user would track their own habits.

34:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay. Just give me a second.

34:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
My brain's got to catch up. I've got to write a message on this too.

34:51 - Eksno 
How are you holding along, Will?

34:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
I'm doing great.

34:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Fortunately, I have written some notes so I can go back to this after the meeting.

35:05 - Eksno 
Yeah, I also hope that over time, you two will be able to sync with each other pretty independently from me. And you can basically just tell me, hey, I'm making these UI changes. Hey, I'm working on this to improve the user experience and such. And of course, sync up with Jen, maybe, was the AI developers, if it's very interconnected with how the AI works.

35:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

35:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
The admin interface, it doesn't resonate with me that we're going to have an interface where we schedule things. Scheduling should be dynamic to the user.

35:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
There's no point in scheduling.

35:56 - Eksno 
There will be default habits, right? Like sleep time, wake up time, for example.

36:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry, say that again?

36:03 - Eksno 
There will be default habits, like sleep time, wake up time can recede.

36:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, there's habits, but we don't schedule them.

36:12 - Eksno 
The schedule, I mean, is more for one day, but should ask about it. But that's dynamic to every user.

36:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for example, if we know that you're waking time, that you're a late night worker, and you go to bed at 2 AM, and you wake up at 12, Assuming your day starts at 7 AM doesn't make any sense.

36:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So there's a level of dynamic engagement in terms of what a day is and when a day starts for each individual user. So there is parts of the system. So you've got nudges and reminders. Don't drink coffee. Come off your technology. Don't do any more work. Those things. They are scheduled. Yeah, we can customize those things, or we can specify those things relative to when someone goes to bed. So it's bedtime minus a certain number of hours.

37:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's fine.

37:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm finding my brain. I'm confused about where we're going with this. And I'm not entirely sure how useful this will be for Will if I'm sounding incredibly confused, because I am feeling confused. So I think we need to figure out, what is the scope of the question? And how do we answer it? So are we now talking about the admin portal functionality or the admin screen functionality? What do we need to do?

37:56 - Eksno 
I think that will be the easiest to start off with, yeah. OK.

38:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we need to then figure out what is the feature set in Admin, first of all. What does Admin want to do? And then we can figure out the UX for it. We've got to figure out what first, and then we figure out how.

38:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

38:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think it would be really useful to have a bit of a brainstorming session. I've got a call in 12 minutes, so I don't know if we're going to get to complete it now. But Will, maybe as an idea to support your onboarding, would be for you to start listing out what do you think all of the features that need to exist in Admin. Just a bullet list. It doesn't need to be anything fancy. We're not looking at wireframes at this stage, because I think we can then debate those things. Like Jonas there saying, oh, I think we need to be able to schedule them. I'm like, OK, interesting. That provides a really good conversation to saying, no, no, we're not going to schedule. They are going to be scheduled, but they're going to be scheduled dynamically. How do we do that? So I think I don't want to, I have no intention that you're going to get it all right In fact, I don't want you to get it all right. Because actually, in some of the things that you're seeing or thinking might be really cool, I have never thought about. And secondly, you might say something that I'm going, no, it's not that, and here's why. And that itself is a really good conversation.

39:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So happy for you to drop that into Figma. Or if you want to create a Google Doc, we can collaborate on whatever works best for you guys.

39:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

39:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I've worked with making business requirements before, so this is going to be a cakewalk for me. I'll create a Google Doc and send it in the Discord channel with you, everyone.

39:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Perfect.

39:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know if you're around working today. I'm around all day today as well, so we can do little bits. I prefer to work in small increments, like do something and review, do something and review, rather than doing big reveals, invariably that we deviate for too long. It's better off doing something small and doing small patterns of diverge, converge.

40:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

40:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, maybe that's the main action point for today. And then we can end this call if we don't have anything else to talk about.

40:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think that's cool. Yeah. So yeah, let me know if you've got anything to review or you want to talk about anything. I'm sure you're going to digest it and have a think about things, but let me know.

40:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

40:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll message you on discord then. Perfect.

40:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Have a nice day.

40:50 - Eksno 
One thing before that, I think it may also be good for you to go over the entire idea, the purpose, and all of, like, basically give an overview of the deck, why it exists, what it aims to do and such, with probably all of the new developers, because they've kind of been thrown onto the project pretty fast, or just, here's what you need to do.

41:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, I've done that for Cuan, I think I did that for and asked yesterday. So I agree with you, by the way. What might be useful, actually, is to have a call with everybody and just sort of do a level set and have other people talk about it as well and see what they understand. Because me, I know I know this. So hearing from Cuan and stuff like that and seeing are we aligned would be a really good exercise.

41:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

41:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think that would be helpful Who's gonna set it?

41:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is it you, Sir Jonas?

41:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Or is it you, sir? Of course, a little bit of formality.

41:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Mr. Cuan? I'm sorry, I don't know how to pronounce it. Cuan. Cuan, okay.

42:08 - Eksno 
I'll look at the time zones and try to find a time where everyone is usually online. I think one of the days is after 30 stand-up, so around 20 minutes ago on Monday.

42:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Maybe.

42:24 - Eksno 
So 8.30 BST for you, Cuan, would probably be a pretty good time to do the all hands meeting. Minus George, because he's in the opposite side of the world from me. So it's like almost impossible for us to get him to call anymore.

42:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. No worries.

42:40 - Eksno 
Whatever works.

42:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

42:44 - Eksno 
I'll try to sync that up with everyone.

42:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so just set expectations, Will. Sorry, I'm tired. When do you think you'd have the first version of this to look at? In terms of that initial thinking of what goes into Agent.

43:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I should be able to do it in 30 but I have church within the next few minutes, so about two hours of church. Perfect.

43:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
At some point today, great. Let's talk about it during the day. I think God has taken him to church already.

43:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not religious, by the way, just in case you were wondering.

43:49 - Eksno 
I think like the Philippines is Christian.

43:54 - Eksno 
I'll be able to show you something.

43:58 - Eksno 
Can you hear us now?

44:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we're clear. He's going to come back today. We'll catch up on Discord. Yeah. Sounds good. Cheers. See ya.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (28).txt"

Fri, Jul 5, 2024

0:42 - Jorge Lewis 
you I wonder if there's any echoes. It might be using my headset's mic.

1:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I'm not connected.

1:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

1:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's worse.

1:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Worse?

1:52 - Eksno 
Yeah.

1:54 - Eksno 
I switched to this instead of the webcam.

1:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, now there's an actual echo.

2:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

2:02 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I was getting used to the... Now I don't hear it. I mean, might as well. I need the light anyways.

2:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Is ready to join. I'm going to go get some sparkling water.

2:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Joined.

2:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hi, JP. Hi, very good. Very good.

2:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
Let me get the camera on.

2:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
You have 20?

2:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Good morning.

2:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Jorge is getting a sparkling water. What time is it there with you? 7pm. Good day today?

3:13 - Eksno 
Yeah, just gotta turn down the volume on the headset a bit.

3:24 - Eksno 
There should be better now. Yeah, much better.

3:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice.

3:42 - Eksno 
Yeah, so you've been testing the application of it.

3:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah.

3:49 - Jonathan Phillips 
I put the feedback on the thread, and obviously I've gone back in now to let you know whether it was a good or a bad response.

4:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
So when I'm doing that, If the response that I'm making is about maybe three parts of the conversation, do I just basically make it in one and then just say it's about maybe the next two responses as well? Or do you want me to do everything individually?

4:22 - Eksno 
When reviewing a response, the most important field that you fill in will be the ideal response where you For example, there's a question asked in one of them, and then the next comment by the agent is another question.

4:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
response is no response because it should wait for me to...

4:53 - Eksno 
That is an implementation issue currently. That's saying two questions at once. The thing more that you'd be reviewing is the behavior where... Let me see.

5:08 - Eksno 
Yeah, where it ignored that you were watching the footy later. Yeah, that's an ideal scenario to make an example, for example, that could be like, hey, you should be paying attention or asking more about what the user is doing if you want the bot to be more engaged. Yeah, cool, cool.

5:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, it's good. It's good to see it taking shape.

5:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
Do you feel it's coming along quite well?

5:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:46 - Eksno 
Uh, Jorge, you're ready. My wifi is really, really slow.

5:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

5:53 - Eksno 
Oh, uh, maybe it's a bit faster now.

6:09 - Eksno 
Um, I can just connect from the website on the phone. That's better. That's the password.

6:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Excellent.

6:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right, I'm back.

6:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I was asking if JP is supposed to be joining us, right? Yeah, I believe so. I think it's not in his calendar, so he might have.

6:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
I've let him know he's just away from his desk, I imagine.

7:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah.

7:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
So the progress is going okay as far as where you think your schedule is on the technology side?

7:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, we're a little tiny bit more than halfway through now. Things are looking good. We're going to start working on the LMS side of things. We're going to be able to do that in parallel with the rest of the AI features. So no problem in that part. So we just have to spend the rest of the five weeks or four, let's say four, the rest of the four weeks getting the features built in, all the capabilities for the bot. Cool. What LMSing?

7:46 - Jonathan Phillips 
Are you building your own LMS or are you plugging something in?

7:48 - Jorge Lewis 
We're using bits and bobs from other places.

7:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
What do you mean? We're using different tools.

7:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, an LMS is a combination of things like a content delivery system. Yeah, but we're creating the LMS itself.

8:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah? Yeah.

8:07 - Eksno 
The bits and bobs are programming language, CMS, and yeah.

8:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, you...

8:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Goodwin is here.

8:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello, hello.

8:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
Afternoon.

8:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, folks.

8:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
How's it going?

8:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, good, man. Good.

8:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Great. Yes.

8:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's get into it then. We were just talking a little bit about that.

8:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
About what? Oh, adapt. Oh, adapt.

8:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I didn't hear that word. It was like we were talking about something, and I was like, oh, that's nice.

9:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

9:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how do you guys, what would work best for you guys to run this? I know, Jorge, I took you through a little bit of the high level yesterday. Jonas, you haven't seen anything.

9:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm happy to run stuff, happy to sit back, observe, whatever. You guys let me know how best you want to run this.

9:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, we're quite flexible. I imagine you have a lot more experience doing these type of things than us. So if you want to maybe guide us and we can see how to go from there. Apart from that, we could go into one of the diagramming platforms along with Google Docs and go from there, just listing the things we're looking to build and then format it afterwards, just putting things on paper first. And then we're going to construct your format.

9:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think what we want to do, and JP, keep me honest, correct me when I'm wrong here. The point of this is we want to prove and be able to demonstrate something that people haven't seen before fundamentally in the space of marketing. And so in order to tease apart what those generic components are at a simplistic level. And obviously, there's loads of deep devil in the detail. We've taken the purpose of a, or the scope of a brand purpose workshop. And so a brand purpose is like an internal mission statement. It's an alignment as to why we exist as a company, what we want to do. So if we adapt our brand purpose and our mission statement, I've become one of the same thing. But a brand purpose isn't necessarily expressed externally. But in our case, it is. And it's, we want to prevent and reverse diseases that rob people of life. That's why ADAPT exists as a company.

10:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Anything you'd build on that so far, JP, or is that sort of broadly right? That's probably it, yeah. Without getting into too much specifics.

11:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's just trying to tease out a statement of why the company exists.

11:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, makes sense.

11:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
To do that, we're just going to step through the mechanism by which a brand purpose gets created in terms of the logical steps. And then once we agree on the structure, let's discuss how AI plays a part on that. I think it's useful to ignore AI, first of all, in order to understand the flow, and then We'll talk about what a potential interface might look like and how AI plays a part in achieving the outcome. Does that broadly make sense for J&J?

11:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

11:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me share my screen.

12:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you see that, guys, now?

12:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Cool.

12:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Are you guys able to draw on my screen? I know certain apps have the ability to draw. Can I allow you to draw? No. There's a whiteboard jam, but I can't. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Actually, I should probably change these into a different color, because they sort of mean something else. So the two orange ones are, we think there's a potential significant devil in the detail issue if you're a startup or an established company. But irrespective, the flow is the same. And we'll get into that nuance difference later in the process. We don't need to get caught up in that at the start. So it's actually quite a simple high-level structure, which is what the white box is for. So we're doing a brand purpose workshop. First of all, like with any workshop, you set the context. Pretty much exactly what I've done on this call. We haven't done anything. You guys haven't even really spoken yet, which is totally fine. Just setting the context so everyone knows why they're here and what the purpose of it is. It's exactly what we would do in this case.

13:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then the next step is about information gathering. And this is where we And that royal way would be JP plus bots would be asking the customer, the user, a lot of questions like, why did you set up the business? What pain points are you fixing? What jobs do your client needs you to fix? Are you global UK?

13:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's an organic number and type of question sets here, but the outcome is to best understand the purpose of the business. And ultimately, for us to get a sense, are they doing this for a passion or is this for profit? Now, in a real-world workshop, that's actually not that difficult to discern, because you can tell it from the tone of voice and the body language and the just, you know, You can ask people who are really passionate about something a single question and you sort of have to shut them up sometimes because they're just you can just see like actually you can leave the fucking room and come back in half an hour and they're still talking because it's so much important to them. You can also get absolute knob ends who do that. They just talk because they're talking and they're not passionate. They're just the filibusters and but we have that innate ability as humans to understand the difference between passion and bullshit, but that's going to be super difficult for technology, but we'll come back to that. So there comes a there comes a point where the information gathering process allows the receiver, so that would be a JP type person, to start formulating ideas in his head of what the statement might be.

14:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
And there isn't just one answer, but there could be a couple of them. And you could say, hey, how about this or this? And what bits of that one do you like or dislike? And the same for this one. And both of those are actually really useful. Saying no to something is as useful as saying yes to something. In fact, saying no is somewhat more useful in different cases. And through that iterative process of suggesting ideas or concepts around the purpose statement, getting customer feedback saying yes, no, no, yes, bits, I like that, I don't like this. You iterate on it and then that process just naturally comes to a conclusion. You just stop asking questions because you feel satisfied. And then there would be a statement that's in this gray box that we would believe would be a candidate brand purpose, certainly something to start working with. So I'll pause there. I've got more to give, but I just wanted to see if there's any questions for anybody yet.

15:58 - Jonathan Phillips 
Can you make those two red boxes, can you make the text white so they're easier to read? Thank you.

16:13 - Jorge Lewis 
the the the fifth other is that for someone like JP, knowing what questions to ask to produce the information that we need is very innate. It's built up over all his experience. So getting the bot to know, okay, we should be asking, considering I have asked these three questions so far, I'm missing this, but this is never going to be, if you don't want it to be explicit, that's going to be going to be tough.

17:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I mean, I would, you know, happy to explore the consequences of this a little bit here. But I, in the same way, when I work with chat GPT, one of the questions I ask is saying, hey, generate me x and ask any clarifying questions that you have in order for you to best answer that question. And it will ask me questions. And at some point, it stops. It feels comfortable. So there's some innate ability in the Gen AI LLMs to do this approach already today. Now, my understanding and my feeling is, through the RAG windows that we're creating in ADAPT, we ask questions. Would then say, yeah, that was a good question. But I'd also ask this afterwards. You stopped the process. I would have gone deeper. And through that right process of running this workshop, the same workshop, many, many, many times, I think JP will correct and reinforce the bot to go and ask the sort of questions that he would. Now, the journey from A to B, so where the customer is now to get in their brand purpose, or sorry, for the phase A, which is for JP to understand their world, It's the same outcome. The path there is not the same.

18:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
And there would also be, you know, JP would know, for example, what client he's talking to. So, for example, when we do our AI talks for an hour, and we're going to go and speak to a travel company, we will A, go and do some market research on them. We'll know about them, where they are, when do they incorporate. We might look at their company profile. We might look at their accounting books. We would look at whether they're in the press. So we would have some what's called outside-in point of view on that. And we'd have to put it in the back of our head. We're not presenting that information. But we're using that to basically say, oh, hold on a second. So you're an eco-startup? Then why are you in the news saying that you're working for Shell? That doesn't tally with me. Why is that? So let's say more about that. We're not judging them. We're getting clarity so there's no contradictions and paradoxes in what we're doing. So that was the intention of these red bots, which we've marked red potentially to put out a scope in the first phase. But the idea is that once we understand the domain name or the company name, the market bot will be looking at externally to try and gather a perspective on that company, or the founders, or both. What do they say on LinkedIn? Do they post? What can we know about them? I think that's potentially very useful.

20:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
At the ideation stage, that's another bot that is coming up with ideas, and you might have a Generally, when I've worked with clients on this process or similar processes, more realistic, there's all sorts of different games you can play with people to come up with stuff.

20:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a two-sentence process, and I would come up with the first sentence. And then everyone changes, and someone else has to put the second part of the sentence to make the story wrong because it's funnier. And then from that, some weird shit happens and you, Oh, that actually does a little bit there.

20:59 - Jorge Lewis 
That'd be interesting. I see what you did there for it to be wrong. And then you said funnier.

21:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it all works. Um, and that's the whole point is to be creative because some of the, sometimes like JP helped us come up with value stack. His process was a whole load of his experience and his innate ability and his brain does to suddenly go try this. And so. Part of that process is what we want to do here. Now, if I skip over to potential interface, if you can see this screen here, imagine on the left-hand side here, there's a whole lot of chat going on, which is the asking questions, just the running of the workshop. And then there's persistent assets or bits that are getting created. So there's a point in time where you see on this screen here, We have enough information for the bots to start generating potential brand purpose statements. And one of them could be a really creative, out there, risky point of view. One might be a really consultative point of view or a really safe point of view. So you've got extremes. And from extremes, you want almost polarizing statements so people can react to it and say, yes, no, whatever, to bits of it or all of it. And the idea is that you'd be clicking and seeing different versions and saying, it's more this, it's more that, it's this, it's that, it's this, it's that. And again, there might be a values exercise here where you do, are you more this or this, that or that, this or this, that or that? There's a set of, where are they? Let me see. The brand value card deck. Brandec. So this is an exercise that I used to run. I don't know if you can see it. So if I zoom in here, you've got black and white. And so you basically give every, you take two cards and you basically say, let's say you had calm or energetic. And they're completely random what they are. And you say, which one more are you? Do you want to be calm or energetic? We're energetic. Are you historic? Are you everyday? We're everyday. Are we universal or individual? Now we're going to be universal. Are you going to be futuristic or nostalgic? Curious, organic. It doesn't really matter what they are. They're just choices. And so you could do this exercise, again, to start giving people more content into how they see themselves and how they see the world, which then allows us to build this purpose statement. And then at some point, you coalesce on a statement saying, that's what we are. We're happy with this as a first version. We'd also imagine that you would probably, at the start, and this could be pre-workshop or at the very start of the workshop, Upload relevant files like your brand deck, any company information that you have, data that you have, your websites, articles that have been written about you, whatever. It doesn't really matter. There's a whole lot of contextual data that we would say, hey, please add that to give us some insight. Now, once you have this, this is where potentially the scope increases.

24:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
My view was, if this is something that the customers coalesced and really likes it, but then you do a Google search and you find this is pretty much exactly the same statement as a Tesla or somebody else, and you're in the same space, probably not really good. So if I look here, Randox Health. If you look on the ADAPT website, we have ADAPT your health, your future. And we did that completely independently. Why is that not working?

24:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
They say help you protect your future, but I was in London the other day and there is a new advert that says, let me see if I can see this.

25:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Extend your life. Interesting, someone's sprayed money-making scam.

25:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, anyway, their new one on the London Tube is Your Health, Your Future. I'm like, fuck. Now, wouldn't it be really cool if, as we're building this, what we have a uniqueness indicator or a conflict indicator based on what's going on in the market? Just an idea to show lots of independent bots working. Because if I was working as a consultancy, You have the lead MD or the partner who's giving oversight and making sure we don't do anything stupid. You'd have the main facilitator, but you probably have three or four other people who are in the background listening to stuff, supplying, if I was the main facilitator, supplying me with information, which I then choose whether to apply or not and say it's relevant or not relevant. And that's sort of the model that we want to mimic. Now, if I bring this to life, And Claude really fucking annoyed me last night. I spent an hour trying to build. I was trying to play with it to try and come up with an interface for Adapt and coming up with it. And I ran out after an hour. It basically said, you can't do anything more. I'm fucking paying for you, and you've stopped me like an hour.

26:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's really frustrating as well, because it's sometimes four or five hours Beyond the time you're at now. It's not even like wait an hour. No. Yeah.

26:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, I was finishing this about 8 o'clock and it said 12 p.m Hmm. So what's good here is that AI breaks, but so you've got nice version control Okay, so there so back to 14. So you have the idea here of having eat move sleep inside the chat window So the idea here is on the left. I have a have a a chat of the workshop and then on the right hand side you you have the output that's persistent. Because if you chat, shit moves off the window. It scrolls up naturally. And so having an active or a persistent pane on the right-hand side makes a lot of sense. Having some form of version control, because we know anything organic inside Gen AI As long as you just keep on going forward and you're happy with the output, it's OK. But if you go forward too far in a way that it doesn't like, So this suddenly just broke. I've got no issues. But if I go into Inspect and look at the console, there's loads of errors. And then I can take those errors, give it into that. And now I'm doing all sorts of shit. So it's actually a bit easier for me to go back into. It seems to be, well, I'll tell you what I was doing. I actually had a version that looked like it was in an iPhone.

28:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
And yeah, this was quite an interesting one. But then you got the overlap, stuff like that.

28:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
There was an iPhone, and the iPhone wrapper just fucking broke it. And it couldn't recover. It was using some template or something like this.

28:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
But having the version control that I could build again from that point was super important, because AI is not tangible enough to, it's not, you can't engage with it enough to do anything about it. But this breakpoint of these version controls do allow you to jump off in different places. So I'm probably going to pause there. There's a million other things that we could add to this, but we want to try and sort of tightly bound the scope to look at this and saying, given this, which, by the way, is not different to what JP was taking you through the other week. It's just a very specific slice of that functionality, tightly bound. So for example, if we decide that there is five bots in this meeting, we don't have the ability to create new bots. We might hard-code them, for want of a better word. The scope of the workshop or the process of the workshop might be hard-coded.

29:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
If the delta to have this variable is 10% effort, we'll go variable. If making it variable quadruples the timeline on the cost, then we wouldn't do that. So we don't want to presume we're going down the hard-coded route, but there is an underlying assumption that it's cheaper, faster to get a working prototype out.

29:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what does, does that sort of make sense? Any, any, any sort of questions?

29:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And even, even for, for whatever reason, like if we make, if we've hardcoded the first one and for whatever reason, it's pissing rain.

30:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, did you let Shelby in?

30:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I've always been impressed with JP's background. It's quite modern. It's just a living room.

30:25 - Jonathan Phillips 
Oh wow.

30:28 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, my partner collects Emma Bridgewater pottery.

30:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't get it either, don't worry.

30:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
What type of pottery was it?

30:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry? What type of pottery was it?

30:52 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sorry, I'm losing it a little bit. Is that my audio, or? No, I can't understand it. I was asking what type of pottery it was. Hemp bridge water. Hemp? Hemp bridge water, I got it.

31:12 - Eksno 
I mean, here I can echo, by the way.

31:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm cooing.

31:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, yeah, this is a sister, that's why.

31:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Emma Bridgewater.

31:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, is that the artist?

31:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yes, it's a stylist. She does the...

31:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just like that sort of thing.

31:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
the sort of thing.

31:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold on, let me put you on full screen.

31:48 - Eksno 
I tried to do that and I couldn't.

31:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's not cheap, so we've got about 20 to 30 mugs and cups and they're about 15 to 20 pound each.

32:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Why we need that many, who knows?

32:08 - Jorge Lewis 
One day she's gonna end up with none. We're gonna wonder where they went.

32:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
Or 100, don't know, one of the two.

32:17 - Eksno 
I had one person in my family that bought like a bunch of pots and like, what are they called? Ceramics. And she bought them when they were like really cheap. And then suddenly a boom of like enthusiasts that wanted antique things popped up. And now she's like got a fortune in pots. Wow.

32:40 - Jonathan Phillips 
That's cool. That's very cool.

32:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I have muted you by the way. There's a bit of an echo.

32:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, does that sort of make sense? Hello?

32:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

32:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you hear me? There's still an echo.

33:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, there's still an echo.

33:04 - Eksno 
How's that appeared out of nowhere? I think it's gone now.

33:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Maybe.

33:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that any better?

33:09 - Eksno 
Can you hear me now?

33:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
I'm testing as well.

33:16 - Eksno 
Okay. Yeah.

33:17 - Eksno 
I think it's like a smart noise cancellation thing. That's like taking sampling from many seconds before, because you hadn't spoken in a while. It's called our voices.

33:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Wow.

33:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, so as I was saying, the worst case is we hard code the first one, and investors or users super love it, and they need another one within a few days. That'll be easier than making the first one, of course, because we'll have something already made. But of course, we have the idea that the first one is just to understand things better, and then we can try to see if it's more viable to make the builder.

33:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
I agree.

33:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how much of this? So there are like ADAPT has multi-bot, multi-agents. Obviously, they're doing different jobs. So what I want to try and do is just, if you can still see my screen. So I think this is useful for me also to understand how things work and the language that you guys are using. So if I go in here, so the check-in team, again, I might want to change some of the language here because it's not obvious to me, but we'll see. So the team is the root prompts for each agent.

34:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that right?

34:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you guys hear me? Yeah, Jorge.

34:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the root prompt is applied to all the agents.

35:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but that's checking a team. So for example, there's a root prompt, there's the coach, there's the analyst, there's the collector, there's the supervisor. So the supervisor, for me, between ADAPT and IntelliAgent, would be persisted in the sense that the supervisor is figuring out who can talk and when, when you've got multiple voices in the system. So that is still useful. The collector could be something that's taking the information from the chat and putting it into the persistent window, like which bits of value versus not a value, as an example. The analyst, not implemented yet, but that could be the market analyst or an A, another functional one. The coach could be the facilitator, and stuff like that. And then the root prompt is just the persona. So I think a lot of that structure can be reused for IntelliAgent. The tools, as I understand it, I don't know why they're not there yet. But tools are the hammers, the chisels, the screwdrivers that are used by the agents to achieve certain outcomes. So am I right in saying there was a weather tool That would be an agent that would then have access to call that tool to understand what the current weather is. Or we might have a tool to go scrape the web for company information.

36:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
So these are just a few.

36:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. So we have tools. So we have that structure now. We can just list out the tools that we want. Manage is sort of the feedback. And training of the bots, which we would do, or what manages the log of the chats that we've given feedback to. And then, yeah. So I think a lot of this gets us a lot of the way there with some enhancements. So the question is, is that true? Does that make sense? And if so, what, when would it make sense to do a logical deviation of the product line? So adapt forks out to do IA because there is still enhancements that we're making to adapt that I think materially benefits IA as well, IntelliAgent. So I actually see in the same way for me that adapt can then become a GCSE bot and can come a English, teaching English in Spain but if you strip out the specifics, there's a lot of raw capability here. I see the same for JP, like from ADAPT to IntelliAgent, I don't see as being 90% new work. I see it as 10 to 15% new work.

37:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because it's just in terms of how you see things playing with each other. So if that's true, then I think we should look at ADAPT's current timeline as the same as the IA timelines. And there'll be a common point where ADAPT matures enough that you then go, right, now we're going to tweak it specifically for IA, if that makes sense.

38:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

38:23 - Jorge Lewis 
As we all know, LLMs are pretty stupid. So figuring out, with that said, it's hard to predict how much is going to be able to be, how much is going to be able to, how much is going to be able to be reused.

38:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Because, for example, if we copy the graph from ADAPT to intelligence, to IntelliAgents, it could be totally whacked, for example. And that's another example is the reviews, instead of providing feedback for one message, we might provide feedback for a set of messages. So these are the things we'd have. So from ADAPT, we'd have to still break down quite a maybe the top 20% things that have been specialized for ADAPT and then rebuild it for IntelliAgent. Like we have all the infrastructure. You asked me this yesterday, Cuan, and I wasn't able to kind of give a clear answer and still yet until we kind of dive into the actual work. It's like, how much can be reused, all the ways we're interacting with the blockchain that can be reused, all of our experience, I would say, is a big part. Because now that we've done this, the experience we've learned in making this, the exact same thing could be applied.

39:42 - Jorge Lewis 
The main difference between JP's project and Cuan's project is the actual things the LLMs are doing, which is using line graph. And I would say that's the easy part. The hard part is making it all stick together. What do you guys think?

40:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, I mean, I, I sort of, I, I get that from, uh, I mean, yeah, I mean, the devil's in the detail on a lot of these things. I just, are we, do we agree though, that it's not starting from, there's, there's, it feels like there is a high degree of reusability. Obviously we know that there's going to be, you know, specific instancing on that.

40:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Yeah, I think 60% can be reused from ADAPT, I think. And that's the idea of 50% IntelliAgent has been built from ADAPT. And the math I'm kind of doing is get ADAPT, break down the specialized part, and then rebuild it up for IntelliAgent.

41:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
I suppose, what is that point of inflection between both products? Because ADAPT isn't fully mature yet, and there are definitely more things that we're building in ADAPT that I think IntelliAgent benefits from And I don't necessarily want to build them twice on both with the illusion of progress, because the reality is you're a small company. Actually, your company size doesn't make a difference. If you are working on two fronts, you are going slower than going on one. That's the reality. So for me, it makes more sense to everything focuses on adapt while as long as it's serving both products to a point that you then go, OK, this is now totally adapt onward. It's not really benefiting IA. And then that would make it potentially more logical to do a split at that point.

42:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
So are we saying that none of this is modular? So it's not a case of creating modules that plug together and taking several modules here and moving around. Is it all linear, that you'd have to then go to a point and then stop and then move that across I'd say interconnected modules.

42:44 - Jorge Lewis 
There's some connections that have to be made between each, but those connections aren't really a big deal. Yeah, not a not a big deal. In terms of being faster working on or the idea is that we can work as much as possible and adapt that into the point where we don't, we won't be reusing anything for intelligent, right.

43:15 - Eksno 
Remaking, I think to the point where we won't be remaking.

43:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, the onboarding is one system that would definitely be better off making for one. And then. Reusing for the other one. That's definitely one. By the way, JP, the onboarding I'm referring to is for ADAPT is the user onboarding and for IntelliAgent, it's the gathering all the info about the company. So upload all your documents, ask all the questions, and then get all those answers. That's the onboarding.

43:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So some of that would be reused.

43:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you look at the functional section, that onboarding would just be something that we could lift and shift and plug in. Like it's not part of the, you know, that, that, that shouldn't be something that delays, like in the same way you said, we haven't done authentication yet. Fine. I totally agree with that. It's important for when you start getting money and you start having real customers, but not important for.

44:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
The demo. The onboarding is not important for doing the initial demos. So if you look at the ability to actually just run the workshop, right? So we want to go in and a bot will then say, hey, ready to start everyone? Great, cool. And it would give some level of information as the context and information so that would just be like the coaching bot saying good morning whatever it would basically introduce step one is introduce the workshop and JP would say here's the seven points that are really important but be creative with how you express it okay cool That's step one. Then we'd start asking questions. Again, the coaching bot would then say, right, here's what I'm trying to do. It would ask those questions. Would be able to go in with the rag, which we could do right now today, and say, no, no, it's this, then that, and I'd ask this, and I'd ask this, and I'd ask this. I suppose the bit that's not there at the moment is good, bad, and maybe there's a new thing called relevant, or like, in an entire sentence, not just that it's a good response or a bad response. That's the orchestration or facilitation of it. When a human says something, we need to be able to say, this bit of the sentence is actually really important and go deeper on it. Or that's actually something to put in the bank of words or ideas that are relevant to then generating the, what you call it, the doodad. The brand purpose statement. So that would be an enhancement to the admin screen to be able to say which of the things that the person has said are something that you want to bank up and keep note of for later. And then the only other thing is we would need to turn one of the other bots into a copywriter bot. And you'd have copywriter one, copywriter two, who would have their own tone like one might be really fucking adventurous one might be a shakespearean one one might be a adam sandler one that doesn't really matter you you just come up with these different variations um jp would you see any value in doing a values workshop in this and so you more this or this this or this this or this yeah I mean it's very much a case of

46:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
um I don't know if the content matters that much at the moment. I mean, obviously it does for the workshop, but it's the mechanics behind it. I think that's the key. I think we can evolve that. Once we start to get the mechanics together, we can see how far we can push it.

47:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

47:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
Because what I don't want to do is start to say, yeah, get excited. We do this, we do this, we do this. And all of a sudden, it becomes a long list. So I think it's better to start and see how far we get, and then start pushing as we go. And then try and not cram as much in, but try and build on it. And then hopefully, the minimum output's good enough. But then the extra output we can add on, once we know we've got the minimum in place, that makes it very exciting.

47:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

47:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, I agree.

48:01 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I mean, it is easier for me to say, yes, I'd like a long list of stuff. And you go and say, tick, cross, tick, cross, tick, cross. That's manageable. That isn't. That's going to be hard. Then we can do that as well. But what I don't want to do is tie everything down and slow you down by trying to put too many ideas in your head to start with. I don't know how you'd prefer to work.

48:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So given that, sorry, go on.

48:31 - Eksno 
I think it would be good to get that proper long-term vision in our heads so that we can more properly define which of the aspects of that long-term vision with all the features and everything are most core to the application so that we can focus on creating the core of the application while still structuring it in a way that allows for all those future features.

49:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think it's, and let's see if you agree with this, JP. It's the ability to create multiple workshops. What we've talked about here is a single workshop. The ability to create agents with specific tools and jobs to do. And from the output from one workshop to feed into another workshop. Because with that, you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want.

49:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's what I think what I've just said is what JP took you through the other week.

49:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
At its most generic level, it's multiple agents working together to run workshops.

49:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
And for JP to encode his level of expertise in what a good workshop outcome is, There's a level of things that have to be done through code, though.

50:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And if we want to bring it to an admin through an interface, how do we know what we need to bring to an admin in the interface if we've never built a workshop, if we've never had the agents run a workshop? For example, we might not foresee that one of the agents need one of the agents needs access to tools. If we didn't know that when we were building the workshop builder, then we'd have to replan a lot of things. I think just moving forward, how we discussed is build one workshop, as hard-coded as we want, of course, still giving JP the ability to control the the high level behavior, and then well, no, not the high level, actually, the more concise behavior. And then after there, we'll know what a workshop is, how should a workshop go? What are the aspects that we want to give to the website? What do we want in the website in the workshop builder?

51:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Because right now we could piece together, as of right now, we can say, yeah, we should have this and that within the workshop builder. But there's going to be, I'm quite sure there's going to be a lot of things that we can't foresee until we build one.

51:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think then we have to do the first one. And that is the outcome that we're after, we learn through that one. I think trying to speculate it up forward is not feasible, not pragmatic, because once JP starts training the bot, he might go, I need to be able to do X with this. And that might be a feature as opposed to just a prompt.

52:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so I think there's going to be that sort of iterative way. So I suppose back into the question, given what we have in ADAPT today, would now be the right time to fork? And start working on IA or do you feel that we need to do some more things in ADAPT that IA will also benefit from and it is more sensible as a point to deviate?

52:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Jonas, what do you think?

52:37 - Eksno 
That's definitely something I'd like to discuss further with you going over the codes and just diving into it after the meeting. One thing that I like, as you mentioned, the onboarding process will be quite useful within JPE's application along with the high-level graph being able to lift that over, even if it's not a necessary thing. It's a thing that we're going to be making for that, that we also know we're going to be making for IntelliAgent Onboarding, I think for the first version, is completely irrelevant for the IntelliAgent.

53:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not necessary, because we can just, like you've hardcoded in the bot at the moment, which assumes it's the evening, we'll assume we're working at an established company, for example. So onboarding is. Just the chat, we can delete it, and we can start again. Or we just spin up a new instance. Like you have a Kuhn Jonas window or instance, we would just have client one, client two, client three. There is no need to onboard it. I think we just want to start.

53:41 - Eksno 
Do you want to do the same thing for Adapta, where every user just has a predefined variables for everything that's supposed to be in the onboarding?

53:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry, I don't understand.

53:54 - Eksno 
That also has an onboarding process with all the things that you sent in the Google Docs earlier, where a lot of them are marked onboarding. We were planning to implement that onboarding phase along with the high-level graph. But what we also can do is just for every profile we create, predefine all those variables and don't implement the onboarding phase yet. Then we can focus on the chatting interface.

54:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I don't think we need to prioritize the, I mean, onboarding is just the population of those things, right?

54:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
We don't, there's nothing that innovative there. Let's focus on the coaching and that engagement because that's the, onboarding is a nice to have. I don't think it's a priority to work on right now.

54:42 - Eksno 
I think the most relevant part that we're currently working on, which will be relevant to IntelliAgent, will be the high-level graph. So the graph that delegates status of what's going on to a specific team.

54:59 - Eksno 
So for example, if the user wants to start a check-in, the status will be set to check-in, and each message will be delegated to the check-in team. I imagine there's going to be a similar system that will be needed for IntelliAgent.

55:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Say that again.

55:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
It didn't quite land.

55:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is my mic bad?

55:29 - Eksno 
It's been the energy.

55:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I don't, I don't agree. I don't think so. The intelligence, the, the high level modules is just the workshop where the onboarding is, we're going to get, we're not going to do yet. We're just going to do the workshop where there's just the agents having a conversation with the user, um, trying to come to a final conclusion with the brand purposes through different techniques, like AB testing with different, uh, ideas, um, the card game.

56:02 - Eksno 
All that card game, the A-B testing, all of those I imagine could be different graphs. We might want those to be different graphs, and then it would be useful with the high-level or the, what was it? High-level graph implementation from that.

56:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but I mean, that's nothing too new, too big. It's just kind of normal line graph.

56:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I can't remember, where did we go from I think we've gone off track here.

56:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
We're trying to establish how much more coding we need to do and adapt before it makes sense to fork into IntelliAgent and start doing the specific elements for IntelliAgent. Onboarding is not needed to answer that question.

56:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like, like Jonah said, give us a day or two to go into the code, or the code and the kind of the plan for the future plan for ADAPT, what our, our plan looks like in development, and then we can get back on a better answer.

57:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, I'm, I, I want to be involved in that conversation around ADAPT because There's now that we have something like you guys are saying, yeah, we're going to do onboarding and stuff like that. I think we need to have those conversations and get aligned on what the next sensible thing is, because for example, we've been testing it. And then I was like going, shit, actually, I think we need to ask for sleep in the morning. Because like, there's two scenarios, right? Someone voluntarily gives the information, others were seeking the information. But when you wake up in the morning, you should say, hey, here's your video. Here's some content. Go smash the day. By the way, how was your sleep last night? That makes more sense, where if we haven't seen something towards the end of the day, it's more of a coaching session about, how have you felt? You're two weeks into the program. How's that going for you? And by the way, I noticed on Tuesdays that you don't really enter information. What can we do to help you on that? Or it's not just you haven't filled in sleep. You haven't just filled in your calories. That's a very small size of it. And I think I want to work on the coaching and start getting that, because that's going to be the most nuanced area that's going to require the most testing. We've now got a nice, what feels stable. It's not breaking, albeit it was breaking for JP.

58:29 - Jorge Lewis 
It seems like there's some bug, one bug that keeps appearing.

58:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

58:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's where I would work on. And for me, what's nice is, if possible, where, for example, like saying, you're asking the wrong questions for sleep. Go fix that.

58:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

58:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
The sort of chasing the problems right now might be a useful activity. Maybe it's me and Jonas or me and the other guys working on the web or the interface stuff. But as soon as you talk about the interface, I need to talk to you guys because we need to figure out what that looks like, I don't know whether we're going to have a hybrid interface or not. So I've got lots of questions, but I think you need to involve me in that whole process because, and JP as well, because we're quite opinionated about what this could be. I'm not opinionated because we're being dicks. I just think we've been thinking about this day in, day out for a long time. So I think it's potentially dangerous and harmful for you guys to go off in isolation and decide these things without speaking to us.

59:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that makes sense. I agree.

59:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so, so we can move forward to set up a time to, to call with, I want to get chimney on as well. The, uh, or other line chain AI developer. Uh, we can go through kind of the next few steps. Then also, if things have changed in terms of long-term for adapt, we can take a look at that as well. Um, and then directly after that would be able to say, okay, so now that we know how things are looking for that, we will be able to decide at what point is most efficient to begin Intelli agent.

1:00:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:00:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when do you want to do that?

1:00:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm traveling tomorrow. Um, so let's, well, tomorrow's the weekend.

1:00:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, I mean, I'm traveling on Tuesday.

1:00:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, let's, um, can I, can I get back to you on that? My schedule's looking really busy the next week. I don't have to be there as well. I'm travelling all day Monday.

1:00:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Myself and Aaron are going up to a meeting.

1:00:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Tuesday is pretty busy.

1:00:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I don't want to wait till Wednesday because I don't know what you guys are doing. So for me, I think even half an hour now, I think it's just a very quick meeting.

1:01:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's try to get it in as soon as possible. At least at least something as quick as possible, and then we can try to schedule a longer, more thorough one.

1:01:12 - Eksno 
Jorge, do you think you'll be waiting at the airport at all? Maybe we can do a meeting then?

1:01:17 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll definitely have some downtime somewhere, but I can't say, oh, I'll have downtime here because Can we do 20 minutes now?

1:01:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think he's on.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (29).txt"

Tue, Aug 27, 2024

0:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
for a long time. And he's got some different points of view on stuff. So I just thought it'd be really useful if the three of us could have a quick chat.

0:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Morning.

0:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Morning.

0:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
The latest issue.

0:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
You haven't pushed any fixes or anything from last night, no?

0:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
I just pushed or OK, I just committed one, but I haven't pushed it.

0:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I haven't.

0:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK.

0:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
I was about to test one, but I was getting like a 504 deployment error and just resending the message work. So I'm about to push a change that basically just retries seven times if there were message errors to try to just at least temporarily get around those.

0:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

0:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Go ahead.

0:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you can see here where it says So step three is the playback, which is correct. This one here.

1:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then it just randomly decides as part of playback to saying, would you like to discuss some initial steps to get started? I then ask the question, what do you mean, get started doing what? And it's jumped to phase four.

1:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I know you've said that the LLMs can just give you erratic behavior. But we can't really have a product that's that erotic. So I think JP feels that there's, use the best word ever, there's some standard lubrication that needs to take place between one message to another message and across steps that's not happening. But yeah, it'd be good to get your thoughts on what you think is happening here.

1:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, to start off with, at risk of repeating myself, I think this is, once again, something that will definitely be improved a lot when we get the review system in, because the playback messages, it'll have many examples of how they should look, and it should consistently answer in that way. But that also applies to all the other steps.

2:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, I think that's fine for the tone and stuff like that. But this one here, would you like to discuss some initial steps to get started? Has no place being part of three.

2:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like if you look- Yeah, so in the reviews, if all the examples that gets in the reviews don't include a question, then it won't include a question when it's creating its own answer.

2:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, okay, fine. So if I, is the deleting of these working yet?

2:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, just click one from the bottom on up. I'm not sure if the steps going backwards is working yet. I have to fix up on that. I've been in call with Jorge a lot of this morning, just discussing how to move forward.

2:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I want to reset that, do I just go again?

3:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, it's still in step four.

3:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

3:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I suppose there's not much to talk about then until either the steps is added or we have the review thing.

3:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

3:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, is Jorge available now? We can have the 9 o'clock now.

3:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
he's online on discord but offline on gather and gather is kind of the platform where we join when we're actually on he hasn't answered me either asked if he was off and guessing he's up for lunch or something that's around the time OK. But otherwise, everyone else seems to be on. So whenever Jorge comes back, I think we can do a meeting with everyone or a meeting with just us two or us three and Jorge discussing how to move forward with projects overall.

4:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, let's have that one first. What's your thoughts on why the team are not sort of listening to you guys? Because like, no offense, you're the boss. They sort of have to do what you say.

4:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Could you, in what way, like not listening on the communication?

4:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, Jorge sort of asked for me to see if I could help inform the team as to why the importance of communicating to clients is important. I'm happy to help, by the way. It's not an issue. It's just I'm curious why they're not listening to you guys. And if there's any risk to me being involved, then it undermines your position.

4:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
What me and Jorge talked about is probably the fact that they don't feel the same kind of pressure that we do. Me and Jorge are just directly responsible for the projects and therefore want to make sure that everything is aligned all the time. For them, there's less pressure because it's usually us talking to you guys.

5:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not sure if I'd agree with that. I think that pressure that you're feeling is what's called ethics and morals. Um, I don't know what, I think you'd feel that pressure to a degree, whether we were speaking to you or not, this is your company, your dream, your vision. And, um, regardless, you're never going to have employees give the same amount of shit as you and Jorge. It's just never going to happen. It doesn't happen ever. Um, There's a difference between giving a shit and being professional. And I would imagine that there's an issue here where, um, in the cultures where the engineers are, the thought of being vulnerable is not acceptable. And what I mean by be vulnerable is asking. Potentially stupid questions or perceived to be stupid questions, showing incomplete work.

6:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
All that could cause them to get in trouble and lose their job in other environments where actually it's exactly the behavior that we're looking for here is because Little and often, and JP, I hope you don't mind, we've had that same, even conversations between me and you, where you'll create something and spend a huge amount of time. And then me or Arif might look at it and go, but what about this? You're like, oh, that's changed everything else. And it's just a style. There's also a style. So some people prefer to go away and do more work. Some people prefer to do little amounts and get feedback. There's also a cultural thing here and a style thing here. But yesterday, I asked the question, is there anybody working? And Jorge was like, yeah, three people are on holidays. We didn't know that. And then three people are working. And I'm like, I still wouldn't know that. One of the things that they need to understand is, as a remote company, you have a duty to fill the gap of remoteness. That's the trade-off, right? Either we all get in a room together, and we feel that sort of passive communication or you have to communicate in a way that there is passive awareness that people are actually working. Yeah. And it's not a spying thing. It's not like a big brother. I don't trust what you're doing and I need to micromanage you. It's not that at all. It's actually, as JP said the other day, we're, we're, we're really fucking excited about this and we want to be involved and, You know, this workshop builder in particular has huge potential for us. It's not there yet, but the more calls that I'm having with you, I feel you're getting closer to what we want. I can see you suddenly go, Oh, I need to do this instead. And that's that level of partnership that we're looking for. And to a point that should be on everything. Now, the reality is that some of your engineers are quite junior and there's some challenges with the literal translation of English. Like the LMS that I created, I think it's pretty straightforward. Like I feel it is. Let me see if I can show you what I'm talking about here. Here we go, LMS.

8:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is what I asked you. I shared with you yesterday, JP, but I sent you something too small. You couldn't read it.

9:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
So here, I have daily content as a type. If there can be a quote, which is just basically text. Actually, that should be text.

9:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that should be a daily quote. These are examples. So I don't have arrows here. The video, morning message, bottom line, meditation, and Will goes, What's a morning message bottom line in meditation? I'm like, it's just a video. For me, it's fairly obvious that it's just a video, but good on them for seeking clarity. So I've tried to be quite clear with these features.

9:46 - Jonathan Phillips 
Have you given them any context besides this?

9:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
In the overarching program, yes, but that's a long time ago and I actually don't recall who was in those sessions, if it was just Jorge or if it was even Jorge and Jonas.

10:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm a little confused though myself, which is normal.

10:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
Just where does this, so when you say LMS, where does this hang? Where does this exist?

10:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is a, LMS is probably too grandiose a term. This is a rudimentary content management system that will be, the LMS, whatever this thing is, allows us one, to set up a program that has a duration, eight weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, which has got something called a theme, which is topics and events or a live session. And each theme of a week has daily content. And all you're doing is you have a number of different content types that get drip fed out onto the platform on a daily basis that people have to consume. Now, the LMS is not tracking consumption of that. The agents and the systems are tracking that. So the LMS, the true, true, like if you looked at another white labeling LMS, a lot of the features we of a pure LMS are actually existing outside the LMS content management system. So this is probably, I think it's probably inappropriate. I think you've highlighted something. I don't think it needs to be called an LMS. I think it's more a CMS.

11:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. That makes more sense because there's no sort of overriding physical structure to it.

11:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. It's probably a course management system rather than a content management system. Yeah. I think that would probably make more sense, because some of the other bells and whistles sit in the agents and what the agents are doing with the data, like milestone tracking and streaks and all that sort of stuff. That's there, but not this. This is just the content aspect.

11:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think then Will created something down here.

12:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
And daily theme types is like, no, that doesn't make sense. So that just tells me that sentence, daily theme types, does not make sense. So that's probably an English not being a native English speaker issue.

12:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, this looks like types of medium, like if it's text, video, audio, documents. Exactly.

12:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the themes is sort of the, you know, There's a, there's an eight week program. The objective is this. So the program has to be described also because then the agents are going to be using this program as content for understanding. Like if someone says, Hey, this is what's coming up next week. The agent needs to be able to go in and look at the program and understand where it is. A weekly theme might be the week one is all about habit formation. So the quotes and all the content is going to be around habits.

13:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

13:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so the theme is a is a construct rather than a group of content. That's why there's some little issues there. So I mean, good that he's taken on. There isn't a user program, user weekly.

13:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I don't know. This needs to be looked at. I'm not entirely sure this is correct.

13:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
Can I just bounce quickly back to the workshop builder? Sure. I mentioned yesterday about training the bots with their expertise. How do we see that happening? The system at the moment is a structure of prompts and direction.

13:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
But where do we start to give them their expertise and how do we build that into the system?

13:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Part of the refinement will be using the review system, giving them their expertise. We'll likely be giving them tools like RAG to be able to look for documents that you guys give them. So that will be extensions of the workshop builder.

14:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
But Jonas, yesterday when we spoke about this with Jorge, Jorge said we shouldn't be using RAG for that.

14:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
For which part was it?

14:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like, for example, we wanted to say, this is what ADAPT is, and give a reference document of saying, when we talk about ADAPT, this is actually what we mean. And he goes, we shouldn't be using RAG for that. It's not effective.

14:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah. I think there will be one large document about what ADAPT is, where it can look up more specific information. But the general information about what ADAPT is that it should always know should be in the project.

14:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
So let's just say my naive understanding of say let's take it back a step so imagine that the bot was an actual person it was a an employee of a business so the business recruits the bot and says hey come and work for our organization and within our organization, we do things this way. This is what we do. This is a new system you've got to learn. These are your colleagues that you're working with. And this is the process and the guidelines working with all your colleagues. That's what I kind of see the system at the moment. An employee comes in, and then all the guidelines and process of how they work within the organization is what they have. But the moment we don't have what's in the brain of the employee coming in, all the tacit knowledge, the information that that employee has over all the others and the reason he's being employed. So he has specific knowledge relating to his core purpose and his expertise. And at the moment, we don't seem to have that wrapped into the system.

15:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
The reason it's not there yet is because this is a POC of the Workshop Builder. But we're going to be expanding our component with features, of course, as they are needed and we get the capability to create them. This was a proof of concept to get a Workshop Builder in your hands so that you guys can see if you wanted to move onwards with this workshop builder?

16:18 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah of course, it's not a criticism obviously. I mean I'm just coming in saying sort of like bulldozing in and saying you know this is my perception of the world. I mean to give an example when I did one of the workshops that I put together yesterday before it broke. It came to me with a definition of brand and that definition isn't the modern definition of brand. It's a definition that 90% of the world use still but it's very traditional and old-fashioned. So where is it getting that information from and I want to make sure that the bot who's talking about brand knows the current modern definition. So That's not something I want to build into a prompt because there's so many elements that I want to make sure it's expert on, it would just be silly. But I could feed it documents that basically give it its personality as far as an employee and as far as an expert. And that's sort of the element that I see missing at the moment.

17:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think throughout building this workshop builder we'll kind of learn which technologies and which techniques work best like all together. I can of course give examples of what systems we could use to do that. We could build up a knowledge graph that's kind of There's a lot of technologies we can use to achieve it. I don't know which are best yet. I don't suggest that we'll have all the answers straight away.

17:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
is that the way that this is going to differentiate itself between a hundred other software developer companies out there who are doing exactly what we're doing. Let's not forget that there's thousands of companies doing similar things. The differentiation we have is the training, is the tweaking, the fine-tuning, the training. So as far as systems go, people will be migrating towards using the same frameworks and the same ideas. And yes, we can do something funky and something different and have some differentiation with the technology. But ultimately, it's the way we get the expertise into the bots and also the way they behave with each other, of course. And that fine-tuning and that understanding to make them more human, I think, is the race. The race is to get these bots becoming human. And if we can do that, that becomes powerful. So that's why I get excited. So I want to train them, I want to make them different, I want them to react differently to the way that I, so when I do simulations in the ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini environment, I want to see a difference in what we're doing because the bots are experts, whereas They're very generic, and they can pretend they're experts in my simulations, but they aren't. They're just obviously simulating. So it's that expertise that I think is our differentiator. And obviously, if we then do this in different industry verticals and different categories, it's the expertise that is the differentiator, not the platform itself. But without the platform, we don't have anything. So the platform is so essential and key. And how we get that right is imperative. But the beauty is in then what we do with it.

19:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I can give you kind of my high level understanding of like how the technologies fit in and method to like how a human works. I'd say that like the RAG or the graph RAG or there's new technologies for implementing it every day, whatever RAG system it is, it's kind of like your long-term memory. It's what's stored way in the back of your head, and you don't have it on the top of your mind all the time. But when you hear a keyword like brand purpose, then all that information about brand purpose pops back into your head. That's kind of how Wrike works, where you can have very specialized and the high level and like the understandings which are not always present in the top of its head. Then there's knowledge graphs, which is its understandings of how things connect to other things, how, for example, a network as a platform could be a knowledge graph, which is always at the top of your head. So that could be like a 10 minute or 15 minute preparation before you're running a workshop. You're building up your own knowledge graph of what you're going to be running. Then there's the prompt, of course, those are instructions also always in their heads. I don't really know how to map a prompt to a human brain as an analogy, but I think you both know how a prompt works.

20:59 - Jonathan Phillips 
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. That's aware and then you've got to basically bring in a separate sort of conscious memory and you react that way and that's what I'm sort of looking forward to marrying those two up. The process, the base prompts, this is what we need to out of this exercise but then it's like all the clever stuff and the experience over the years of the bot obviously it won't have years of experience but we're emulating a human and how they're bringing all their years and years and years of different jobs different um education systems everything back into the present to actually do something special so so let's just dream for a moment and so

22:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
We've got the core capability now to have sequential steps.

22:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
We know we need to be able to add in steps at different points because we were refining a message or refining prompts. So we need to be able to alter steps. When we're testing, we know we need to be able to delete steps and go back rather than having to retest everything, because it gets exponentially longer to do anything. In order to get where you just said, JP, what other high level functions do we think this builder needs before we could get to a v1 like what's the actual gun against the head minimum feature set because from my point of view from a your why workshop single agent just facilitator and subvisor not multi-participants like for from the point of view of adapt single agent is fine and I'm thinking you know if I get the review capability I probably feel I could go live with that But that's a very simplistic workshop. That's not a workshop. That's a coaching session. A workshop is a multi-complex thing. You've talked about branching and more complex routing of the steps rather than just a flow.

23:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
That was a question, guys. More to you, JP, to say what do you think we need?

23:40 - Jonathan Phillips 
All right, sorry.

23:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
So I'm looking at it from a human perspective. So I'm imagining humans in a room. So they're the bots. And it's how we bring in the whole human element. So you've got your individual experts, you've got your processes. So at the moment we've got a system that takes you through a process. And at the moment it's quite linear. So you start at the beginning and you finish at the end and there's no deviation really. You are driven down a line, a single line. But in life it's not like that. So if you have people in a room discussing during a meeting, just like we are now, this conversation is going all over the place. It's everything but linear. Even though we still have an objective in the meeting and we're still talking about one subject, it's all over the place.

24:57 - Jonathan Phillips 
Without the ability to go all over the place, you don't get the expertise of everybody involved, because you are being driven down a single route. So you may have people in the room who aren't involved in the conversation, for whatever reason, who could add lots of expertise in, so the end result is much more profitable for the meeting. So, the way I see it, it can't be linear, it has to be looping back sometimes, because you're going down the wrong alleyway, you are basically discussing something and you've missed the point or you are being driven the wrong way and it might take someone else to bring you back there and then you loop round to maybe two steps before and go right, okay, let's get back on track. Let's go now back to the right route. So I see constant loops.

25:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So JP, I just want to, I agree with you by the way, I just want to bring that to life for JP, for Jonas for a second. Jonas, can you see this?

25:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can see it.

25:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is what's called a business model canvas. It's pretty cool, but it was very, very popular for a while.

26:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, way back in the day.

26:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Now I run this for workshops. I've run this for clients and it's a very useful structure, right? How you engage this document is completely organic. Now I have my own personal technique. I will start with a bit of the value proposition. I will then jump to the customer segments. The customer segments might inform more value propositions. We might pause for a while and understand what's the best channel to deliver that value proposition to those customer segments. Once that goes, get a few of those, what sort of relationship do you want with those customers on those channels to deliver those value propositions? So these four boxes iterates quite a lot. Now, at some point, that starts to stabilize. It's sort of a good feeling, like I'm now fucking flogging a dead horse. I'm not getting, you know, at the start, there's loads of new ideas. Then suddenly it dries up a little bit. So I move on. And then I could possibly talk to about revenue. And then I would possibly talk to about key partners, activities and resources in order to drive out what the cost structure is. That's just how I do it. Might do it differently. My friend Ciarán who's running these last week will do it differently. But it's not, it's not consistent. The path, one, by doing customer segments, I give us an idea in value proposition. And I think this is the backwards and forwards and how ones, you could easily do, what's this? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. You could easily make a nine step workshop, assuming you do this, then you finish value propositions, then you do customer. It's not like that. There are nine discrete, I don't want to call them steps, there are, minus steps. As JP said, it's a process. I go from A to B to C to D. And that's fine. Certain workshops work like that. It's totally fine. There are others where there are, these are nine components. There's nine components to the workshop. I will dabble in one of them, go to another one. The second one might inform something more on the first one. So you dance around, for example, you will dance around all of these until you feel that they're complete.

28:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so something we'd be looking to them is, instead of having the telling the facilitator when to go to the next step, we'd provide the facilitator with the capability to go to any step and then in the prompt of the facilitator, describe the steps and somehow tell it more dynamically how it can switch between them.

28:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just want to check with JP, does this sort of metaphor explanation here of a workshop work for your world as well?

28:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
It does, it does. It's the organicness and again that's what I got excited originally when I started reading about multi-agent models. It's the the change, the switch over from having a chatbot where you have prescribed answers. And that's what we don't want to have. We want to have the opposite to that. We want to have a process that technically is a straight line, but every time you have the conversation or the workshop, it's a different straight line.

29:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I was demoing Super Whisper yesterday, and there was a demo video on YouTube of this psychologist who uses it.

29:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
He's been using Dragon Dictate for years, and he now uses Super Whisper. It's made it more efficient. And one of the things he can do is he will use all sorts of acronyms, like PQ cell basically means participant or patient takes it in the morning and the evening. What the fuck does that mean? The letters aren't even any way related. But it's obviously medical shorthand. And so what he did was he goes, it will do a literal translation for me. But then what I did was I gave it an example of my shorthand verbal note and how I would have transcribed it verbatim. And as soon as I did that, it's flawless. It's absolutely amazing, because it's not taking my example literally. It's literally taking it as an example. What I'm finding at the moment when I write in to the prompt, here is an example. Do not use this exactly. Just use it as a reference. It uses it exactly. And we're missing something at the moment in the ability to give it examples and for it to be inspired by the example as opposed to taking it literally. Super Whisper has figured it. So it is possible. Now, one question I have for you, JP, if I was doing this Business Model Canvas workshop, I would think it could get overwhelmed with these nine things. Like, where the fuck do I go next? Like, who knows? You can go to any of them, by the way. But you can get yourself in an infinite model very quickly. So having done this, I would have a suggested path. And suggested does not always have to be followed. But it's a recommendation to go value proposition, customer segments.

31:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
There's nothing wrong with having a default or several defaults to go to when there's nothing more obvious, so to speak. There is a path to be taken. So, for example, if you're doing a workshop in a room with people and everyone's really quiet, the facilitator will just go through the steps without any modification because whatever's in his head isn't being interrupted. So it's only the interruptions and this applies to obviously the bot system. So if an analyst bot comes in and starts to say hang on a minute, new information coming in, breaking news, things change. You're not going to then go, oh, that's really interesting, and then carry on what you were doing. It's changed the whole dimension, maybe, of the conversation. And then you look back and say, right, OK, in that case, let's redo the last bit because it doesn't make sense anymore, or it's really old-fashioned, whatever. But ultimately, it's a dynamic situation where you're analyzing all the time the steps to see are you in the best position? Are you bringing in the right resource? Are you in the right place in the conversation?

32:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you have to have an agent sort of being the guardian for each box on this page and basically saying, am I good enough? Have you come up with something else that I think you now need to change in my area?

32:39 - Jonathan Phillips 
And that's where expertise comes in, because you're relying the expertise of each segment, each area, being the authority.

32:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
I like the idea of segments. I think a workshop should have segments, because the segment has no implication of sequence or anything. And a segment then will need to have an agent expert for each one. And then you have a facilitator for the workshop that guides you through segments. Now, there might be a starting segment or a suggested one, And there'll be an intro workshop, which is probably a sequential process to say, what's your company? There's probably a little bit of a set of context. And then you're going into the segments. And the segments are who knows what order you're going to take.

33:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Right.

33:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, Jorge.

33:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, everyone.

33:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
So we're finished, you're doing everything.

33:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, when's the deadline?

33:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes.

33:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
You've got a very fancy outside your room there, looking very lush and garden, lots of trees.

34:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's the point. It doesn't look that good in person.

34:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
What do we want to do here?

34:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
So where are we? In short, the Workshop Builder is tantalizingly good, but not useful yet. It's still got some glass ceilings that we're knocking our heads against. I think we've got a good, sort of relationship with Jonas. I think Jonas is getting into our heads more in terms of where we need to go with this. I'm getting to the point where I think Jonas can even start thinking about things that we might need that we haven't asked for, because he understands, because we're having these sort of good conversations around where it's going. I see the journey being, let's get a very basic process-based workshop working, which is where we're getting close to now. Then there is a multi-agent version of that. And then this new version, which is what we're calling segments, where you've got segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but there is no sequence to them. And you have to have agents associated with that. I'm implying that, but I don't know if that's the right roadmap, by the way. There might be differences.

35:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
There is no ADAPT product or go-to-market without this. There just isn't, like there's no point in going to market without this working really well because this is the differentiator. Same for IntelliAgent, by the way.

35:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So one of the things I was talking to Jonas last night with, I'm not, you know, as I'm not really interested in the LMS and the mobile and blah, blah, until this works. Once this works, then that's going to be super important. But without having all that other stuff making progress doesn't really make sense. So one of the features that we need from Adapt, which is the reviewer, the review capability, we need to bring that into the Workshop Builder or Workshop Builder migrates over to Adapt and it's all one platform for now. And we'd figure it out later. Let's talk about what the right approach is. So the question I'd have is, is can we migrate or can we move some of the team onto the Workshop Builder and getting this moving forward faster or concurrently? Integrating the reviewer, for example, from Adapt into the workshop builder hopefully wouldn't need to take up Jonas's time. Wouldn't make sense, but it's one of the other engineers should be able to do that. Is there other features that we could get going on? Like, is there somebody I can work on other than Jonas to debug it, or is it better to work with Jonas on the debugging and the fast iteration? All those questions.

36:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is where I think we need to double down on the investment and the time, because without it, I don't think we have a product.

37:01 - Jorge Lewis 
And how does that play in with IntelliAgent? Is it all the same for IntelliAgent?

37:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, IntelliAgent and ADAPT, with the Workshop Builder, almost become one of the same thing.

37:16 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, ultimately, the Workshop Builder is the foundation for everything we do. So ultimately, without that, we don't have it, and it can be generic enough to plug into everything. But I think that's the core that we need to make, we need to get right.

37:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
The marketing element really just is a wrapper that goes on top. I mean, ultimately it's that 80% engine.

37:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Remember what we, what I think the proof of concept has proven is that if you build us the capability We decoupled, you've decoupled us from, we are decoupled from you from imparting expertise.

38:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, obviously there's some handshaking going on in terms of which bits are prompts and we need reviews because it's still quite early, right? But the point is that once this gets to a V1, if JP makes 50 workshops over the next four months, has no bearing on you guys, unless there's a new feature request. And I think that's the great, that's the really powerful unlock. It means I can go and refine this coach to become a coach the way I wanted to coach.

38:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's where I think it's going to be different. All those, myself and JP were talking about this yesterday, like there's a lot of apps out there that functionally do the same thing, like to-do app or a backlog tool. Some of them are just, they're just better. And a lot of it comes down to these micro interactions where you can't really sort of see them, but together it all just goes, yeah, they're sort of the same, but that's just better. And that's what this is allowing us to do. Not yet, but that's what we want it to do.

39:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
And when we say better, my perspective of better is the output. So imagine that there were four concurrent systems trying to build a marketing strategy, let's say, and all of them have output. And you could do it now with ChatGPT. You could simulate it now, and it will come out with an output, a strategy. But if you lined up all the strategies, the one we want for our system is going to be superior. And when everybody lines them up, they go, wow, all the others are very samey and generic-y and just like, okay, but it's not going to set the world on fire. Whereas that one there, wow. That's what I want to see. I want to see the output so different. And almost like you have Office Juniors doing the rest, and then you have a 30-year veteran, 40-year veteran, doing the fourth one. And it's just so different. It's out of this world. So that's my impression of the output that I would like,

40:10 - Jonathan Phillips 
So go and do it. There we go. That's it. That's the brief.

40:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Easy peasy.

40:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Easy peasy. Yeah, what are you thinking, Jorge? I think I've been run down on that already, kind of by Kieran yesterday. So I'd like your input.

40:34 - Jorge Lewis 
On what specifically?

40:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, let me make this very sort of simple. So, one, Can we move...

40:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
We need to create a new backlog, an enhanced backlog for Workshop Builder. Let's do that in a moment. Two, are you okay with moving some team members over onto the Workshop Builder team to make this faster, better, et cetera, based to deliver that new backlog?

41:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Jonathan and I said we'd probably have Has9 move over.

41:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, if there's others as well, that'd be useful, but fine. Three, the budget. We will fund at least another, let's do this in two-week chunks. We'll fund another two weeks. So if that's Jonas and Hussain for two weeks, that's another $4,000.

41:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Math is pretty hard. I think it's a little bit less because...

41:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think it's Because they're half a joke.

42:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Whatever it is, we'll approve another two weeks. So if we're broadly agreed that that's what you need from us, then I think we need to agree what the backlog is and what we think is feasible in that two weeks, like we did for the first two weeks.

42:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. And Jonas, is there somebody else? I mean, obviously, you know the system because you built it. Who would be best placed to do the debugging with us? Is that the best use of your time? Or are you better off doing more complex features?

42:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think I'm probably best off, at least when there's a new thing coming in, outlining the framework of how it's put in so that it's properly integrated. And then they can probably help debug it. But it really depends on what we're debugging. If it's more a core issue, then probably me. But if it's just a surface-level thing that needs to be fixed quickly, I think any developer that has an in could do that.

43:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
So as you mentioned, you don't think I need to be on implementing reviews, but I think it would be good for me to implement the reviews, because the fundamental structure behind the reviews have to be quite tightly integrated with how the agents are built up, how it's passed into them, how all behind that works. I'd like to get the structure of it right before I don't think we've finished the foundational work, have we?

43:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
The foundation hasn't been laid yet. We're not even building up yet. We're still working out exactly what the core is.

43:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so I'm just going to create...

43:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Something I imagined getting his name on moving, or for this next week, like moving forward, is refining the advanced stuff thing, because quite right now I've just laid out all the foundation, just thrown bricks at the floor, and I've got a foundation, but it's not really refined. The bricks aren't in their proper places yet, but he could make sure the bricks for the advanced step is more refined, because the structure is already there. He just needs to refine how it works, that it's able to do all those edge cases that we've gone over where you've had issues and all that. And also, We'll probably, as you mentioned, need to convert the step system into a segment system instead and provide the...

44:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
We should do now or later.

44:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I imagine that comes more down to if it's essential to JP's UBP workshop that he'll be experimenting with creating...

45:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think we've got to work on some fundamentals. We can't go off in several directions. We've got to work out what we want and what is going to be the core going forward for everything. So I think we need to work that out first rather than develop two branches and then throw one away.

45:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
For me, right now, being able to test this effectively makes a lot of sense.

45:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
If we can't test it, we can't disappoint building it. So I think deleting messages and taking a back step so I don't have to go through whether they're steps or segments is a really big win.

45:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
This sort of thing is irrelevant to our core direction as far as segments or linear or whatever, because this is relevant to whatever we do.

45:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Deleting the message and backing the step is relevant to it.

45:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. So that's a micro thing, isn't it? That we need anyway, whatever direction we go in, that is essential.

46:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So what I'm trying to do here is actually just build a list of stuff that we need to build, and then we'll agree the order and the sequence. So we need the review capability. Migration so that's bringing over the review capability from adapt into this and there's an improvement. And again, you, there are going to be some workshops that are step to step and other workshops that are are not So we need to improve the current capability for moving from a step to a step. It's a bit crunchy at the moment. And I'm just trying to think from my world, purely from the why workshop, if I get these things and they're working really well, I think the why workshop is... I'm trying to think of all the other issues that we had. The review is a massive unlock.

46:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
The deleting the steps allows me to test faster. So the other thing then I would say is speed.

47:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
There were times yesterday we're waiting 20, 30 seconds almost in certain cases for a response. When we're trying to do testing and iterate on it, it's really, really slow. It's quite painful. Maybe there's something we can do about that because it's all to do with the OpenAI and actually our server is fast, it's just waiting on the delay or is it our server that's slow?

47:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think that one also comes down into the, I don't know if you watched it, but Jorge sent a video about premature optimizations earlier. And I think this is probably something that should be tackled towards the end once all the foundational elements are in place, because it's going to be so particular to the solution. And also it's such an arbitrary, there's no clear way to go forward with it, if that makes sense.

47:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, why is it 30 seconds though?

47:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not 30 seconds for me. It's not for me. Also, it wasn't 30 seconds yesterday night. So like for all I know, it may have been just a bad time of the day when all the batch jobs were being run in OpenAI or something.

48:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, because for me, it was fine.

48:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:19 - Jonathan Phillips 
I was getting 10 to 15 seconds.

48:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. So the response times increased with the amount of agents. That's one thing.

48:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because it's all the agents having to, that are answering, and then the subvisor is taking all the answers into account, selecting one and passing it onward. All the agents are responding in unison, though. They're responding at the same time, and then being passed to the supervisor. But of course, that means the time it takes to reply is the time it takes for the longest replying agent to reply.

48:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I watched that video, and in principle, I agree with it.

48:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just to give you a summary, I don't know whether you watched it. It basically is, don't over-engineer performance when you've zero customers. Which sort of makes, I get it. Now, the only issue I'd say is that years ago, myself and Arif, when we were building a rudimentary agile project manager on our own backlog management tool, we made a technology choice under direction to use Angular rather than React.

49:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it worked fine. It worked really well. It was fast. It looked smooth. And then suddenly, when we started having a lot of deep backlogs, I think the Angular has, I forgot what they're called, but like handles. And it basically was, the way Angular worked, there was something like 50,000 bits of memory being used for want of a better word, and React had a much better way. So we're six months in, and we end up having to rebuild. We just basically said, Angular can't do what we need to do. We had to move to React. That was a massive two-month, huge cost migration. So there's, yes, I get the concept of premature optimization, But don't start building a train when what you need is a boat.

50:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
You can't be belligerent on the optimization either. So the speed of response, yes, everything you said makes total sense. But if we've fundamentally chosen some bad technology and we get this, and suddenly JP has a fourth agent and a 12th segment, and the entire architecture just goes, eh, eh, that's going to be a problem. If it's just getting exponentially slower, but we know we can throw 10 others and a little bit of re-architecture, totally fine. But we can't just willy-nilly just stick shit together and then in six months go, oh, we've got to rebuild the entire thing.

51:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's a trade off, right? You can't just say, do whatever and we'll figure it out in the future. There's gotta be some awareness of the future needs.

51:18 - Jorge Lewis 
On the hand, on the other, I disagree with the part where you don't throw things willy nilly and fix it later because when you put things willy nilly, they allow you to move faster, which gives you a lot of ability to either get funding, get customers feedback, get money from customers testing at a smaller scale. And if you have to fix that, that problem that that willy nilly thing has made, it shows that that willy nilly thing had value.

51:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Potentially, but we couldn't, we couldn't go to market.

51:49 - Jorge Lewis 
If it's something that's preventing you from going for market, then it doesn't accomplish the task. It's not.

51:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but it worked.

51:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
It worked under a very small scope, but then as soon as we pushed it, I think ultimately it's trying to understand what the problem is, because if it's a problem of scaling, then fair enough, you can scale and as Cuan suggested, throw more power at it. But if there's a flaw in the architecture, which we don't know about and we ignore, then that flaw still exists when we try and build on top. So if we don't identify it, then it's always there. And it could be a problem, might not be, but it could be. So I think knowing what the problem is, even if we don't attempt to fix it is key.

52:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like in this example here, we'd be looking at, okay, realistically, what's the maximum number of agents we'd be looking at? And then we look around there and say, okay, architecturally, is that something that should change because we're using say a hundred agents compared to 10?

52:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
Exactly.

52:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah.

52:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, that's the experimentation I'd like to do. I'd like to know whether because we're pushing things here that there aren't necessarily, um, case studies for.

53:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, so we need to know ourselves, but I, I think we have to put some bounds on things. I think running a workshop, like when I'm running physical workshops with people, I wouldn't have a hundred people in there. I'd have maybe. Four voices max. Counting beyond that becomes overly confusing.

53:23 - Jonathan Phillips 
If, for example, rather than how you say voices, but if you imagine that every single person with a voice in there, the limited number had loads of people giving them information all the time, then they'd be able to analyze that information and hand it on.

53:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
But us architecting and building a system today that handles five agents versus a hundred agents is fundamentally different.

53:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't think we know where the level is though. I mean, they're extreme examples. We don't know whether 10 is optimum, 15 is optimum.

53:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Optimum, I think is a dangerous question. I would offer what's good enough to show something. And so if we could run a workshop with five agents, and let's say each of those agents has a maximum of one helper agent in the background. So you've got 10 agents concurrently are going. Now, knowing that Jonas has raised significant concerns around the cost of running these things and the speed of having so many agents, I get the ambition. But let's start with something. If we try to boil the ocean, we're not going to get anywhere.

54:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
No I understand and I'm not suggesting we make it but if we have a proof of concept that works perfectly with 5, 6, 7 agents but then it falls over at 10 and longer term 10 the goal or 15 is the goal then that could be an issue too.

54:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh you know it is but then that would be I would suggest a re-architecture because if you build day 1 to support 10 or 15 20 well that's, you know, that's a much bigger problem that might take us a year to build solutions for that, as opposed to we could get a five in two months.

55:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I agree. I agree. But what I don't want to do is build a system and then rebuild the whole system because it's flawed as far as scalability.

55:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I agree with I think there has to be we know that we are So Jorge missed the first part of the conversation. So today's version of the workshop is a sequential set of steps, one, two, three, four, and you go down. You're forced down a process. The next evolution of that we know we want to get to is each one of these steps becoming what's called a segment. And there may or may not be a defined order to go through those segments. We know that's ultimately where we have to get to. Having a singular path of 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 was useful for the proof of concept. It's probably sufficient for my Y workshop. It's not going to work for JP's workshops, because his are more fluid in terms of where they go. So today, we need to decide, is that an architectural pivot that we need to take today? I'm wondering whether it does. I think it sounds like it is. We know, ultimately, there's going to be a lot of agents. Agents cost money. So what is the first pass of this? Well, let's say four agents with a helper each. So up to 10 agents, let's say. You might look at that and go, you know what? We can give you five really easily. After that, it becomes really difficult. Well, we'll go with five. Let's see if we can get some customers. I think at five, we could still demo something. We could still wow people with it. And we then know that we have a real architectural diva to fix later to go to 10 or to go to 20. I don't know what the breaking point is. Maybe there is no breaking point, and it's purely money. I don't know. But I think we need to face into these incrementally rather than trying to imagine what they could all be, because I don't think we'll go fast.

57:11 - Jorge Lewis 
we can tackle the actual problem whether deciding that. But the quick note is for the costs, I don't think the cost will ever be a concern until you guys are trying to optimize for profit. They'll always, because at every point we're in, we're going to be able to optimize the costs. Up until a point where you're not really looking at anything but optimizing profit. Then you're gonna be looking at numbers and like, yeah, the percentage of profit and things like that.

57:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
To add on to that though, the cost is just multiplied by the amount of participants plus two. So we have the supervisor and facilitator. For every agent you add, it's going to be just multiplied by that number. It's not exponential, it's a linear how it goes up, but it's multiplied by that. So if you have 100 agents, that's going to cost, okay, 102 agents, that's going to cost 100 times more than workshop, no, or just a facilitator and a supervisor or a supervisor. But the theoretical speeds limitation of adding more agents is literally the longest response time. So the agent with the longest response time. So it should be a logarithmic curve more so than exponential or linear curve in terms of response time and capability of scaling to many, many agents. The problem is more if we add layers of agents, so agents that talk to agents that talk to agents that accumulate at one point and then respond to the subvisor, but that's limited by the model's response time, not by our infrastructure.

58:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think the ask is, I think you can hopefully, well, hopefully you understand JP's ambition. Yeah. It's way beyond the current profile of the platform. We want to go there incrementally. What we don't want to do is go left when you ultimately know we're going to go right from an architectural point of view. I think that's what we want to avoid. So given that, do we think now is the time to invest in doing segments as opposed to steps?

59:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think now is the time to do some, but maybe not all, of migration. So there's some fundamental aspects that should be quite fast to change, which makes sure we're at least on the right path but doesn't allow for the sequence difference or like I'll make technological modifications that don't affect the front end yet just to make sure we're on the right path in other words.

1:00:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So apologies my brain didn't follow half of what you just said there.

1:00:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm still trying to wake up.

1:00:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
In my head, and see if this makes sense for you, JP, I imagine the page at the moment where we have, I'm going to stop presenting, bring this page up. I just want to make this real for a second and see if this works for everybody.

1:00:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you see this page?

1:00:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:00:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

1:00:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I would imagine that there is in a workshop, we would have a tab that says segments or steps.

1:00:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
You can still call them steps. They're just non-sequential steps. It's almost identical to this, but there is no implied sequence that you go from one to the next.

1:01:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
There is then another tab that calls process map, which would basically say, is there a suggested flow or process flow? Is there a preferred or a default set of process flows? And there might be different scenarios that, as a JP sort of said, well, in this scenario, we would do this. In that scenario, we would do this. If you get stuck, do this. There's some sort of process. Governor, for want of a better world. And then I think there's a third tab, which is the agents. Now, what I think's missing for me, and I don't know whether we do this at the agent or at the step or the segment, is which agent is primary for what step. So a segment, sorry, I'm rambling a bit now, but a segment will probably have an agent that's an expert in that step, which is separate from the facilitator.

1:02:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
That sounds like an interesting idea, but doesn't really emulate a real life workshop.

1:02:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but like in a real life workshop, it's the same members of the workshop that participate all the way through it.

1:02:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess it could differ when you're like, let's say marketing. Let's say a marketing workshop, JP, you're gonna have to correct me here. But like, let's say you're at a phase where you're doing a little segment for your brand colors. Maybe one person is very good at coloring.

1:02:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think we've also got to sometimes move away from the term workshop because it's a set of Objectives, processes, goals we're talking about which don't necessarily mean people in a room and it doesn't necessarily mean a traditional workshop environment. So we are trying to get an outcome from something and that outcome doesn't necessarily emulate a meeting of people or bots, if that makes sense. We could be looking at something which is longer term, which is over a period of time, or it takes The best way to describe it.

1:03:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
Difficult for me to describe it.

1:03:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think of an alternative to a workshop environment.

1:03:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye.

1:03:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
We even like a pitch where people go away and assimilate information and come back and then bring together a synopsis report on it and make a decision. So, so it could be a slightly different process. It doesn't necessarily follow that it's a experts in a room, so to speak. That makes sense. I don't think that makes sense really, but it's, it's, I think there are variations. I'll have to have a little think about how to describe that.

1:04:19 - Jorge Lewis 
It's actually a similar problem. We were figuring out. How we wanted to, we're trying to make a project to speed up our initial development of projects. Um, and we were using the term template, but then we realized if we use the word template, whenever we're trying to decide the vision for this, we're going to be restricted to that word template. And we're going to end up going down that path because we've said template. But in a similar way, we probably shouldn't be using the word workshop, although it's helpful in understanding what we're trying to do here. It might be limiting us to other possible kind of structures of conversation we want.

1:04:51 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well this is a conversation that had occurred many moons ago didn't we about workshop and workshop is very much Cuan's world, Cuan's environment and at the beginning I couldn't understand what we're trying to achieve because a workshop to me was a physical workshop in a room so there's this slight again terminology discrepancies there but I think we're looking for different ways to achieve things. And it doesn't necessarily, sort of, it's not set in stone before you start. And that's, I think, the adaptability there is quite important.

1:05:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
So can you guys see this? I think it's important that we agree at a high level. This is a workshop, by the way, in my head.

1:05:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does anyone disagree? Does anyone have a different word for this?

1:05:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
There are multiple kinds in the picture. That's the only thing that conveys what's serious.

1:05:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, like what we're doing together now, this, since we've been on the phone, these are workshops.

1:06:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Or would you call them something else?

1:06:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean just that there's three clients, are all the three clients in the one workshop?

1:06:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, I mean the calls we're having between us, like you, me, Jonas, JP.

1:06:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, now I understand.

1:06:24 - Jonathan Phillips 
Okay, okay, so this is I just thought of what we disagreed on at the very beginning. You built everything workshop-based, and I did exercises and tasks and activities. And those exercises, tasks, and activities don't form a traditional workshop, but they still have an outcome.

1:06:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
So that was a terminology thing we had at the very beginning. So for me, this is a workshop.

1:06:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's just a wrapper around everything we're doing. I am now about to do an exercise or an activity Okay, so I think we're violently in alignment.

1:07:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I just think sometimes the term The term workshop is associated with one thing in your head and one thing in JP's head Maybe yeah, I mean workshop to me was always a people in a room with a flipboard type

1:07:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
thing environment, so This is an event where we are trying to get to an outcome, which is a workshop. A workshop could be physical. I can go walk in a park for a workshop. I can go sit on a beach for a workshop. That would be a great workshop.

1:07:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I've done workshops where everyone brought in random objects and shit around their house. And we just facilitated some brainstorming with random objects.

1:08:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Certainly in a consulting environment, a workshop would be more formal. It would be a presentation. It would have a very, very tight agenda. You're very clear where you're trying to get to. If you're running that workshop, you're going to get smacked by the partner if you don't get to that outcome. So you're driving it more. Different workshops have different flavors, but they're still all workshops.

1:08:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, you've got gelato. You've got ice cream. You've got vegan bullshit that's not ice cream. But it's all ice cream. There's all flavors. There's loads of different variations.

1:08:40 - Jonathan Phillips 
Facilitator, Bob, let's get back on task and do this.

1:08:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's say you've got three real-world people in a call. They want to do something. Doesn't really make a difference what they're doing. The facilitator is introducing, running that meeting. That does not preclude. Actually, I'm going to bring this over here. That does not mean that any of these guys, agents, cannot also speak to the agent. But we also know that that becomes complex. And actually, what we have here is a behind-the-scenes, and I think it's called the subvisor. And basically, the supervisor All comms go into the subvisor and the subvisor decides who speaks Go in in our in our example yesterday.

1:09:51 - Jorge Lewis 
The subvisor is going to decide what suit they wear the message wears With subvisors the personalities the personality chooser.

1:09:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah But it is a subvisor also choosing. So for example in a meeting, right?

1:10:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
You could have a lull, and you could have me and JP. And we've had it here. And I can see JP looking for body language cues, going, well, who's next? Some role, some subvisor need. If you've got four agents, there's no reason why they might all not try to say the same thing at the same time. That's going to overwhelm people. There has to be some element of throttling and facilitating the internal conversation so that the customer doesn't suddenly get 10 voices going, bleh. Intended redirections.

1:10:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, when I was designing the subvisor design, the biggest problem is that if you try to compare it to a, can you give this example, it's like if you're at a high end law firm, each of the people in a workshop are going to be senior enough to say their own thing. But in this case, it's running the assumption that each of these are juniors and we have, they might be seniors in their own regard, but not with, with like client management, for example. And they go through the subvisor to become senior pretty much. I think the subvisor is the senior saying, okay, you can say what you want to say. You're not going to say what you want to say.

1:11:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
I disagree with that description.

1:11:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because one of the challenges is, like, right now, when I was demoing with JP earlier on, like, JP, you said, one of the things that you prefer is telling your agents you only ask one question at a time. I'm finding that it's not always honoring that. It's doing it better now, but it hasn't always. And sometimes it gets crafty by saying, grammatically, it's one question, but with one question mark. But they'll put two questions with a comma in the question. It's like, what's your target weight and your current weight? That's two questions. But to put it in a single sentence is a single question. So that's not what I wanted to do. So it was quite cheeky. Now, if you have multiple agents, there has to be, if you're in a workshop and you have multiple people, regardless of seniority, the more senior person is just more nuanced at reading the body cues and understanding when to interject. Maybe they're looking at going, Carl's pretty junior. He hasn't said anything in here. I might drop him a message and say, Carl, it's OK to speak up. You've got good things to say. They might be doing things like that behind the scenes.

1:12:28 - Jonathan Phillips 
So I think the best example, again, I could be completely wrong, the supervisor is like the Speaker of the House of Commons. They don't have any value at all except for choosing who's speaking. And the same with a switchboard operator who chooses which conversation goes where but doesn't have the the skill to actually decide what's important, if that makes sense.

1:12:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'd argue it's even better than that because it allows every single agent to speak to it and then it picks out who had the best response and passes that onwards.

1:13:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, is it picking a response or is it merging them together to have like a really nice...

1:13:10 - Jonathan Phillips 
Picking one.

1:13:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so this is interesting this I didn't realize that okay So it has an opinion it basically goes actually the idea agent was sort of talking about bananas.

1:13:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
That's not relevant not doing that Okay, but how far how deep does it go? Does it actually go on content or does it go on protocol?

1:13:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
So content as in expertise on content of what's being said or is it a protocol of a you're dominating or you...

1:13:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's say the idea agent has come up with something and it's an expert in this idea and it says this is the right thing. The subvisor, now if it said it very aggressively the supervisor might go that wasn't very nice or you've asked 17 questions there you can't do that or is it going to say the content of what you're saying is wrong. I think then that undermines the expertise that you encodify into the agents. So I think, JP, I think you're saying, is it controlling etiquette, but not the quality? Like, when I go to these meetings with Google and stuff like that, there's always somebody who's sort of making sure everyone gets to speak. But they're not saying, OK, I've heard what you said. I'm going to change what you said. I'm going to say it better.

1:14:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we need to train the agents to say very good things and the power should reside in the agent and the supervisor should only be etiquette.

1:14:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the SubVisor picks who had the best response or most capable response. If the user asked something about the brand and the brand thought with all its context made a better response than the others, the SubVisor would pick that response because it's better.

1:15:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Actually, that's a really interesting point, actually, because I've been in workshops where, for want of a better term, the minute taker has said something that they're not an expert in, but was actually really insightful.

1:15:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
This is dangerous territory. I know what's happening here, but it's dangerous territory for the supervisor to understand everything. At what point does it have all consuming knowledge to understand what the best answer is?

1:15:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Good question.

1:15:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm trying to find a graph. So I worked on this design with Hasnain quite a bit. We expanded it to include a loop where you have this subvisor picking one message. And after sending that message to the user, the agents are then given a chance again. Hey, do you still want to say this? Do you still think this is relevant? Kind of a way to make sure that if this really was that important, we have to get it through. But I can't find this graph.

1:16:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Jorge, I don't know if you understood or you got JP's question.

1:16:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think we're moving to a new topic now.

1:16:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think it's really important there'll be a clarification on JP's question here.

1:16:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
If the subvisor is able to choose between the content, I've got four agents here and for some reason we're in a part of the workshop. Okay.

1:16:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Business model canvas workshop. I'm going to just bring this image in here for a second just to make it contextually correct. Okay. Can you guys still see my screen?

1:17:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:17:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right. We are in a value propositions. We're exploring that, right? All four agents contribute ideas to what the value proposition is. There's a scenario where all four are valid, all need to be submitted. Some of them are absolutely bonkers and not appropriate because of the context of the meeting. Make sense?

1:17:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
The supervisor should never have an opinion if they're right or wrong. I mean, you could say in scope, out of scope, like if we're having a meeting about agriculture and someone starts talking about coffee making. No, I don't care how good your coffee making is, it's not relevant. So I think the supervisor can keep relevancy, context. But I would imagine in the value proposition, where we're brainstorming, for want of a better word, all four ideas. I'd want to hear all four. It's not just one. There's an assumption there that one answer is the right.

1:18:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but if you're running a real workshop, that's literally impossible. If you ask a question, you can't listen to all four people respond at once. Only one person gets to respond. People can add on to that afterwards. Which is a capability we can add. But if, uh, like there's going to be one person that takes initiative to start speaking.

1:18:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Like for example, a vision workshop where we all write down on sticky notes, the vision, and then we put them together at the end, for example.

1:18:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

1:18:47 - Jorge Lewis 
And so the question I asked, does it pick one or does it combine them all? This whole subvisor is where the bottleneck will happen. There's edge cases where we want all of their input. Sometimes we just want the best one. Sometimes we might want the best two.

1:19:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
So it is a definitive. If it's a quantitative answer, and the answer is seven, then it's definitive. There's only one answer. If it's a qualitative answer, and it's all opinions and insights, then how does the supervisor decide which insight is better?

1:19:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, take the alternative of real life. Someone just asked the question, what decides who is going to speak? It's going to be the one that takes the initiative first, usually. This is just an alternative to showing initiative. It's just letting all of them speak at once. And then it could even be like a random selector, but the improvement of that is a subvisor that selects who it thought has the best answer. How it selects that is decided by the prompt that you write for the subvisor.

1:19:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I'd like to suggest is listening to what you're saying.

1:20:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think there's multiple capabilities here. So I think we know or we certainly think there is a switchboard. So if everyone speaks at once, that it coordinates that speaking. Let's say idea agent in the middle of a conversation with the client. They're running that bit of the thread right now. Let's say like I am doing this conversation right now. If we all start speaking, this thread that I'm having never finishes.

1:20:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
So just go back a step. My idea, this was before we've had this conversation, my idea originally was that each step or phase or call it what you will, had an expert that had veto, So, even though there were lots of contributions, if, for example, it was a strategy decision, then the strategy bot would have veto over everything else.

1:21:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
It would take on all the ideas and then it would formulate it itself. That's how I saw it. I don't know if that's logical or it makes sense in this scenario.

1:21:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding of what the purpose of the SubVisor is. The purpose of the SubVisor isn't to be an active participant in any way at all. It's just what allows a multi-agent conversation to even happen. Like instead of having agents decide who the next speaker is, instead of selecting randomly an agent to speak, the SubVisor just lets everyone speak and then picks who is the best answer. And now what it emulates is just someone's choosing to speak up.

1:21:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, everything you said there made a lot of sense. Until you said the word, it chooses the best.

1:21:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Of course, it can't know it's the best, but it's better than nothing.

1:21:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I think it could be very harmful.

1:22:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's the alternative?

1:22:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, that's where I'm trying to go to. So I think there is a, um, as JP said, so there's solutions though.

1:22:19 - Jorge Lewis 
It's not like we're at a roadblock. Like there's a Jonas, do you remember the cash, uh, the supervisor cash, which I mentioned quite a while ago?

1:22:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Fundamentally, we're making a problem where there isn't really a misunderstanding of the purpose of what the subvisor is doing, because it's not limiting anything. If anything, it's unlocking more capability, more than there is in real life, because in real life, you just have to go off body language. Who speaks next in this one you actually get to like kind of pick and choose who speaks next depending on the responses because it's a fundamentally the subvisor is just a replacement of the bad body language or initiative someone

1:23:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
takes I think there's a disconnect in what we're saying here. So ultimately the the subvisor doesn't choose content, full stop. It chooses the protocol of who speaks when, but all content is assimilated and then a bot will choose which content is best. Is that right?

1:23:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, and best is the arbitrary word used.

1:23:25 - Jonathan Phillips 
And the best depends on the expertise we train on the bots. So that's limited to how well we train the bots to what it decides is best.

1:23:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
And as JP said, in a step here, if we're in step X, one of the agents will be the prime agent. And that's the one here with the border. So that's the first word. Will give preferential treatment to the prime agent for the particular context of where you are in the workshop.

1:23:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's fully possible. Like the real world scenario there would be, okay, we're moving up to this step. Everyone in the workshop knows he's the expert. So everyone's going to be paying attention. If this guy's intending to speak, then we listen to him. Yeah. And the way we're facing that error is telling the supervisor that, Hey, this guy's the expert of this stuff. So give priority to him if he's taking it in a new direction or something.

1:24:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is there, I like that. That makes sense. Does that make sense for you as well? Is there a sense of, like, one of the dysfunctions in meetings is that I'll ask a question, you might start to answer it, Jonas, then Jorge asks another question. So my question hasn't been answered. We then go off and then it can spiral out where we're just taking the conversations and we've created all these branches, we haven't actually closed anything down. So...

1:24:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
You mean we're having a normal meeting, every single meeting that you ever go into?

1:25:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, but if you're facilitating and you're trying to get somewhere, if you're on the hook to get somewhere, at some point you tolerate a little bit of that, but then eventually you just go, okay, guys, need to move on. So the facilitator is that one who's trying to drive to a... An outcome in a period of time. Is there a sense, though, that, for example, if, like, let's say JP and Jorge are really getting into something and you sort of get a sense that there's about to be a massive unlock. So I would call that conversation, you're having a thread. There's a conversational thread going on between the two of you. That needs to be protected so it completes. Because you could be talking for the last five minutes, getting really into it, and then someone just goes, hey, how should we make the website? It's like, oh, no, you just like, you know, there has to be some sense of protecting a thread or a conversation because it's getting really useful.

1:26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I think we're discussing a lot of very useful things, but I think in the end the best way to go forward, maybe not until later in the future, is to add these things as kind of configuration for workshops or to segments. Because maybe one segment you might want it to kind of let the discussion go ask a question on top of a question on top of a question but sometimes you might not want it to sometimes there is an expert sometimes it's let's treat everybody equally there's a lot of these these configurations that maybe are probably better off in making as configurations instead of is this the right way or is this the right way I think this is really

1:26:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
useful by the way what we're discussing here for me and my understanding of how the the technicalities work it's been really useful I won't add in personas JP because that blew my fucking head off What's that so you so

1:27:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
beyond the Asians you then have a persona and a persona is the The way It's how the agent gets expressed so the agent can give content but then the persona takes that content and actually it could be a hey, you're a happy, jovial Christmas elf persona. So everything that that agent gives you goes through that persona and that's how that gets expressed.

1:27:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
So like a different voice on sat-nav?

1:27:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

1:27:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know how you implemented it, but this switchboard initially, or depending how you implemented it, could define the persona. So he has a choice of persona saying, hey, these are the options or Yeah, these are the messages that we've been given. Pick the persona that best fits it, for example.

1:27:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not really. It could work like that for a deck, because there it's kind of X as a single application, but not for JPE's application.

1:28:03 - Jonathan Phillips 
So why do we have persona? What value does that add?

1:28:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
I wouldn't worry too much about it, because the thing is, for example, the idea agents, it can have three agents behind it, which give it context and good research. Pass that down to the idea agent, which is really the persona which finally gets to talk. All the agents in the background that don't talk are still agents, but they don't have a persona to the user.

1:28:33 - Jonathan Phillips 
So some agents and personas are not agents.

1:28:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
For example, in that, there's only one persona, or there's two personas. There's Maria, the coach, and there's, I don't know the name of the other one, but the member. But there can be multiple agents that make up that one person, Maria.

1:28:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. I understand that now. OK.

1:28:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. It's confusing. And then you have persona teams. Let's not talk about that.

1:29:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So going back to the backlog, deleting messages and taking the back step is really important. Reviewing the capability, getting that migrated over is really important. Moving from step to step properly is really important. And then the question is, and that's why I was starting to do that diagram before we went down that rabbit hole is, Do we create segments? Is that the next most important thing to do?

1:29:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think so. It'll quite fundamentally define how you make your fonts and how you do your reviews.

1:29:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if that's the case, if that's going to change everything, is there any point in doing these three things? Because is that polishing a legacy that's not going to exist anymore, and segments needs to become the top?

1:29:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Get rid of those two.

1:29:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Renews aren't infrastructurally connected to segments, so that can be implemented at the same time. Delete message and backstep can be implemented asynchronously.

1:30:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
But my question is, is there any point in me going in and spending loads of days testing and changing the prompts now, as if once you release the segments, it actually basically invalidates everything I've done and I've got to start again?

1:30:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
It fundamentally comes down to the purpose of your testing. If the purpose of your testing is getting to a final version you want to present in depth, no. If the purpose of your testing is understanding the platform better so you can give better feedback to me on how we should move forward, then yes, it's valuable.

1:30:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

1:30:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how long do you think it'll take to do segments? And do you have enough from us to understand what segments need to do?

1:31:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think I have enough to start throwing out the foundation, but something I'd like to define and I'd like to do a workshop with you and JP is defining the main aspects like properties that are required behind the segments and a workshop. So just to give an example of main properties, behind a workshop is the expected outcome of a workshop could be, or outcomes of a workshop. So, for example, for you, Cuan, and you're not getting to know your why workshop, the fundamental properties will be getting an initial goal, getting the measure of success, getting the the fundamental reason why those things that should be saved to a database and stored for later retrieval and use in the application. That's an example of a main property that needs to be defined from or gotten from the workshop. And also I think segments will have the same kind of things where we need to figure out what are the main properties of the segments that need to be implemented.

1:32:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
to be able to support both JP's workshops, your workshops, and workshops you may see yourself using in the future or making in the future. Does that all make sense?

1:32:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me play that back to see if I understand. So you basically need to understand the marketing, a marketing workshop in more detail so that you'll basically design the appropriate solution.

1:32:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think we're fully aligned. I more need to sit down with you and JP and just figure out which properties a segment has to have and what properties a workshop has to have in the final vision so that I develop it in the correct direction. For example, now a step has an outcome and a purpose. Those are probably not the best two fields to have. I'd like to discuss with you guys more what things a segment needs.

1:33:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, JP, as I understand it, and I might be completely wrong here, there's no difference between a segment and a step. It's just that a step at the moment is implied to be sequential. I go step one to step two. The big difference between what we have and what we're talking about is the order of them. And the fact that I can go, 1, 2, 3, 7, 3, 1, influence 3, 1, the other.

1:33:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, just to give you an example, a property that you're very showing me that you want is to define an expert per segment. That's a very defined property that a segment needs to have, right?

1:33:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:34:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
So that could be like a drop-down selector, who's the agent that's the expert of the segment. And I just want like one day to go in with you. You guys can just knock down what are the things.

1:34:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't want to delay this. I wonder if we can do this like...

1:34:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need to go and walk the dogs. Dog, singular. I mean, JP, do you have a sense of a schematic for a workshop?

1:34:26 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'll have a little think. Because what's in my head now probably isn't the right, necessarily the right thing. I just need a little thing to make sure we capture it.

1:34:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
I also have bad memories now.

1:34:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
If possible, rather than going away, because if we go away, we could go away for days and days and days. I don't think this is a hugely.

1:34:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Absolutely not. I was thinking tomorrow, tomorrow, like same time, 9am.

1:34:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Why not today?

1:34:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have badminton now. Well, we can do it tonight. But just I know there's structural things I can program that are independent from the properties.

1:35:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
So there's things I can work from that may even give me more context for when we have that meeting.

1:35:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

1:35:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, I think I have an answer. What might be interesting is presenting the answer potentially wrong. And then you guys have something to react to that says why it won't work, what it needs, because that's better than starting from a blank sheet of paper.

1:35:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK. We can do it tonight, then, if you want, if you guys have time.

1:35:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I've got to get a travel vaccination jab this evening, so at 2. But yeah, I'm around. I just don't know how well I'll be. I don't tend to react to vaccines. All right.

1:35:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think, I can't remember, I went kite surfing in Egypt once and I had to get one and it nearly killed me.

1:36:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you'd be much better off getting the disease.

1:36:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think I have to leave in about 30 minutes, just so you know.

1:36:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'm going to go walk the dog, I'm going to let this percolate and then I'll have a think about stuff and I'll share stuff asynchronously on the chat.

1:36:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, sounds good.

1:36:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
And JP, if you have any thoughts about this as well, just ping it away. All right, so Jorge, are we going to move Hassan over and start the review migration? That feels like a no regrets move.

1:36:30 - Jorge Lewis 
We can do that, yeah. Yeah, we'll do that. Jonas, can I just have you for a second there? We can plan that out.

1:36:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, just make sure that makes sense.

1:36:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the main goal is bring Hassan on to that project. I think so. He's mostly done with the milestones and the streaks, so I think it's good timing. We'll see.

1:36:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cool. All right.

1:36:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cheers, guys. Cheers.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (3).txt"

Mon, Jul 1, 2024

0:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm dead. She... I'm dead.

0:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nah.

0:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Those are kind of cherry on tops.

0:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Welcome back. Welcome back.

0:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

0:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'm sorry, JP. I sort of broke up there. Do you think that sort of hybrid approach probably is the best way?

0:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

0:59 - Jorge Lewis 
No. Nope.

1:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
We can read your lips a little bit.

1:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we're struggling to hear JP at the moment.

1:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you want to speak as well?

1:34 - Jorge Lewis 
But I guess they can hear us. Can you hear me?

1:42 - Jorge Lewis 
No, we can't hear you.

1:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think that's kind of a cherry on top because either way, the bot needs the info. So whether it's done through a chat or whether it's done through those bubbles, that's a cherry on top in terms of UX.

2:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but I'm just trying to figure out, if we go down just the chat window, then there's a lot of UI pages that we don't need to bother building.

2:13 - Jorge Lewis 
I agree as well.

2:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, I think there's an echo.

2:22 - Eksno 
Why is there an echo now and there wasn't before?

2:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know.

2:28 - Jorge Lewis 
If you don't mind muting.

2:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yeah, for, for having it all on one kind of one screen, similar to JP is actually having it all on one screen where they can chat with the ball and there's just really useful buttons. Just picking the buttons, right. Where the real estate is really valuable because on a phone, it's, I mean, mine, at least it's very tiny.

2:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

2:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
And just trying to figure out how do we, yeah, I think we want to try and crash this in together. You could have a persistent banner at the top around their streak and their achievements, and then the main chat interface, and then the next best action could be a couple of buttons that appear. And so we figure out, oh, you haven't entered in your walk or your calories today. So those two buttons would be there. But obviously, you can override that with any text, with any chat. And then you can always say, yeah, how are you doing with my walks? And that would present the chart rather than having the chart on another page.

3:29 - Eksno 
Hold on a bit. Jorge's audio has completely got defunct.

3:35 - Eksno 
No worries.

3:38 - Eksno 
I think the main point we're trying to highlight though, is that if we get the chat interface working like completely for everything, then we know in the future, like we can add all those like nice UI features, those shares and stuff like that. We know we can add those. The things that we need to prove the core of the application of that will be the chat interface. That's like the unique value proposition to the customers. So all those shortcuts and everything for adding the easy numbers, those can be edited afterwards. They're completely isolated tasks.

4:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I suppose what I was thinking when we talked about discussing the LMS, the current wireframe suggested that there are pages of, this is all your eat history and your chat history. Or not chat history, but your eat history and your move history. And I'm going, I don't know if we need that.

4:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we can maybe look to prioritize the chat interface with some hot links or some sort of dropdown menus that provide me to go into other areas, rather than building a web page with lots of pages, a website with loads of pages, or an app with loads of pages.

4:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:54 - Eksno 
Jorge, is your audio working now? Oh, OK. Yeah, so for the LMS, the features we were planning to prioritize was like the video system and the course system where you can put out the articles and the drip feed functionality. So I don't know the interval releases and all of that. The calorie tracker and all of that, we were planning to have as part of the chat interface. I didn't know you wanted those as part of the LMS, but it seems like we're aligned and that we want that to be part of the chat.

5:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, sorry. I mean, the LMS is just the management aspect, but there is still then the presentation of that content in terms of the original wireframes.

5:36 - Eksno 
But I'm wondering whether there's a way to skip that traditional approach Are you talking about the calorie and the information about the user, the tracker, or are you talking about like the videos that are posted, that are articles that are posted, the courses?

5:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll show you now. Wait two seconds.

5:58 - Eksno 
OK.

6:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you see my screen?

6:10 - Eksno 
Your mic isn't working yet.

6:14 - Eksno 
Can you see that?

6:15 - Eksno 
Yeah, I can see it.

6:18 - Eksno 
So this was the original sort of content?

6:22 - Eksno 
Can you give me one second? I'll give Jorge my webcam and see if he can get the microphone and that to be working.

6:29 - Eksno 
Huh? Oh, okay. I'll just, yeah, I'll just be, yeah, I can give you.

6:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, go ahead. So this was sort of like the idea that the original page, whether you go to the website or you're on the mobile app, would look like, So you have reach week. You've got your week control navigator. You can see what you've done. You've got your daily tracker. And then these sort of white boxes in the middle are the content for that day. And then you've got your tracking actions underneath. And then you've got Like if you want to go down here, you've got your progress. So here's your progress for Eat, Move, Sleep, and Mind. So you can see your short overtime. This was the sort of trackers and progress trackers. So this is all the UX and screens that we were looking at having. And I'm now wondering whether there is a possibility that we just skip all of that and we have a chat window like this. You've got your streak, you've got your one hour, five kilometer, like this could be walk time, walk distance. And I can just click on them and put the numbers in rather than having to type. But if I want to chat, I can chat. So I was trying to figure out how do we crash all of this into this one page and create as a single page as this sort of hybrid approach of both chat and text input. The thing is, if I scroll around here and I go, oh, look, wow, I can see all these charts. They're there. But if you get rid of all those pages and you just have a chat interface, the user has to know to ask about them. So that's a different problem to fix. Now, if I look here, where is this thing? Like this here. You see the way you've got these sort of pop-ups here? Where am I? Upload a photo, take a photo. So we could create this sort of power window where everything's available in there. And if you click on where I am, all that's doing is setting the context for the conversation to the bot, some predefined scripts. Or at least says, oh, here, this is now what you're talking about. Do this I think over time users would just learn they could ask them about whatever they want but we know that yeah they don't know that or maybe it's all achievable by giving a demo and we tell we educate people and we give them full four exercises to do and they go everything's in the bus amazing That could be really interesting, since those buttons could literally be pre-written prompts that you made.

9:12 - Eksno 
Like, how far have I walked could literally be just when you click the button, it automatically sends a pre-written message to the bot.

9:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. It could be anything.

9:25 - Eksno 
Yeah. I think all of that should be possible. It shouldn't be an issue. All of that is just standard web development.

9:34 - Eksno 
Yeah.

9:37 - Eksno 
What is the scope that you want from the LMS then? Because my interpretation was that the core part of the LMS was going to be the videos that you post and the articles and drip feeding that to the customer, to the user.

9:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
The LMS is basic content storing, content drip feeding. And there is content that will be available for a day, content that might be available for a month, and content that might be available for, well, content's available for a period of time and is only available from a date. So it's drift freight content and it has a shelf life.

10:17 - Eksno 
From a date that's bound to the user or bound to absolute time? I'm assuming it's bound to a user.

10:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because when we originally started this, we were thinking that like, like there's a competitor and they do three intakes a year for their program. And now we're like, I don't know. I think we're going to have a different time to market. So I think we should be having, you know, if you sign up today, well, we've started already this morning. So you'd have to wait a week to do next Monday. I think if you're making customers in this climate, wait for a month, that feels.

10:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

10:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
if not even three months. So I think every Monday, we'll start a new program. So you won't be starting it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday or Thursday. But I think once a week, it starts. And then people have a cohort. And then we're trying to figure out is we're going to be looking to do one live session a week. How can we do that across different groups that are at different parts of the journey? But I think that's feasible. It'd be nice if you've got people finishing, celebrating, and people starting. And there's ways I think we can make it a positive rather than a challenge.

11:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

11:23 - Eksno 
Does that make sense? Yeah.

11:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
But yeah, so I think that's the next thing. We need to do the workshop for IntelliAgent, but I'm trying to figure out what that UX might be for the chat.

11:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you have any demos, or you have any thoughts yourself, or anything to point me to, let me know. Because I don't want to over-engineer stuff that you then have a more clever approach to.

11:53 - Eksno 
I'm thinking for IntelliAgent, the chat window can basically be what we made for Itino, because Itino is already a chat interface where you're talking to multiple bots, and multiple bots can talk before it goes back to the user. So it basically just chat bubbles with the profile icon of the agent plus the name next to it. So like, Jorge?

12:23 - Eksno 
Yeah, like a WhatsApp group chat. He's yelling.

12:31 - Eksno 
Do you see an issue with using basically a WhatsApp group chat UI where it's just profile icon, the name of the agent, and they're talking?

12:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
No. I mean, that was pretty much what I envisaged on the screens that I had almost with a whoever was not reading at the moment, but talking at the moment. You had their avatar and you had their content.

13:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
There's different ways of doing it. There's no necessarily right way. And until we get to the point of starting to work out what the best user experience is, you know, we can't just say now this instance that it's going to be that way. I know obviously you've got to think in advance of how to put it together, but we also have to think about usability and do some testing to make sure that it works because it might look pretty or might look effective, but it might completely fail as far as the communication method.

13:33 - Eksno 
Yeah.

13:36 - Jonathan Phillips 
So obviously we have to have a target and go for something. We have to have an idea of what we want, a concept, but we have to keep it quite loose until we then work out the best way for it to work for the user. Because obviously the user is the person who's going to be using it and paying for it. And if it doesn't work for them, it's going to fail.

13:56 - Eksno 
Yeah. You you I'm very confident the UI, like how it will work, will be one where it feels like the user is in a room or a group chat with a bunch of agents. I don't think we should separate them into different chats. I think that would actually make our job easier. Quite a lot harder, because then we have to make a really good UX to make it obvious whose chats you should go to, and a lot of like that. Meanwhile, we've already proven, we've already created, like, for example, IT, now, where you are chatting with multiple agents.

14:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but just an idea of how they are solving the problem with the user not kind of is one solution is summarizing the turn of the bots. So if the bots have a, let's call it a turn, that summarizes that turning, these are the main points that you need to reply to. Another solution could be to convert to voice all the messages and play them using different voices. That way, what you need to write to do is listen. The text that you write is the same, but behind the scenes, there's a voice playing. We're not behind the scenes of some simple stop or pause the play button. And then, yeah, I feel like one of those two or both works as a kind of solution if we figure out that's the case where the user is just not able to digest all the info. And we can also just tell the bots, hey, don't reply with paragraphs.

15:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually you don't reply with paragraphs when you're in a group setting. In a conversation.

15:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, cool. We should wrap it up, it's getting pretty late. So anything else that's probably, that isn't going to be in the brainstorming session next time, next Thursday?

16:01 - Jorge Lewis 
And for QM, we can discuss the LMS sometime, I'll let you know on text tonight.

16:07 - Jorge Lewis 
That's good.

16:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, thanks so much for your time.

16:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Hope to see you guys soon. Take care guys. Have a good day.

16:17 - Eksno 
And you. Bye bye. Have a good day. Bye bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (30).txt"

Mon, Jul 1, 2024

0:00 - Eksno 
Yeah, I can.

0:01 - Eksno 
You cannot.

0:03 - Eksno 
I noticed during that archival, literally if I'm facing towards you. Yeah, I can hear my echo when I look towards you. I went back and just turned around when I was talking during the call earlier, because then it wouldn't echo. It's like a cardioid mic or something.

0:26 - Eksno 
So no echo.

0:28 - Eksno 
Very tiny in the background.

0:33 - Eksno 
Maybe if you moved one chair to the right, there wouldn't be any.

0:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I can go to that table. Okay.

1:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:08 - Eksno 
Yeah, very good.

2:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
Very good.

2:15 - Jonathan Phillips 
What time is it over with you?

2:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it just on nine?

2:19 - Jonathan Phillips 
Have a good day.

2:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Is anyone else joining?

3:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm just going to get my volume up here. I'm not quite hearing you.

3:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, go again.

3:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it my mic?

3:13 - Eksno 
Your mic is fine.

3:14 - Jorge Lewis 
OK. I was just asking if anyone else is tagging along today.

3:20 - Jonathan Phillips 
I've asked Kieran if he wants to join us, but he's got a busy day, I think, at the office. Let me just have a check.

3:31 - Jorge Lewis 
It is recorded, so I could send it to them as well.

3:34 - Jonathan Phillips 
Cool.

3:39 - Jonathan Phillips 
Right, I mean basically nothing sophisticated, just wanted to give an overview of what I see the project being as a whole, just so that you can start to position in your minds what you need to do, sort of what the end goal is. And what we're trying to achieve because it's probably a mistake if I keep everything in my head and then expect you to know it. So that's not going to work very well. So hopefully this will just give you a quick overview of what the concept is. I prepared sort of like four or five quick slides and they are just basically mock-ups of the way I think things could be done. And again, I have no prescribed idea. This is just a complete sort of sandbox for discussion. I have an idea and a vision of what I think we can achieve. But obviously, I'm very happy to take your knowledge and the direction that you think it could go in as well.

4:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
Great. Sounds good.

4:44 - Jonathan Phillips 
Right. So if I just show you these slides, Well, I've got so many windows up here. Let's try this one.

4:58 - Jorge Lewis 
I can see it.

5:11 - Jonathan Phillips 
Right, so if I...

5:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm going to stop something because I'm doing the whole window there. Let's try it again. Technology failure. All right, so.

5:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
The way I see things, we're targeting small businesses and people who aren't very marketing or business savvy. So we want something that's very, very simplistic. If we can get everything onto one screen, I think all the better. This doesn't account for the likes of the admin screens and the backend stuff. This is just purely usability-wise. So originally I thought maybe we could have the journey of the framework on the left-hand side, a chat area, guides and supports, and obviously any output together. But it does kind of crush everything a little bit together. So what I thought was that we could then move over to something slightly different. Which has a toggle feature at the bottom on the left hand side.

6:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
So basically we can have the chat area expanded, it's possible to have a better discussion and then when you want to look back on where you are in the frameworks you can toggle.

6:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you just go back and forth between one and two?

7:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yes, sure. So So as far as the toggling goes, the toggling will be more like this. So it wouldn't go to a new window on the left. It would pretty much take up the chat area. So you can have a look at where you are, and then you go back to the chat area again, rather than have another column, so to speak.

7:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I just have a suggestion. This is all pretty, I mean, this is not really important information, but this is just a suggestion for Laying Down the Road, since we're just kind of throwing things out there. An idea is having the left, like having it as a column on the left, where only the letters of story are shown. And then if they hover over it, then it expands into saying what they're doing, or like an arrow button where they can toggle it.

7:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
Absolutely, absolutely. Again, this is just an idea so that you can get in your head what we're trying to achieve. So as far as the cosmetics, the base functionality, again, it's not been thought through that clearly. So again, when we're talking about multiple agents, so that the user knows where they are, we could have something where they have a little avatar, so they know in the chat window who they're actually talking to. And it also personalizes the whole journey so that they feel like they're actually talking to a person rather than just the machine itself.

8:24 - Eksno 
I think I recognize that avatar.

8:27 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think you do.

8:30 - Jonathan Phillips 
So the last one here, again, on the left-hand side, the chat area, but on the right-hand side, more detail on the two sections, the top section. So this would just be guides and supports on the particular area you're on with the framework. It might include a couple of templates or a spreadsheet you might need to download. And again, this would be stored here. You'd have the opportunity to download or view depending on what it was you're looking at. It might just be a guide, an A4 page of thinking, so to speak. So you have a read of it and it gets you thinking, and then you can actually discuss with the chatbot how to actually take that forward. The output at the bottom right Again, it's just a, we're gonna have so much sort of output as far as bits and pieces, we have a scrollable window, and then the cumulative plan, and again, we won't call it a marketing plan, we'll call it something else, but just for sort of a positioning at the moment, we have a plan that everything comes into, so at any point, you are building this one document at the bottom, And then that is your output, so to speak. And again, if you manipulate any of the documents, it will then change your output at the end.

9:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the cumulative marketing plan, is it literally just all of the pieces put together or are they combined in a sneaky way?

10:04 - Jonathan Phillips 
Again, open to suggestion for both. If we can combine it with some lead in and lead out for each one, all the better. We just want to make it easy to use. But again, we are sort of wanting to decrease the amount of functionality that will extend the development period. So we have a list of brilliant things we'd like to do, but the reality is it makes sense to have something that works and then build on that as we go along, I think.

10:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay. One big thing that I want to make sure We go through and then also you separately on your own time is how we're going to be better than the other competitors because I, we still don't know if it's a smoke and fog and mirrors for the other companies, but what they're showing is quite promising. Like marketing. Have you had the chance to try them out or are they? Yeah.

10:58 - Jonathan Phillips 
So, so, so they, at the moment, all they have released is a single box doing social media. So they talked about having this virtual marketing agency with all these bots talking to them, but it doesn't exist at the moment. And I think it will take them a while to do that, as it will for everybody at the moment, unless somebody saw a vision many months ago, which no one else did, which I don't believe. However, this one bot that they have at the moment isn't very good. It is a very poor implementation of what they should be doing. Considering the person who starts the business is a marketeer, and their background isn't a software company or development. They have built something that has missed the point. It really has. So I feel good the fact that they haven't built this all singing, all dancing bot that does fantastic stuff. And then the next level is they're going to integrate it with other bots. They're not there yet. They really aren't. So they haven't perfected it. And even if they bring them together, the bots, I don't think they're going to do it properly at the moment. So kind of a relief.

12:06 - Jorge Lewis 
showing how they did the first step, I can see there's a bit of a dilemma they're going to have, which is, should we transition the entire thing or should we try to continue with this and having separate bots and try to combine them? They're going to have a dilemma on the tech side.

12:22 - Jonathan Phillips 
However, again, one of the key requirements for me is to go to market as soon as possible, as it is with every business. So I thought maybe there's the possibility of the first phase actually building a single bot that mimics multiple bots. It wouldn't necessarily have the technical functionality of a multi-agent system. But for the purposes of what we're trying to achieve, it will probably achieve 80% of what we want. And as a first get out to market, it might be good enough. I don't know. But I've put some thought around it and I can send you some thinking if that makes any sense. I don't know how quick I don't know if it would reduce the development time by half or by 25%. I don't know. But I think it would be something worth considering. Because again, once the interface is done and the bot, we can do the multi-agent thing simultaneously once we get moving.

13:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So in terms of the tech side, I hope Jonas, I think, I don't know if you're okay, I think you're frozen. In terms of the tech side, Jonas correct me as well if I'm wrong, but I don't think that'll save us time since behind the scenes, we're better off doing the multi-agent thing from the start. Like what I can see is, maybe this is what you're referring to or I'm mistaken, but just a single bot that goes through the workshop.

14:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

14:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Um, I don't, I think the multi, I think we should go for the multi-agent off the bat. I don't think it's, I don't think the work, the difference in work is worth it because this one won't be very capable. It's not going to be very impressive. And I don't, I don't think it'll, I don't think it'll be able to achieve kind of the purpose of this, which is to, to really build a strong marketing plan and to educate the user. Maybe, but I think the effort that's going to be put building that and making sure that's working like to our quality is going to be the same as if making a multi-agent system out of the box.

14:46 - Jorge Lewis 
You wanna say something Jonas?

14:49 - Eksno 
Yeah, I think it will actually take longer optimizing a single agent to be anywhere close to the quality that we want out of it. How I like to think of multi-agent systems currently is basically taking one big bug that's trying to do, for example, five different tasks with this huge prompt, and just taking each of those prompts, separating them, and then having them... It's basically calling the LLM using one prompt at a time. It makes it easier for us to implement, actually.

15:32 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, it was just throwing the idea out there. Obviously, if it was something that would decrease development by a considerable margin, then it would be worth, I think, at least having a discussion about how we implement that.

15:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Bye, Brian. Hey, guys.

15:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
How's it going?

15:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, how's it going?

15:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I didn't add this in the calendar, so I didn't.

15:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I forgot it was calendar.

16:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, JP's just gone through the four slides, kind of the UI, to show what it should look like, And then we discussed if we should start first with a single agent or a multi-agent. We're leaning towards multi-agent, just the way JP described it feels like that's the better route to go.

16:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't see a proposition. I don't see the single agent proving anything.

16:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't see any learning.

16:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yes. Okay. So now that we've gone through that, uh, is there, is there anything before that? Cause I do have, I kind of want to update in terms of our side, what's been going on, but anything else you want to kind of share?

16:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool.

16:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, so yeah, the past week or two weeks, I can't remember. We've been looking for new developers for AI developers specifically. Uh, actually what line chain, which is the framework reason. So they're, they're experienced with lynching. We found two that were kind of, what do you call it when you're just paying them or paying them pretty much like a trial where we're doing like a trial with them.

17:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Just testing them.

17:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Just, just testing them. Really. One of them is super promising. Um, The other one hasn't clicked yet. We're still waiting to see is there potential, is there not potential, and how much effort would it take to get it. And then on the other side for the website, which JP, this is not kind of relevant to you more for Kuwin, but just for the website, we're onboarding one web developer. So we're going to be testing him with LMS. And if he doesn't work out, we'll have Nazif work on LMS. And he's going to be done on the project he's working on in a couple weeks, two weeks.

17:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yeah, so with that said, I do think we do have the capacity now to, to take on story for, um, for an MVP, but also I'm still thinking that. I think we should still move forward with the POC as the goal, because with that in place, then we can decide to move forward or not. Um, what do you guys think? Because I think to reach the MVP, we're going to have to reach the POC regardless. There's a little bit of overlap that we want to avoid if we were trying to go straight to the MVP.

18:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Apologies if you've already covered this. Can someone like yours or Janos, can you guys paraphrase what the difference between the MVP and the POC is? Three letters.

18:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. The POC would just be one, well, like three pages, the user's chat page, the admin page to change the prompts. And then we'll just leave it at those two, really those two main ones, maybe some accessory ones, but those are the two main ones. And then the MVP would be some...

18:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, forget about the solutioning of the, of the, of the MVP. What can I get? What can I do?

19:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
What could we do as a, as a, as a IntelliAgent?

19:09 - Jorge Lewis 
With a POC, you'd be able to let people try it out. You'd give them the URL, and they can go try it out. No sign up, nothing like that. Users would be able to sign in, pay for it, the user onboarding stuff.

19:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does one do the other? Is one the first part of the same path? Because a lot of POCs are disposable. You're not intending to build upon it. Because I can see a legitimate case where the first phase of the MVP is functional because sign up, blah, blah, doesn't prove anything. It's necessary, but not sufficient.

19:45 - Jorge Lewis 
And those things are added on as well. They're not something where you need to throw away the smaller thing to add those on.

19:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because a POC can be self-contained and completely disposable. It's purely just to prove something. If you're doing an MVP approach, the first phase is functional, and then you would add on the necessary reg pages, sign up, blah, blah, afterwards. Then that's just the sequencing of the MVP as opposed to a POC or MVP. So I think I just want to tighten up on the language there. No one's wrong. By the way, it's just a difference. I just want to make sure that we understand.

20:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's a good point. What's the main difference behind the MVP and the POC for you, JP? Is it more of just you're trying to say, let's let us move forward with this, or is there actually something that specifically you're thinking of

20:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
When we originally commissioned the proof of concept. It was a little while ago and we were sort of dabbling with the premise that a multi-agent model might work, might not work. We wanted to see it in action. I think now it's not as important because I think we're pretty comfortable with where the market is and who's doing what and it's moving forward very fast and I don't think we need to prove the concept as such.

21:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
However, we would like something to show people that we're really nice. If it deflects from us moving on with the MVP too much, then it might not be worthwhile.

21:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I don't think it'll deflect too much, Jonas, you might want to correct me, but what I think would happen is we'd build something very similar to the POC and be able to reuse most of it for the MVP. The big thing that I don't think we'd be able to reuse is something like designing, going from kind of hard coding one workshop into trying to make it so that giving you the capability to create all the workshops, something like that. And then also the different, these are the things that would be added on, but they're kind of, they need to be integrated, which are things like the, uh, the file management that you showed us in those slides, like the file management, the, what was the top one? Just the, those two on the right side, I can't remember.

22:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, the guides and the references are top right and the output at the bottom.

22:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Apologies, I don't know what you showed them. Is this the same thing that we were talking about the other week or have you evolved it?

22:21 - Jonathan Phillips 
I've evolved it a little bit. Let me get it up again.

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
So is marketing trying to be, are they trying to execute the plan they make as well?

22:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
like automated?

22:39 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yes.

22:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
We can only go by what they've explained in their marketing blurb. There's nothing to show that there's any reality with it yet. It's just a lot of marketing screens.

22:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
Can you see that, Curran? Yeah. Right. So, so originally the idea was potentially something on the left with the, uh, where you are in the, in the journey through the framework, chat area in the middle. Guide and support to the particular area of the framework you're in top right and then the outputs bottom right. And then I thought maybe it'd be better to have a toggle at the bottom of the chat screen rather than have an extra column so that you could toggle up and down the framework whereabouts you are. Then the thought was we'd have some avatar so that we could personalize which bot or coach you're working with, because then it would feel more of a personal experience than you were actually working with people. And then lastly on the right hand side, Just elements there where you're able to download or view various templates or spreadsheets, depending on where you are in the framework with the top right bit, or maybe it's just a reference sheet. And then the bottom right, the outputs, a scrolling number of documents that you're creating as you go through the journey, and then accumulative documents at the bottom, which is pulling all that in together.

24:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. What are the other screens? Are they just variations of the same thing, or?

24:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, yeah. I mean, basically, it's just my thought process of originally having the three areas, and then having a toggled area on the left, and then personalizing it a little bit, and then having more detail on the right-hand side.

24:31 - Jorge Lewis 
I have a question.

24:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
How I mean In one way me shutting up now is probably a good thing because you guys will probably get alignment and another way It's a really dangerous thing because I could open up doors box with the level of questions. I have What do what do you want to do?

24:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I Just have a question for the It didn't look like it but it looked like you only wanted to one bought to try to the to chat to the user at the same time Ideally, I'd like a Zoom screen

25:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
with nine human-looking people all talking together, but we're not there yet. So I wanted to keep the simplicity to start with. If we have multiple bots all there at the same time, I would imagine it adds another level of complexity, which will take us longer to go to market.

25:31 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I think for what you're trying to prove with intelligence, I think that should be what we're trying for. Because it's what you described to me the last time we spoke was how it's like a tape, you're sitting at a table where anyone can chime in at any point where they think they have something important to say. And if it's only one part at the same time, then you don't have that.

25:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, from a level of excitement point of view. I like the layout and the style, but having one bot, for me, I can go and do that. From an experiential point of view, I can go and do that on our tropics right now or Chachi BC. I think the multi-agent thing is that there's two things I would add to that. If you could just bring up the screen for two seconds, JP. And by the way, guys, JP, shut me down if you don't want to go down this path, by the way.

26:23 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, go for it.

26:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So can you go to the one slide four with the bot? Personally, for me, the framework is a nice guide, but it was taking up too much retail space. So the fact that you brought in that toggle, I think is the right thing. I think in this chat or this workshop chat window, you have to see the team you're working with. I think it's really important that the team is there. I think the other thing that's really interesting on the guides and support, I think there are other bots that are sitting over there offering you dynamic guides and going, oh, imagine a load of junior consultants who don't say anything in the meeting, but are busy working away. And they give the partner, I just found this, because that's their job. They don't say anything in the meeting, but they make the partners look good. So if you look at the partner grade bots being the ones that are talking to the client, but they have bots in the background doing research on other names, other, I keep on going back to this mission statement thing. Like let's say this workshop was getting towards their mission statement and another bot is out looking at, oh, that sounds very similar to Tesla as well. And so it would pass that information or it would provide a tip. In the guides and support. For me, the multi-agent is the thing. That's the killer punch. Without that... I think so as well. I think it's a real...

27:47 - Jonathan Phillips 
I agree, but I think this is probably my mistake for dumbing it down. I think what I need to know is if you were going to develop something similar to what I've sort of suggested there as a first draft, If we're going into a sort of environment where it's really dynamic, you've got multiple bots doing different things on the screen at the same time, what are we talking in development time between the two? I know it's a piece of string, but...

28:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So your goal is to minimize the development time while introducing the main feature, which is building a marketing plan while educating the user, right?

28:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Okay. Could you ask the question again? I just wanted to make sure that was clear. Sorry.

28:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. It's basically the dumbed down version I've given you. What's the difference in development time and effort for something like that, as opposed to a very dynamic environment with lots of bots working together visually on the screen? What elements are we talking of differentiation? Are we talking months?

29:05 - Jonathan Phillips 
Many months? It's very difficult because it's how long is a piece of string, but what in your eyes is the difference?

29:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can I have a time to extend that question a small bit? So as I understand it, IntelliAgent is about having multiple bots that can interact to achieve an outcome. And that workshop has an outcome and potentially a process associated with it.

29:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you have those building blocks, I think you can do lots of shit with it. So I try to genericize things as much as possible. If you take ADAPT, what does ADAPT give IntelliAgent as a core capability? It's to have a bot and to have an administrative screen that can give that bot feedback to do something. What's missing is the ability for another bot to interact with those bots and for that interaction to be refined at scale for multiple bots. And then the third part that's missing is the sense of a workshop, where a workshop might have guides, it might have an outcome, and it might have a process, some steps to do there. So I think if you give us those building blocks, or you give JP those building blocks, Like, I don't know, technically, you might say, well, actually, 1 to 2 working together is one problem. 2 to is fine. Actually, 50 bots is a real problem. What's the scaling issue on the number of bots versus the workshop capability in terms of having an outcome and then the process to achieve it? Because I think there's some capability already in Adapt that we would be looking to enhance around this. So we're not starting, IntelliAgent really isn't starting from ground zero.

31:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. I'm going to answer JP's question first, which was, what's the difference between what he showed and what we would try to make, which is the multi-agent? I think there are two, behind the scenes, I think there are two different, like, Very different designs, two different branches. If you go down the single agent, you're going to really spend time trying to refine that one. If you go with the multi-agent ones, you're going to really go down the branch, trying to refine those ones. So I don't know if you're really minimizing anything by picking the one that looks more complicated.

31:37 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sure. The screens I showed you was still multi-agent. It was just discussing with one at a time. So that wasn't single agent. It was just showing on the screen. But is it just an interface thing with multiple bots talking to each other, or does that lead to a lot of complexity in the back end? As a visual, that is.

32:01 - Jorge Lewis 
From the visuals, I don't know. How would you have a multi-agent with just one bot at a time?

32:08 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, ultimately, the idea of the multi-agent model is that they all have a very niche area of expertise. So when you are in a certain, let's say, marketing area, you need a certain bot because it knows that area inside out. Of course, there's the potential for them to talk to each other in the background and come up with a solution, which is then presented to the user. If it's presented in one dimension, as in, I've spoken to the bots, this is what we thought of, that's the presentation back to the user. But if it's in real time with them talking to each other and having a conversation and then presenting, that's obviously a whole different interface.

33:05 - Eksno 
I don't think it's a question of if it should be multi-agent or single agent really, since I think it's definitely multi-agent. We're using multi-agent in the dApp now because it's easier to make the processes like check-in to be complete and be accurate when it's multiple agents because we're able to refine the prompt so much more to what the situation is. So I don't think it's a question of whether we should go down the multi-agent path or the single agent path. It's just how we should model the multi-agent path.

33:39 - Eksno 
So of course, levels of complexity, we could have as low as two or three bots, one strategy, one researcher, up to having a full team of juniors working asynchronously from the main team, which has their underlings. I think it's more of a question of how deep should the, how many bots should there be, and how we should model that structure.

34:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to answer Cuan's question before I forget, or before it gets blown away. I don't know, I think it has. Okay, yeah. So what's the difference between going from 2 to 3 bots compared to like 10? What I can imagine is that once we have a system made where, for example, for the first workshop, understanding UI, I believe, right?

34:38 - Jorge Lewis 
For that one, let's say there was like three or four bots. I think that can be scaled to any number of bots because the system that we'd be using or the design of the graph that we'd be using would be irrelevant to the number of bots. The system would be more of what we call the supervisor, which is determining who should speak. That's the main thing, depending on if there's a group of three people and 10 people, it'll always be who should be speaking now. That's the main issue. So I think in terms of bots, it'll be scalable.

35:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
You mentioned something there around the workshop, like the values workshop. Why does it matter the nature of the workshop? Can we not just design the attributes of a workshop, whether that be it has an outcome, it has guides, it has a process. I'm making shit up, by the way. I'm not saying that. And so process our steps. You have to train, there's a facilitator bot that would always understand the process of their holding court in terms of how you move through it. Because then we have the capability, because we know we're going to have multiple workshops or steps, whatever you end up calling it.

35:53 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I think is if we're able to lock in the supervisor, or the system that determines who should be speaking, Then from there, we can say, OK, now the easy part is giving JP the access of which agent should be in this workshop, which prompt should they be using, and what is the workshop? Describe the workshop. Then we can do that. But before we're able to get a system that gives us that capability, I don't trust just trying to mix and match.

36:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Make sense?

36:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, I'm really tired by the way.

36:39 - Eksno 
That sounded very arbitrary to where I'm not sure where I want to apply those statements you said.

36:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So we want to experiment with one workshop first so that we know the system we've made and we apply it to multiple other ones. And even then, let's say we I don't think it's a big issue with JP spending a couple hours a week making new workshops with us, in terms of hard-coding. In terms of scalability, of course, that's not the goal in the next year, but for the first few months, I think that's also doable.

37:18 - Jonathan Phillips 
Why do we need to hard-code the workshops if we are going to train the bots on delivering them? Can we not just train the bots with documents and say, this is the workshop, please deliver it in this way.

37:35 - Jorge Lewis 
In case there's a difference between one workshop and another where the graph has to be different, something like determining who should speak, if that has to be different between one workshop and another, that's for example, when something has changed or when in one system or one workshop compared to another, let's say the analyst agent should be given an extra tool to search an extra database or something like that. There's quite a few things, small things, perhaps.

38:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we need to understand what are the attributes of a workshop. And maybe it starts with those three outcome guides and steps, for want of a better word. Let's try and run the first workshop and then see what attributes are missing so that we can enhance that. So we're building a workshop capability as opposed to just hard coding it in. And then the problem is as soon as you start going down the hard coded path, They'll be like, oh, people are excited to see this. Let's hard code another one, and then another one. And then you overinvest in that path. And I think we should be able to do a reasonable bit of brainstorming architecture to figure out what do we believe will be the starting set of attributes to describe a workshop so that you have a workshop designer page, for want of a better word.

38:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because you're going to have to have it anyway, more or less.

39:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Or we could also have JP describe. We could format. So in the same way, we figure out what is a workshop, what are the different aspects of it. Sends us the documents, and then we code it. You're saying that won't work, but why?

39:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Say that again?

39:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So instead of giving you the workshop designer. Inputs the data just in regular text that he would in the workshop designer page. And then we make it in code. That's assuming that making the designer would take a lot more time than it's worth in the first initial few months than to just hard code them. Because also by hard coding them, our team also learns how they should be interacting better. We also figure out workshops better.

39:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, is it really a big deal that we can't, that they're hard-coded or?

40:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't believe hard-coding is part of the longer-term solution. I think we're trying to find a workshop capability. So if you're basically saying there's a learning process and we're going to hard-code stuff just to get it functional so we can understand the attributes, But that means that's all disposable, and we would not have that in the second workshop. I'm just trying to challenge the approach by trying to preemptive. Knowing that we want to get to the fact that we have a workshop building or designer capability, I think we could have a, like, if we spent an hour brainstorming the components of a workshop and what you need to do, I think we'd have a reasonable go for a V1.

40:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Which I think you're going to need to do anyway to design a workshop. I just think we're going to be controlling it through variables, which then ultimately will come into a screen just to design it. I might be oversimplifying it.

41:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, you can raise your hand using the button, by the way.

41:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but that's so much harder.

41:11 - Jorge Lewis 
It's kind of funny seeing Jonas just raise his hand over there.

41:14 - Eksno 
It's so much easier to do this than go to my track pad and go like, OK, where's the button?

41:18 - Jorge Lewis 
There it is. I get a noise when you click the button, though.

41:24 - Eksno 
Yeah. You haven't failed to do loads with me. Anyhow. I think the first one, we should definitely hardcode. I think hardcode is a bit of a misleading term because what we make while hardcoding will largely be copy-pasted over to the next workshop, and then we just change what we need to. And for doing that a couple of times, we should have a very a very clear vision of exactly what needs to change per workshop, at which point we should be in a very good position to create a workshop designer. It will be a whole lot better than if we just created a workshop designer off the bat without having created workshops individually by hand first. It's like trying to create Photoshop without ever having edited a photo.

42:16 - Jonathan Phillips 
So when you say hard code, sorry, when you say hard code, where, where are you hard coding? What elements of the, of the tech is being hard coded? Does that make sense?

42:29 - Jorge Lewis 
The connections between the agents, the tools the agents have, um, those are the two main ones. Anything I'm missing?

42:40 - Eksno 
No, I don't think so. Yeah, it's connections between the agents, how it's decided which agents speak, who the agents speak to, and how the dynamic works, along with what tools they have. So like what codes they can execute, for example, create this thing, create this PDF file, and such.

42:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the question, and I go back to this, JP, as well, is the values workshop I understand sequentially that makes sense to be the first one, but in terms of a wow factor and something that's discreetly usable, is that something that people are going to go, I'd use that tomorrow and I'll wait for the rest of it to come?

43:23 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well, I mean, it's not going to be a commercial proposition anyway, really.

43:32 - Jonathan Phillips 
So just from my basic understanding, when we do the element of hardcoding, it's still a free conversation between user and agents? We're just hardcoding the process, how the bots interact. Is that right?

43:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

43:53 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think just kind of to summarize, To summarize, it's no doubt we'll do the first workshop hard-coded to understand what is a workshop and the system behind it, and then from there we can re-evaluate.

44:11 - Eksno 
It's not only understanding what is a workshop, it's understanding what is the way to implement that workshop. And doing it hard-coded inherently will give it a lot more quality because we can, like, form it to the shape of the workshop a lot more accurately. And over time, figure out what's more generalized to where we eventually can create, like, a workshop designer where the graph is automatically generated or something like that.

44:43 - Jonathan Phillips 
And rough timescales on that, I know it's again a tricky one, but what are we talking about days, weeks, months?

44:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm gonna be totally honest. Kewin's project has made me realize I suck at estimating, so I'm not going to give a number without thinking about it. So I mean months, yeah, not years for sure, but with their new So I noticed one cool thing, by the way, about the presentation you had was that there was a document kind of manager there. So the agents would be able to read and manage and help work on those actual documents. That's a cool feature. But anyways.

45:34 - Eksno 
Jonas, how about you give a number?

45:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So Jonas, I'm going to ask you a slightly different question. If everything goes as absolutely phenomenally good as it could go, how long do you think it would be? And if everything goes tits up, how long do you think it'll be?

46:01 - Eksno 
And it will depend on a lot of those integrations. For example, the document manager that Jorge mentioned, then we'll have to code in the tools for it to open those documents, always check up, make sure it's validated with those documents so they don't just make up something that's conflicting. With the documents, something like that could add a lot of time and remove that lagging. I planned first, but yeah, I think months for the final products, but I don't know how long until you'd have something you can start playing with.

46:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I would say...

46:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, did you say two months?

46:42 - Eksno 
As in months, I don't know how many, but less than six, I'm pretty sure.

46:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. I was going to say best five, tits up 10.

47:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Months.

47:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

47:05 - Eksno 
from the final release with two users, like with monetization and everything, or the scope of that estimation?

47:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, just everything.

47:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, just everything.

47:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I'm going to suggest is, I'm not disagreeing with your time, but taking learnings from ADAPT, I think what we need to do is actually have some very detailed architectural brainstorming sessions together to really start taking this out. I guarantee, and this is not a blamey thing, I guarantee you you're making assumptions that are making this bigger. I guarantee you we're making assumptions that are making it smaller. And I guarantee you we're all not talking about something that's really important. That's what I do know. So interesting ballpark. I would actually say we probably need a good half day going in whiteboarding in real time the architecture and actually forming a proper backlog on the back of this. Taking this inspiration from JP and actually forming a proper project backlog. Breaking that down into similar sized chunks of work and say, right, we think that thing is a day's worth of work. You've done three of them. Actually, they're about two days each. So now you've just doubled your backlog in terms of duration. That's the best way I would advise you guys to start managing the time for other things.

48:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Broadly at five months, how big a team are you putting on that?

48:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Probably two pairs or even one. It depends.

48:50 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the burn rate of that on a week?

48:58 - Jorge Lewis 
We'd have to go back at the numbers since there was a... Yeah, we'll have to go back at the numbers for that one.

49:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
But broadly, you should have an idea of what a team costs per week.

49:12 - Jorge Lewis 
We used to, but we're going to change it up, and I don't want to set expectations anywhere, so...

49:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when can you give us a heads up? Because, you know, suddenly five months, is a significant investment.

49:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we do project-based. So that time is going to be proportional to the cost. But we prefer to do project-based rather than anything else. So the final quote that we usually give is project-based. But I'd be able to give you a number. Well, I mean, for the quote of the project, it would have to be after we do the outlining and figuring out what are the actual features of this.

49:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think that in the live coding session, But ultimately, no matter which way you skin the cat, you have a basic burn rate per team per week. Whatever we work out, whether that workshop pushes it to two months to 10 months, whatever it is, you're still doing a week multiplied by a cost per week multiplied by number of weeks estimate, that's the only variability. And then you've got scope. So your maths, the maths, like whether you understand more or you understand less, the only thing that increases the number of weeks, not the cost of the team per week. So the cost of a team per week is static. What's variable is the number of weeks.

50:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So what we need from you- I'm telling you, we haven't calculated a number for the price of a team yet. That way we're going to price it up.

50:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
When do you think you can come back to us with a price per team for a week?

50:48 - Jorge Lewis 
One to two days. All right, fine, cool. Tomorrow night or?

50:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
That allows us to understand what the investment is going to be, what we think the potential contingency budget we would need and timelines. My gut feeling is that I think there's some really nice features here and I think that we could properly prioritize them and kick some of them out into post MVP and actually do a more refined version. I'm very, very hesitant to start going down hard-coded solutions in a five-month project That's because you're talking a significant investment of time, a significant investment of money. Honestly, five months is painfully long. I'm not saying that you're slow. I'm just saying the market's moving so quickly.

51:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
The market, yeah.

51:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that just doesn't seem feasible to me. And that's what I would want to do in the next session is to start coming up with approaches and brainstorms that gets something out sooner that allows us to start showing people and getting investment potentially, or at least getting excitement. Something has to be usable.

52:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And also just getting things on paper, really. That's also a big part of this.

52:08 - Eksno 
Yeah. I don't think by the end of five to 10 months, we'd have one hard-coded workshop. I think that would be further along the time. Like I said, less in six months he said five to ten months so we haven't estimated that at all really like we still need to get the scope like what it would probably be better to do more like milestone because there are going to be a lot of milestones in this project where they're like first workshop, second workshop, workshop designer, just having the functional aspects down, having more necessary but slight functionality down that isn't more of proving that this works. There's going to be a lot of things, uh, the, uh, just prioritizing everything like that. And then being able to give you an estimate on when each step is going to be finished instead of just when is everything going to be finished? Because everything is so.

53:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
So are you guys in a position to run that workshop? When, when do you want to run it?

53:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Like the, the, um, I understand your one.

53:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So JP's asked for a product. It's very big in scope. You need to give us a quote. We've agreed that we need to run a workshop to take that high-level feature set down into a lot more version of reality while also looking at technical execution. That needs to be run so we can say, right, here's phase one of the MVP, and this is how much it's going to cost.

53:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
you know, in that meeting, we will discover whether it's, you know, the nature of the workshop should be irrelevant.

54:02 - Eksno 
So Jorge, it's a workshop we're doing with them. It's not a workshop we're creating.

54:08 - Jorge Lewis 
It's the workshop to come up with a plan for intelligent. Yeah.

54:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

54:15 - Eksno 
Okay. Is it the mix with this project?

54:21 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, the word workshop is not very, yeah. Anyways, okay, yes, we could probably do it some, today's Monday, sometime this week. Let's do between maybe Wednesday and Friday, second half of the week. Does that work for you guys?

54:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, is there anything else we should go over?

54:54 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm good for the moment. No problems.

55:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I won't be around. I'm around Thursday and Friday. I'm not, I'm not around Wednesday.

55:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

55:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So we'll try for Thursday then.

55:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I mean, I don't necessarily need to be there. You guys can crack on. Um, but happy to be there if you feel it might add value.

55:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sounds good. We can plan it out in the chat. Yeah, cool. Sounds good. Thanks for sharing the slideshow, JP. And thanks, Gwen, for your insights and your useful questions. No worries.

55:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you, oh, I don't know whether JP's, I don't know whether we've lost your audio, JP.

55:46 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, I'm still here. Oh, OK. Can you hear me?

55:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, cool.

55:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you guys want to talk about the Adapt LMS, or are you burnt out, Jorge? I know it's late where you are.

55:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's do it another day, because I also want to include the web dev that will be on that.

56:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. Can I just put something in your noodle for two seconds to sort of percolate and just sort of see when we come back to it tomorrow or later in the week?

56:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
One of the questions, and JP, I welcome your thoughts on this as well. So the legacy thinking is, or the thinking to this point is, is that there was a web page mobile app with pages that you had your ADAPT program week one. And in the week one, day one, and you had all of your content for the day, videos, images, whatever, and you track your information. And then there's the bot. And we've been doing some role playing today, this morning, going, OK, well, I wake up, what happens? Well, I get a notification on my phone to say, hey, you've got stuff to do today, whatever the notification is. So I'm going to click that notification. That's probably going to take me to the chat for the bot. And it goes, hey, the weather's shit today, so make sure you wrap up warm. Let's say we can do that.

57:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then at some point, I'm sort of thinking, I think if we're pushing the bot, I think the chat becomes the main interface, not the legacy clicky pages type thing. And then the question is, I was going, OK, so I think we're going to have to create a hybrid approach. And I had a really interesting shit experience with a bot recently, but actually it gave me some ideas for this.

57:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
If, for example, I want to track my calories, I'd log in. I'd click on Eat. I'd enter 500 calories, 500, 500, Save. That's 500, Save, whatever, four clicks.

57:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
If I want to do that through the chat.

57:49 - Jorge Lewis 
But also the first one, eat.

57:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so it's five clicks or six clicks, right? If I have to type that through the bot, hi, I've eaten this many calories, it's a lot more engagement. That doesn't feel like the most effective use of chat. However, let's say it's in the morning. We know you've probably done your walk now. I'm thinking about putting above the chat window some of these quick link buttons, which you might just be able to go, hey, If you haven't done your walk yet, what distance did you walk? And you can just put the number directly in there. So you have these floating input boxes. So a little bit like the sports app here called Sky Sports. They've just changed the UI. I don't know if you can see. Can you see down here the way they have those sports?

58:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like on LinkedIn, right?

58:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
These are floating. This is a floating menu that's always present if you want to navigate around the sports. So I can go up here on the page, but I've got this floaty navigation down here. So imagine the chat being down here. And this could be enter your calories, do your walk, these static things that are just quick inputs as opposed to having a chat. I think chat is much more powerful for other things. But we've got to try and figure out this sort of hybrid interface. And then I was thinking, like, Do we then, if we can do that really well, do we even need the LMS pages? I know we know that LMS for content management in the background, but in terms of presenting it, do we need it? Just a question.

59:25 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well, my perspective is that you reduce the LMS as much as possible. That's the way that the industry is going. That's the way that the the way that people are inputting data, that's the way it's going. It's all going to go into chat soon.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (31).txt"

0:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

0:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
Hey man. Hey, how are you? I'm fine, how are you?

1:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Great, doing great.

1:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Would it be possible to turn on your camera? It's a lot more human. Yeah, just wait a second.

1:08 - Jorge Lewis 
No worries, man. Thanks, appreciate it.

2:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Can you see me?

2:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, yep. Cool, cool. Look, you're a handsome boy. Come on. All right. Yeah, I mean, it's good to see you now, and now I can actually see you, so it's a lot more better. It feels like I'm talking to someone. Yeah. It's really lonely in this room here, see? There's no one here, so it's nice to talk to someone. All right, cool. So yeah, so... Is that your office? Yeah, I mean, I'm at a co-working space. It's like people just come here to work.

3:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Since I'm traveling around, it's no point getting an office, but it's super nice here. It's very peaceful. I get to get a lot of work in, really focused, so it's nice. I've invited you to the GitHub project, the GitHub repo.

3:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So pretty much what's going on is, like I said in my message, is just that we have a project that we're working on, we're migrating it from Python to TypeScript.

3:33 - Jorge Lewis 
And I'm only familiar with the Python one. I've started the migration, I've imported, I know TypeScript, but I don't know SDK from BlankChain and TypeScript. And some of the concepts are quite different. So I'm struggling trying to do it on time, and also I figure this would be a great opportunity to see what you're able to do.

3:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
So can you guide me through the project?

4:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Just so you know as well, there are two other developers doing the same thing. So we're able to hire all three if you guys are all able to do a great job and we like how we work together. Otherwise, we'll consider it at another time.

4:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for compensation, I still have to decide with Jonas. But I'm thinking I want to be respectful of your guys' time. Although it's kind of a mix between like a technical interview and like a test, I still want to respect your guys' time. So I'll let you know later today if that's okay with you, how we can deal with that.

4:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So for the project, so this is a client's project that we started five weeks ago. It's a chatbot to help Well, there's two aspects. There's the chatbot, and then there's an LMS, Learning Management System, for delivering a course to the user.

5:02 - Jorge Lewis 
We first started, the tech stack is in SvelteKit. It was with Python using FastAPI as an API, but now we've migrated it to all be within SvelteKit under the same project. I've migrated all the code, but now I just need to connect it up and make it work. So all the, kind of the template is there. But just it's not working. So the main thing of the app, what I've understood, so there's a couple of main things. So first of all, the chatbot has to be able to onboard the user. So this one's kind of simple. Just ask the user, hey, what's your name? How old are you? Male or female? What's your weights? All these simple onboarding. And then the main thing in terms of daily use for the chatbot is going to be doing a check-in. A check-in is where the bot's going to ask the user a bunch of questions regarding things like, how far have you walked or how much have you walked today? How many calories have you eaten? Did you sleep? How long did you sleep? These things, so helping with the health. And then provide coaching on it. So the flow is kind of like the chatbot will say, or the user might say, let's start a check-in. It's 7 p.m. The user says, the day's kind of wrapping up and they say they want to start a check-in. The bot will say, okay, cool, how many minutes did you walk today? The user will say, oh, let's say 30. And the bot will update the database for that. And then there will be a coach agent that says, all right, great job. But then there's also a data analyst agent that will kind of read all the data in the past and try to find patterns.

6:46 - Jorge Lewis 
find patterns and come to insights for the rest of the team. And then they'll provide some coaching, say how they can improve if they're doing a bad job. If things are doing well, then the coach will just, then the bot will ask for more info. Until they finish all the items, there's like a list of items. You can check it out on the super base in a second.

7:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Hopefully I haven't gone too specific yet.

7:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me show, Send me your discord by the way. Did you send me your discord already? No.

7:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, I didn't because I actually forgot my password. I had to post. Make a new account. Alright, no worries.

7:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so make a new account, send it to me. I'll invite you to a group chat and you can also meet my co-founder and the rest of the team.

7:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, also, I apologize for any disturbance if there's any, because I'm at a new house. We recently shifted, so I do not actually have a room of my own. I do not have a desk. Don't worry, man. All good. All good.

7:47 - Jorge Lewis 
The mics, the quality's OK. Don't worry. Thank you.

7:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so let me maybe get a screen share.

8:01 - Chinmay Pandya 
Have you migrated all the code from Python to TypeScript?

8:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so the Python is no longer being used. The TypeScript is being used. We've connected it to the front end. So right now, as of right now, today, you can have a conversation with a chatbot, but it's the graph, the line graph, you're familiar with that graph, right? Yeah. Yeah, the line graph is just the router and then a researcher. It's just those two, just like a dummy graph, right? To get the thing set up. So the rest of the work is making it actually the graph that was made in Python. So I feel like it's just the line graph part. So we've connected it to the database, we've connected it to the front end, so all of that's done, but we just need to do the line graph part, which I'm struggling with. Specifically, in Python, the way tools were called was a little bit different. I was able to modify the state through a tool call, but now I'm not, so I have to kind of go a little bit of a different route. But I was hoping you could, you'd probably have more experience and maybe here and there you'll be able to decide on better designs than I did.

9:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sure.

9:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you making the Github account now? I mean the Discord account now?

9:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, I've logged in actually.

9:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Let me send you my username.

10:06 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I'm gonna send you a friend request.

10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you on Windows, by the way, or Linux or Mac? Yeah. I'm using windows.

10:19 - Chinmay Pandya 
So are you getting the error in your code itself or when you're running the application?

10:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's no error. So the problem that I have is just I wasn't able to reach the output. I wasn't able to reach the behavior I wanted.

10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, once I invite you to the group chat, I can send you the kind of the behavior I was expecting.

10:45 - Jorge Lewis 
And I haven't gone through, because I started learning the LangChain TypeScript version just two days ago. So I've only had two days to learn it. But the deadline is next Wednesday for delivering the new migrated project.

11:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
Some of the concepts and the terms have changed when you migrate from Python to JavaScript.

11:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and that's what bothered me because I told the clients, I looked at the, so I knew the Python SDK and I took a look at the documentation for the TypeScript one and I was like, oh, it's quite similar, same concepts. So I told the clients, yeah, we could be done. I told them yesterday. And then in the past few days, when I started learning like chain on TypeScript, things are so different behind the scenes, like under the hood, it's so different. So I was like, ah, well, shit, sorry, boss. We have to move it to next week. Um, but I'm so confused why it's so different because of, um, because it's the same project. Like, um, yeah, so.

11:49 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, because Python has some libraries to support a kind of particular behavior. And also the lang chain is not fully effective unless you're using Node.js. There are some applications which will only run in a Node environment.

12:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Oh, I didn't know that.

12:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I had once a project where I had to read from a file. It was a project. I had to create a resume scanner, an ATS scanner. Reading from files with JavaScript. There's no built-in support for reading files by language in JavaScript.

12:26 - Jorge Lewis 
There is in Python, but not in JavaScript. Yeah, I prefer like now that I've worked with both, I prefer the Python one. It's a lot more the Pythonic way feels better. But yeah, when we're now that we're doing a TypeScript, it's a lot more lean, like our team is for each project, we only like to have two developers. So we get rid of all the distance between the API and the front end. So now we just have one project. So one, both developers are able to work very tight. And there's no like, difference between the database schemas, and we don't have to wait for all those things, because we had a lot of issues with that. So we're going to be able to move a lot faster with TypeScript. Hopefully, that's the idea. I sent you a friend request. Did you get it?

13:16 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes, I got it.

13:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right, let me invite you.

13:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So my co-founder Jonas, he's from Norway. He's been doing this. He's been programming for, we started around the same time, like six years ago.

13:40 - Jorge Lewis 
He's living in Chiang Mai right now. I'm just traveling around. So he's going to be in Thailand. Chiang Mai is in Thailand. So he's going to live in Thailand for maybe another eight months and then move to, I think, the Philippines.

13:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
Where do you live right now?

14:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Right now I live in Hong Kong but I've been traveling for the past three months and I'm not going to live in Hong Kong for a while. I'm going back to Hong Kong for like three days next week and then I'll be in the USA for a month and then Mexico for maybe a month and then maybe depends Japan or maybe in Europe.

14:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
So you move for the client projects?

14:32 - Jorge Lewis 
No, not specifically for the clients. Just more of, I love traveling. It's like going, like for me, a really nice work, work life is just, I come to work 10 hours and then for the other time, I just, I work out and then I travel around the city. It's really nice.

14:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

14:49 - Chinmay Pandya 
If only I could do that. Yeah, I mean, maybe, maybe.

14:53 - Jorge Lewis 
One of our team members, Nazif, he lives in Benin. We plan on him, if things continue to go well for the business, we plan on bringing him to Thailand and we'll have kind of an in-person office for a couple months. So if things go well between us as well, that's definitely an option. Is that something you're interested in or just, I mean, this is way in the future, but...

15:14 - Chinmay Pandya 
Sorry, your voice wasn't audible. Can you repeat what you said?

15:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, did you hear the first part about how we're planning to bring our other team member to Thailand or?

15:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Wait a second, just excuse me for a second. No worries, no worries.

15:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, sorry. This is actually my mom, she was trying to tell me something. All good, all good, don't worry man.

16:04 - Jorge Lewis 
When I'm back, if I go back home, you'll see a lot of that, just always my family were knocking.

16:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

16:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, I sent you an invite, by the way, to the Discord.

16:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I joined the group.

16:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, okay.

16:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Didn't, uh... Huh, it's not updating. There we go. Alright, so I gave you the staff role. You should be able to see all of the chats. I'm gonna add you to a three-way chat between you, me, and Jonas. One second.

17:05 - Jorge Lewis 
All right. I'm going to change your nickname on Discord to your real name. Yeah.

17:14 - Chinmay Pandya 
I don't know why I sent that user. It was a long time ago.

17:17 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, my one is, what's my one? My one is PoorHateGeorgia. It has my name. But, um... Oh, you're in the voice channel. All right, cool.

17:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Can you hear my voice on Discord or from the Meet?

17:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
Sorry?

17:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Are you speaking from Discord or from the Meet? The Meet, the Google Meet.

17:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

17:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
Should I mute in Discord?

17:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you don't need to go to the voice channel. You can leave it. And voice suddenly got louder. Okay, yeah, so I sent you, I believe, yeah, I also sent you invited to the super base.

18:09 - Jorge Lewis 
What else? Yeah, you're invited to the GitHub. Oh, let me send the environment files and all the resources.

18:33 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so what I sent was the issue in terms of what the behavior I was trying to get but was struggling a little bit with.

18:50 - Jorge Lewis 
And then here is the environment file. Yeah, just be careful with the OpenAI key.

19:03 - Jorge Lewis 
And then this is a link to the to where there's a couple resources for like the there's Google Slides there's a like a mine or a diagram for some of the things and the video meetings with the clients.

19:26 - Chinmay Pandya 
Where are you seeing this actually?

19:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, okay. Let me...

19:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see now? It's in a specific channel on Teams.

19:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I got it. Okay, cool.

19:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's the behavior at the top, the end file, and then the link is to a place where there's a bunch of links for all things. So you can understand the project through there. And then obviously the code will help.

19:58 - Jorge Lewis 
If there's anything that's missing or you think is more efficient, if we hop in a call and talk, then let me know.

20:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I guess I can go over the code a little bit, just like five minutes, just explaining what some of the things do.

20:23 - Chinmay Pandya 
Maybe save you some time.

20:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, that would be helpful.

20:30 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, let me know when you can see my screen.

20:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yep, it's visible.

20:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So you'll be able to find the Python projects or the Python code in the API folder in the source. So within here, there's only a couple main files. It's going to be main, assistant, check-in team, and state, and then utils probably. So these are really the main ones. The other ones are being used here and there, but don't worry too much. So you can take a look at the Python code to understand kind of the graph and how it should be working. And then when you're implementing it, it'll be in TypeScript. So that's in the web folder within here. So the main function or the main file is graph.ts. And this function is called by the API run graph.

21:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So yep, down here is what happens. You don't really need to, you don't need to return anything within this function. It's getting all updated to the database and we're listening to the database changes for new messages.

21:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah.

21:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, let's, let's dive into a little bit of the code. So within this main function, We're just, we're creating the graph. At the moment, like I said, it's just, okay, well now it's a little bit different, but there's just the supervisor and I was testing, trying to figure out how the tools work and trying to get that working. So feel free, completely free to modify all the code here to work. Go on your own branch and name it feature, feature, Chinmay, Chinmay, man.

22:22 - Chinmay Pandya 
Chinmay, it's like, it's an uh sound.

22:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, Chinmay.

22:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
Like that, Chinmay.

22:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Chinmay, Chinmay.

22:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, maybe it's the microphone. You can call me Chinmay, it's fine.

22:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, voice is lagging in between, but it's, yeah, it's fine if you call me Chinmay.

22:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to learn it, don't worry. Yeah, so I mean there's not much in terms of something new here, this is just very standard Lang graph. This is the state, we have just messages and then the next, this is where I was having a struggle with trying to make sure the flow was correct.

23:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and then the check-in team, this is just a module to pretty much separate it from the main code. This is to set up the check-in team. So I can draw a little graph to go over what the graph should look like in the end.

23:38 - Jorge Lewis 
So first we have...

23:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Sorry, you're lagging.

23:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:48 - Chinmay Pandya 
I said I use the same website. Oh yeah. This one's amazing.

23:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
Excalibur is the best.

23:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

23:57 - Jorge Lewis 
So at this top, there's the, what I, what we're calling the super router. Uh, so this guy's just the very top and then there's, he can select between going to just, or to like just a chatterbox, which is a placeholder for, for later down the road, we'll figure it out. But then the other option is the check-in team.

24:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, And then the check-in team within this, there'll be three people. There'll be the check-in supervisor, the coach, and then data analyst.

24:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have these three. I need to connect my mouse.

24:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so the flow of how it usually works is the data analyst or the check-in supervisor will request data. And then if the user gives the data, the check-in supervisor won't respond. He'll tell the coach, hey, the user has given us data, provide some coaching on it. The coach will say, all right, let's do that. But before that, he's going to ask the data analyst, hey, is there any data insights that we need or that you have for the user? So, for example, if the user in the past seven days has walked, let's say 30 minutes every day, but then today the user says, oh, I only walked five minutes today or 10 minutes. Then the data analyst will take a look at the long term and say, oh, hey, today was a lot lower than the past seven days. Let's tell the coach this. So the coach will be told that and the coach will say, okay, You the past seven days you've done this today was a bit slower. Why is that? How can we improve that and the coach will just help the the user try to fix the problem?

25:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean the don't worry too much about in terms of like the actual behavior of each of these guys Just more so getting it to work in the way that like the steps is how I described it in in the message Just Yeah, so it's just the user gives the data, the check-in updates, the supervisor updates the database, and then selects the coach. The coach will request data from the data analyst. If there is insights, then he returns it. If not, nothing happens. Then the coach will use that to make some response to coach the user. There are a couple examples that I'll find and send to you to hopefully give you an idea. But yeah, that's kind of the idea of what it's going to look like,

26:39 - Chinmay Pandya 
Any questions?

26:43 - Chinmay Pandya 
So which part of this behavior is not working like you wanted it to?

26:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe it was my lack of experience, but I was on the part where I was learning how to do this. Because in Python, I knew how to do it. But in TypeScript, when I was trying to implement this in TypeScript, I was like, okay, there's a bit of a difference in terms of how things are done. So I spent a little time learning, and then I figured out, okay, I can't do it the exact same way as Python. So I was exploring different ways to do it. None of them felt right, but that's just because I have no experience with the TypeScript one. So I was hoping that you could come up with a solution yourself and just see how it works. I haven't really tried a solution. One of the solutions that I was kind of brainstorming Don't take this as the answer, just as an idea, but I was trying to inherit the tool node, the default or the pre-built tool node. And also, instead of having it only return a new message, also return a parsed version of the output. So when you have a tool, it outputs a string. So for example, if we stringify an object like this, the next, then within this new tool node, we can parse it down and try to return it as the state so that it updates the state. That was kind of one of my solutions. But the reason I haven't done it yet is because I'm wondering why that isn't the default. So I'm wondering if I'm doing something fundamentally wrong. I don't know. That was kind of my issue where I've left off.

28:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
So the expected behavior is that when you pass in the data or whenever the user enters his activities, so the expected behavior is the end result from the coach about how he should be.

28:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me send an example. I have it somewhere.

29:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
I don't know where it is.

29:22 - Jorge Lewis 
By the way, do you have any friends that are doing programming as well? I'm just curious.

29:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, a lot of my friends are into this.

29:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Any of them into LangChain as well?

29:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
Not many use LangChain, but they are pretty familiar with the framework. They use Hugging Face and Lama Index and other frameworks.

29:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. That's cool. So you guys are all like big into AI now. Yeah.

29:59 - Jorge Lewis 
That's cool.

30:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Are all of you guys kind of doing things outside of school, like maybe internships or finding work or like own projects?

30:07 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, everybody is looking out for internships because in India, you cannot rely on your degree. Your what, sorry?

30:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
In India, it's like you cannot rely on your college degree unless you're from an IIT.

30:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So everybody has to be like, we have no choice.

30:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
Some people do it because they have no choice, but we do it because we like to gain skills and experience. Yeah.

30:36 - Jorge Lewis 
That's cool. That's really cool. It's super, super competitive, right? The whole scene in India with tech.

30:43 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, there's just too many too many people in the market. Yeah.

30:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah, we totally I don't know what happened to that conversation, but we're talking about traveling. I mean, I think you can hear me. So one of our team members, Nazif, he lives in Benin, in Africa. And he's been with us for about like six months, I think. And the plan is to, if the business keeps doing well, then we'll bring him to Thailand for a couple months. And we'll have like a like an in-person office for a couple months and see how that goes and just Get to meet each other and have fun. That's uh, so I was asking you if that's like something that would like to sound exciting or That does sound exciting In the future things go well, of course, but yeah Yeah, I've always wanted to do something of my own or be a part of a team I really want to build like a team that's like everyone's friends within the team and it's not like the normal agencies or the consultancies where it's just like everyone is kind of like a tool, it feels like at the bigger consultancies. So I want to feel like our team is very tight and everyone knows each other, we enjoy working together. And we're with each other for the long term. We don't have to work all together in the long term, but the idea is that we're growing together throughout the time that we're working together. If any of our team members has a better opportunity or more interesting opportunity somewhere else, that's something we hope for because whatever they find interesting is what we're happy with. Yeah, just growing with each other has become something we really enjoy. Like for me, I work like around 90 hours per week. I cannot do that if my team is like really annoying, like I can't. So it makes it so that I can continue working hard and enjoying what I do. So I sent an example chat, by the way. Is there anything I'm missing?

32:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, let me see.

33:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it is a chat application for daily check-ins and advisory purposes.

33:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't think it's too new, but the idea is that over time, the concept is not new for sure, but the client's a very big guy in tech. He's been in tech, IT, for like 15 years, but a couple years ago with his wife, he started doing life coaching, so they think this is a really good like a way to help their clients and to scale. On this note though, the clients for this project, his name is Kuhn. You'll see him in the videos of the meetings. He's very, very big for us. He's quite important because he has a very, very strong network and he'll be able to, if we perform well on these projects, he'll be able to bring us a lot of business from like higher paying clients. So that's kind of the goal. Just so you know.

34:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it's like a critical project you have here.

34:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah. Let me, I mean, yeah. Yeah, cool. You can search him up if you want. Cool. I think that should be it. Anything we haven't gone through?

34:41 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I just wanted to analyze the behavior of the individual components. You said there's a, there's a supervisor who requests data and the coach and an analyst.

34:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, but that will be the backend, right? That that's not what the, that's not visible to the user.

35:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for the for the user, it's for the user experience. What it's like is just talking to a life coach, one person, it's like, they want more data, you give them more data, they provide coaching, and then you say, Okay, cool.

35:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
So we analyze the individual components, if only an individual component is not behaving properly.

35:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Because it's all connected.

35:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, we haven't. What do you mean?

35:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
Like there's the three components for the you to get back and also you have to go through three components, right?

35:39 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, uh, does the entire system not behave as expected or one of the components?

35:46 - Jorge Lewis 
There is no system right now. The, the, um, the, our graph hasn't been made in, in TypeScript before. The only, the only line graph stuff currently is just the, um, It's just the sample stuff, like the supervisor, the researcher. And then I was testing with the tool guy. Um, our, if you want to see an implementation of our graph, our line graph, you can take a look at the Python code. That's where you'll find hopefully more useful stuff.

36:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

36:14 - Chinmay Pandya 
I would have to look at how it was used to work in Python. Then I'll try to figure out why. Are you like right now, are you more familiar with the Python or the type of the JavaScript or TypeScript one? I have used Python more actually. I've used Python more, but for, uh, uh, web application projects, of course I use TypeScript.

36:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Um, could you, I have terrible memory. Uh, things are moving too fast as well. Um, what's your, is what's your experience with, uh, Lang chain in TypeScript? Yeah.

36:58 - Chinmay Pandya 
So Lang chain in TypeScript, I do not have a professional experience like working for a company. I have experiences like where I have participated in competitive hackathons. Yeah. So there, uh, this, uh, this is, uh, your project, this project, it sounds very familiar to me because last year there was a hackathon where me and my team, uh, were, uh, working on a project where the user will enter in his daily schedule and, uh, the AI will support him with a fitness guideline for his entire week. Kind of a similar project there. I use Lang chain with JavaScript not TypeScript. Yeah, same thing. Yeah, just the type definition is the only change. Yeah, that should be fine.

37:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
I use Lang chain with JavaScript. Yeah.

37:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
And before that, I did an internship as a full stack web developer where I used Next.js and TypeScript.

38:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Next.js and TypeScript. Yeah, our project's using Stokke. The setup should be quite simple, just pnpmi, pnpmdev. If you set up the environment file, it shouldn't be an issue. You have access to Superbase, GitHub. I gave you my OpenAI key. Just change out the langsmith once for your one, just so you can debug.

38:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think that should be it. I'm heading to the gym now, so I'll be back in about an hour and a half. If you have any issues, text me and I'll be able to respond from my phone. If you have any issues, please text me because I'd much rather help you move faster than just you're trying to figure it out by yourself. Do not feel like you're bothering me at all because it's I enjoy helping people because in the same way you guys are helping us so yeah, and then Compensation just just to be totally honest. We're I'm gonna discuss it with my co-founder today Hopefully I can give you a response by today. If not tomorrow if that's cool with you Yeah, that's cool Thanks, man.

39:14 - Chinmay Pandya 
Sounds cool Take care. Have a good working on it and then it takes you and you think I face any issues. See you soon, man. Bye. Bye. See you soon""","Meet Meeting Transcript (32).txt"

1:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Uh, well.

1:28 - Eksno 
Oh, we were going over the code base and stuff. What do you want to go over that takes just 15 minutes?

1:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the code stuff.

1:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
That takes 15 minutes.

1:40 - Eksno 
At least I'll get to introduce myself.

3:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
New York.

3:02 - Jorge Lewis 
to speak or continue typing?

3:08 - Eksno 
I mean, OK, I sent what I had just because, yeah, expecting this call or him to junction.

3:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I have been doing the relations, but the project management, that's kind of over. So I need to, we need to transition things like that. And then also just the

3:28 - Eksno 
I mean, I've been doing the project management, so I don't know what you mean.

3:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, maybe then it's just I feel like I'm doing too much in terms of the management of the project. What do you mean? Yeah, I'm coding a majority of the project, but this feels like I'm managing way too much.

3:49 - Eksno 
Can you be specific at all or just in return?

3:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, let's let's like, is there? All right, we can chat about it after.

4:05 - Biwas bhandari 
Hello. Hello. How's it going?

4:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello, Jonas.

4:09 - Eksno 
Hello, Exxon. Hello.

4:11 - Eksno 
I'm Jonas. Yeah.

4:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Jonas. Yeah.

4:14 - Eksno 
I'm still on my personal Google account, which makes my name Exxon.

4:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:20 - Eksno 
Whenever I click a link, Google is kind of annoying with it. It like forces you to have a default account.

4:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Um, cool.

4:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so do you want to meet Jonas? Jonas is my co-founder. Uh, nice to meet you.

4:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

4:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, you want to introduce yourself Jonas? Say a little more?

4:39 - Eksno 
Yeah, sure. I was a software engineer, took like, what's it called? Locational or trade school in software engineering and then went into working for a software consultant. C for one and a half years. Afterwards I founded this company with Jorge during my employment.

5:04 - Eksno 
I've been doing software engineering since like ninth grade, got into programming very young and I've continued with it ever since.

5:16 - Biwas bhandari 
My name is Vivas Vandari and I've been in coding for around 2.5 years now. I started with web development. First I went and did some Python coding, and I switched to web development. And I've been doing it for around two years now. And I've been working with TypeScript for around nine months. And currently, I switched to Python for AI and machine learning. But now I'm into Android. Yep. Did you say nine or five?

5:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Nine. What's your experience with LangChain in TypeScript?

6:01 - Biwas bhandari 
So, I worked for a start-up at first, it was called NCI, and I have already told Jorge about that through blockchain. They just query their transaction, for example, just ask what is the transaction of my Bitcoin address, this is this, and they query through natural language, and the response comes.

6:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, so to go over the project a little bit. So this project is one of our clients projects and it's a life coaching bot. So it's supposed to help the users build habits. So mainly things like making sure they do a daily walk, making sure they're not eating too much and making sure they're watching a daily video. The app is super the chatbot that's going to help the user keep their habits, and then there's a LMS, so a learning management system, that's going to deliver a course on a daily basis to the user.

7:10 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so for the chat part, so initially we made it with Python in the back end and then connected it through an API. But the problem with that is we noticed we had too much unnecessary separation between our web and our API. So we decided to move it all into one, which made really easily using SvelteKit. So now our backend is in TypeScript and our frontend is also in TypeScript using SvelteKit. So it's all really nice and handy, but the problem is the TypeScript, I'm not familiar with the TypeScript SDK for LangChain myself. So I had a bit of an issue, bit of a few roadblocks trying to get it set up, but I figured this was a great way to kind of get you kind of doing like a, It's pretty much like an experiment to see how well we work together and how we like to work. We'll see around that.

8:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so I'm just going through the code right now. And you're using Superbase as a database, Langchain, Langgraph.

8:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

8:15 - Biwas bhandari 
Yep.

8:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

8:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, access to a database, the super base, like what should I just add him as a user?

8:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, I think so.

8:28 - Eksno 
Yeah. On the super base, uh, Adam to the team.

8:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

8:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So, uh, let me add you to the super base real quick and then we can go into the kind of the more technical aspects.

8:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Or let's go into the technical aspects first, actually. So the code is supposed to be using TypeScript. There's a couple, I believe I invited you to the server, right? Yeah. I'm going to, I think what I'm going to do is send you a couple of the calls we had with the client. So you can, first of all, see what he looks like, see how he talks, and also understand the project.

9:19 - Jorge Lewis 
And then I can explain it briefly right now, kind of the Lang chain aspect of it. So the main thing is there's a main router that will route to either a check-in team or just a normal chatting bot. The check-in team is responsible for doing a check-in, a daily check-in. A check-in is pretty much where the bot will ask for information and the user should be like, how many minutes did you walk today? How many calories did you eat? Things like this. And that's a daily process that the user has to go through every day. And the bot's job is to make sure the user fills it in, and then also to provide coaching on it. So the way the loop looks like is the user says, all right, let's start a check-in. And the bot says, OK, cool. How many minutes did you walk today? And the user says, I walked 30 minutes. The bot will say, great. That's 10 minutes more than you walked yesterday, or something regarding that. So some feedback for coaching. Let me pull up a graph explaining or depicting the architecture.

10:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't think I can send a graph in the chat. I'm going to send it in Discord. So you see there? Let me know when you guys have it open.

10:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So it starts from the bottom. At the very bottom, there's the main router, and this guy pretty much checks if the user is asking to start a check-in. That's really the main job. If the user is doing a check-in, then the check-in team will be in charge of the process. The check-in team consists of three guys. Don't worry about the names here, but listen to my voice. So three guys. So the check-in supervisor, the coach, and the data analyst. The supervisor is in charge of gathering the data and then requesting new data and calling tools to update the database and things like that. The coach is in charge of providing coaching to the user. So following the prompt we give the coach bot to give coaching. So things like, oh, great job, but last time you could have done a little bit better, blah, blah, blah. The data analyst is what the coach will use to gather further insights. So things like trends, or patterns that the data analyst can see throughout a longer period of time. So how it will look is the check-in assistant or the check-in supervisor will ask for new data, the user will give new data, and then the coach will respond saying, oh, great job. And he'll ask the data analyst, hey, is there any further insights we can use? And the data analyst will give the coach some further ones or not. But on the surface, all of them act as the same bots. They're all going to look like the same person. So the idea is that the bot is a life coach that can help the user.

12:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's a pretty good explanation of how things are working so far. Any questions? Anything I missed?

12:29 - Biwas bhandari 
For technical, your coding part, Okay, I think that's it. I will start working here.

12:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So for the current state of the project, I can go into that a little bit. The project is under the migration I've done. I would say About 70% of the migration, all of the main files are in there, are in the web project, but they're just not working yet. They're not connected. The Python files are attached somewhere in the project. I can also send the zip file if they're not.

13:24 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, the things that I had trouble with where I left off was I was trying to figure out how tool calling could work to select the next speaker. So for example, In the Python one, it was really easy. The user would send a message giving some data, like, I walked 30 minutes today. The check-in LLM would say, OK, he would call the tool to update the database. And then he would call the tool to select the next speaker, which would directly bring it to the coach. And the coach would respond. So it would look like the user's message, then the coach's message. And then the coach provides this message, and then, yeah. So I had trouble having a tool called modify the states. That's where it didn't work out so well Yeah So I'll send some I'll send the videos regarding the project to make sure you're fully up-to-date And then I'll also try to find and send all the resources regarding the project

14:20 - Biwas bhandari 
to make sure you kind of understand it more Yeah, any any questions Just so you know, I don't have access to GPT-4 API key.

14:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, let me send you the environment variables. I'll send all that and all your resources in our chat together.

14:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so I'm not finished checking all the codes. Whenever I will find some dilemma, I will text you.

14:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sounds good, for sure.

14:58 - Jorge Lewis 
If any problem at all, let me know, because I'd rather help you move faster than you wondering about some of the code. So anything, don't feel like you're bothering me, please do.

15:08 - Biwas bhandari 
So OK, today I will take the codes and set up my code workspace and try to run it. And I will start working it from tomorrow. Or if it's urgent, I can start working it today.

15:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sounds good. Yeah, so just once again, if you have any questions, please let me know. And also, in terms of updates, if you can give me quite a few updates throughout the day, how things are going, that'll be great. Those small things are really helpful. Yeah.

15:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks so much, man.

15:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's see how this turns out. And best of luck.

15:45 - Biwas bhandari 
So when is the deadline of this project?

15:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So the deadline, so I told the clients that the project would be migrated from Python to TypeScript by next Wednesday. So we have six days. Me and two other developers that were currently in the hiring process as well are also going to be working on this. So you three are, we're all doing the same thing really. So in a couple of days, we'll see who's made the best, we'll come together and we'll figure out the best way to move forward.

16:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So, yeah.

16:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

16:26 - Biwas bhandari 
I think that's it. You can send the videos of the client and environment variables and give access to the database.

16:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep, sounds good. Perfect.

16:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

16:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
You're Nepal, right?

16:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

16:46 - Jorge Lewis 
What time is it?

16:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it 3 p.m. Or 2 p.m.? It's 5 p.m., yes.

16:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Huh?

16:54 - Biwas bhandari 
4.39 p.m.

16:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Huh. So yeah, we're at 6 p.m. Right now.

17:03 - Eksno 
Well, finally working with someone on a roughly equal time.

17:11 - Eksno 
That's going to be interesting.

17:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have anything to add, Jonas? I don't know.

17:18 - Eksno 
Just good luck. There's a lot of TypeScript.

17:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

17:23 - Jorge Lewis 
If you have any questions regarding how it connects to the SvelteKit, let me know.

17:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, do be aware the TypeScript code isn't the best. The TypeScript code is okay. It's okay. Jonas has fixed it up. But the Python one, that one is painful to see.

17:44 - Jorge Lewis 
And also in case it wasn't obvious just don't share any of the code. This is confidential. It's just us.

17:55 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, the basic stuff.

17:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. Cool. Okay. Thanks man.

17:59 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Okay. Yes, that's it. I'll just start working right now.

18:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
I'm currently free.

18:08 - Biwas bhandari 
You can send the videos and yeah, we'll do.

18:12 - Biwas bhandari 
I'll send all the resources in our chat.

18:14 - Biwas bhandari 
When I'll have any problem, I'll just text you.

18:18 - Biwas bhandari 
Perfect, man. All right. I'll see you around.

18:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
See you around.

18:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Have a good day. Bye bye.

18:23 - Eksno

Yeah, I can hear you fine, yeah. Okay, great.

2:54 - Wassay Shaikh 
So how are you doing, bro?

2:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, good. I'm super stressed, man. I've spent the entire day today trying to get this to work. But I only started learning the TypeScript SDK like yesterday, so having a lot of trouble.

3:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Our clients is in quite a rush. We told him it would be done today, but we're gonna have to tell him Hey, we weren't able to get it done. So So yeah a bit of a bit of a not so good situation, but you know, I see I can understand So what I can do for you guys Yeah, so, okay. So obviously I don't want you to do this unpaid so I think we'll do is I could we could maybe pay for a The, I think it'll probably take you. So your experience with line chain, right? We're in TypeScript.

Um, yeah, because for me, for me, I used Python for, for the time I've used like chain, but TypeScript is quite different in the way it works. So I've had a lot of trouble myself. So, um, Uh, Jorge, can I ask you one question?

4:17 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah. Uh, what is the exact reason behind migrating from Python to TypeScript? Like, Anything?

4:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so for us, for working with Python, it was too much of a, the gap was too big between our front end team and our back end team. And we always had to interact through the API and the database. It was always disconnecting us. So by working with TypeScript, we're able to be a lot faster in terms of everyday development, but getting started is going to be a bit harder because there's less documentation and we're not used to it. I'm not used to it yet, so.

4:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

4:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Makes sense.

4:58 - Wassay Shaikh 
Totally makes sense. So, uh, okay. Uh, well, I can try my best to, uh, migrate from Python to TypeScript because I understand it. Uh, and mostly the error we get in a TypeScript is related to type safety because it's, it's JavaScript basically with just some extra type. Oh, I mean, wait, wait. So you have experience with Lang chain and JavaScript or no, like not Javascript but you can say the TypeScript because I have tried with TypeScript but not too much just the basic things like calling OpenAI and I haven't even tried RAG on the TypeScript but just to test it that's why I didn't even consider that my TypeScript is very strong with in-line chain but yeah I understand it Okay.

5:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So for us, since we're so tight, I don't know if you'll be able to, I mean, it's not, I thought it was going to be easy to learn the TypeScript version, but it wasn't.

6:10 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'll let, I'll, I'll let you have a go at it, but cause I thought you had experience with TypeScript in LinkedIn. So I'll let you, I'll let you have a go at it. I'll describe the problem to you and I'll go through the project, but There isn't much I want to compensate for it. Is that alright with you?

6:31 - Wassay Shaikh 
Well, money is not really a problem here. I'm good without it, even without it. But you can pay me whatever you want, if you want. Otherwise, it's good. We can take it as a test, you can say.

6:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's funny because we were actually going to have a technical interview doing something similar, but this is going to be live, so now there's pressure.

6:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, okay.

6:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Um, okay.

6:57 - Jorge Lewis 
So the project is on a repository. Um, let me, um, because it uses super base and everything. So have you, have you used super base before?

7:12 - Wassay Shaikh 
Uh, I, I have tried super base before because it's, it's mainly a postgres, uh, under the hood and yeah. So my main go-to database is also Postgres, that's why. I've searched about it and get to know about it a lot related to Superbase.

7:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right, can you send me your email? It's awasi.

7:47 - Jorge Lewis 
May I type it here?

7:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, go ahead and type it.

8:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to give you access to the Superbase table, the Superbase project, and then I'll also add you to the GitHub repository.

8:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Just so you know, don't share the code. Don't worry about it. Just had to mention it.

8:36 - Wassay Shaikh 
I will forget about it once the job is done.

8:44 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, I have received the email.

8:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me quickly All right, I give you access to the...

9:37 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, I have received the email. I was just joining the organization.

10:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, I'm in.

10:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm having trouble adding you to the GitHub.

10:28 - Wassay Shaikh 
I'm in the Super Beast, I have the access right now.

10:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, to the GitHub though. Okay. All right, for the...

10:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes?

10:52 - Jorge Lewis 
For the GitHub, it seems like we can't add extra members.

11:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I can clone it and then send that to you.

11:07 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, that will also work.

11:47 - Jorge Lewis 
What time is it for you right now?

11:50 - Wassay Shaikh 
I guess. Yeah, it's 10.30 PM.

11:59 - Wassay Shaikh 
You're also, you're in Thailand right now.

12:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

12:03 - Wassay Shaikh 
For me, it's 12, around You're not enjoying the nightlife in Thailand? Some days, some days.

12:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Tonight's a busy night.

12:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Buzz buzz.

13:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm struggling here. Hold up. Sorry about that. That.

13:41 - Wassay Shaikh 
No ways.

14:12 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I'm going to have to send it to you through email. I sent you just the files.

14:23 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, yeah.

15:04 - Wassay Shaikh 
Did you get the zip?

15:07 - Wassay Shaikh 
Not. Till now, I was continuously refreshing it.

15:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I think I got a notification saying it didn't go through. Let me try again.

15:18 - Wassay Shaikh 
No worries.

15:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you double check your emails are typed correctly? Yeah, it is.

16:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me know if you get it because it didn't work the first time, I don't know.

16:07 - Wassay Shaikh 
Okay.

16:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's getting rejected every time, I don't know.

16:30 - Wassay Shaikh 
Is there any other option so that you can share with me?

16:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I think probably maybe LinkedIn.

16:41 - Wassay Shaikh 
Will LinkedIn work? Let's try. If it works.

16:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, it does.

16:47 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, I have received.

16:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
It'll be cool.

16:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me send you the environment files. Do you have Discord, by the way?

17:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
I have Discord.

17:00 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, I have Discord. Yep.

17:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Could you send me your username?

17:05 - Wassay Shaikh 
Let me share it with you.

17:26 - Wassay Shaikh 
I have sent it in a chat.

17:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

17:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, where have you sent it? Oh, in the, okay, I see.

17:47 - Wassay Shaikh 
In the meantime, I will quickly move the folder to the private folder or a separate folder, sorry.

18:04 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I sent you a friend request.

18:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Let me check.

18:12 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah.

18:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Accepted.

18:16 - Wassay Shaikh 
Cool.

18:42 - Jorge Lewis 
are essentially the environment keys. That's my API key, by the way, so just be careful for the OpenAI one. You can change the Langsmith API keys as well for yourself.

18:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

19:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so in that, what I sent you should also be the Python code.

19:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Python?

19:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so the old Python code is...

19:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Is there as well?

19:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

19:15 - Wassay Shaikh 
I was actually extracting the file. And once it gets extracted, I will open it. Then we will go through the overview. Then I will start working on it.

19:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sounds good. OK.

19:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I have it.

19:39 - Wassay Shaikh 
Is that core code is in the admin?

19:44 - Jorge Lewis 
core code, oh the core code is in web, is in web source. Web, okay.

19:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Which web frameworks have you used again?

20:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, which?

20:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Which web frameworks?

20:11 - Wassay Shaikh 
Sorry, I didn't understand what you said.

20:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Web Frameworks. Web Frameworks.

20:17 - Wassay Shaikh 
Web. I'm familiar with Next.js for the front-end and FastAPI for the back-end. Okay, so I have your code open in my VS Code.

21:04 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, let me know. Maybe you can screen share and I can, we can run through it.

21:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I was trying to locate the Python code here So the Python is in is an API Where's your API folder Let me send you the Python code separately because the zip was from alpha and the Python code

22:09 - Jorge Lewis 
is not in alpha.

22:11 - Jorge Lewis 
My bad. No problem, no problem.

23:18 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm gonna send oh, are you get this good on your laptop or no?

23:24 - Wassay Shaikh 
Sorry, do you have discord on your laptop? No, I I haven't logged in in the laptop yet was on memory Alright, let me send it on LinkedIn then. Alright, sent it.

25:00 - Wassay Shaikh 
Okay, yeah, I have opened your second code.

25:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so it's not, I'm not gonna lie, it's not the best code. That was like like kind of a prototype, we're still learning with it. The main one is main. The function we're calling is run graph, I believe it's later further down.

25:23 - Jorge Lewis 
You're familiar with Python code, right? Yeah, yeah.

25:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So how about we...

25:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I'll run through the kind of what the project is and hopefully that'll give you like a high-level view and then you can see So the project is supposed to be a life coach. It's a bot that's going to help the user every day keep with their habits. So there's a functionality for this called a check-in, which is going to be every day the bot is going to do a check-in with the user. The bot's going to gather some information, like how long did you walk today? Have you watched the informational piece? Along with the chatbot aspect of this app, there's an LMS. Do you know what an LMS is?

26:18 - Wassay Shaikh 
A learning management system, if I'm not wrong.

26:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

26:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's a course connected to this app as well. So the bot is going to ask, oh, did you watch the video today? Daily video. It'll ask, what did you eat today? Or things like this. You can check through the code what type of variables there.

26:39 - Jorge Lewis 
And the architecture we're kind of using is a multi-agent design, but they all act as the same bot. So we pretty much tell them, hey, you guys are all working together to help the user. Your specialty is blah, blah, right?

27:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah.

27:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Anything I'm missing, anything obvious I'm missing?

27:13 - Wassay Shaikh 
Well, it's honestly a great overview. I would say, but it will help me a lot if you tell me about the files. Just give me the basic overview about each file. What are the main purpose of this? Like the main.py, it's definitely the major file here because it have the line graph set up here. I can see it. The state and everything else, but okay. Yeah. Okay.

27:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's start from, let's start from assistant, just the top. Okay. Um, this, this file is, is just a class for the assistant, just really a helper function to make it all, uh, sweet and simple. You're probably familiar with this one. This is, uh, just, it's a role, uh, runnable where they just it calls the call function and it runs. Anything special here is, let me think, nothing really too special. There's some few-shot prompting at the bottom near the middle there, line 35, but that's about it. You don't have to worry too much about that. Actually, don't worry about it at all. So the check-in team is just a module of the graph.

28:30 - Wassay Shaikh 
Have you worked with line graph before by the way, I haven't asked Yeah, I have like work with language because I basically clone some Projects with my own requirements. But yeah, I Have a deeper understanding related to line graph How does state node and edges work?

28:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Google So yeah, so this one is just the team the check-in team. Let me let me draw so the I'll describe the layers how they have how we have it so far, so the top one is a we have the router. This guy determines should we start a check in? Or should we just chat with the user? You can see this in in main. Take a look at main.py.

29:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have. In the main function.

29:24 - Wassay Shaikh 
That's not.

29:28 - Wassay Shaikh 
I was actually trying to look it from the import file, but OK, no worries.

29:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

29:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So here.

29:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
How about how about I go through?

29:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me let me screen share my screen.

29:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect. Alright, are you able to see? Yeah, I can. All right, cool.

30:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so we'll start with the high level. So the top layer is the supervisor. We call him the super supervisor. And he determines, should we start the check-in or should we just chat with the user?

30:20 - Jorge Lewis 
which we call the chatterbox. The chatterbox is going to be replaced later, excuse me, with just other things. But for now, we've just had it as a placeholder so that we can implement the super supervisor.

30:33 - Jorge Lewis 
This guy is very simple, just a normal agent with a route to next speaker tool. Oh, wait, no. Select next speaker, so it just determines the next speaker.

30:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I won't go too deep into this because it'll it'll take way too long. So this is the main guy Then Yeah, so if the user wants to start a check-in, the super supervisor will route to this team.

31:14 - Jorge Lewis 
This team consists of these three guys. So the supervisor of this team, the coach, and the data analyst. Data analyst is currently placeholder.

31:25 - Jorge Lewis 
His prompt is literally like, just make information up. But this is the team structure. The supervisor is the one with the tools to update the database, update the check-in on the database. So I can show you what it kind of looks like,

32:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so here's a check-in and it has these different variables. These will change over time, but don't worry about that right now. So we've got moving, so how much the users moved today, how far they walked today, calories, blah, blah, blah. So just the checkup, right? Daily thing.

32:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the coach is just to provide some guidance. So it'll be like, oh, how to improve if they failed something, for example. And the data analyst will be what the coach will call on the data analyst to provide some deeper insights. It'll analyze the data in a much more complex way.

32:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, so that's it. We've made it quite tight. There's a lot of normal stuff here that connects the graph.

32:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, so the user can stop the check-in if they really want to. At the start of the process, they fetch today's check-in if the user has already started it, and then updates with any new data that the user gives. So that's the check-in team.

33:15 - Jorge Lewis 
The state is quite simple. I mean, this isn't even used, so I could probably delete it, but we have the main thing, which is the messages that stand there, and then next. Profile shouldn't even be here as well, to be honest. The main thing is messages and next. Next just determines who's speaking next in the sequence.

33:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yeah, that's, that's pretty much the way that we add the team, by the way, is using, uh, we, we pipe them together. So we have the initial builder. Uh, we add the cheddar box on a week. We add the check-in team first to the builder. Um, and then we add the cheddar box to the builder and then the super supervisor. Um, we load the events from the database and then we format them here.

34:08 - Jorge Lewis 
And then here, this is just a simple check. If the user is already checking in, then we're just going to start with the check-in supervisor instead of the super supervisor.

34:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

34:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

34:23 - Jorge Lewis 
And then handle new events just allows us to upload it to the database. Yeah, it just does some checking and uploads it to the database.

34:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so that's the Python. Let me go through, is it all good so far?

34:42 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, it makes sense.

34:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Those were kind of the only files you needed to know. I think everything else is useless. Yeah, so really only look at main, assistant, check-in team, and state. If anything else is referencing another file, then it's useful, but otherwise, don't worry. There's probably a lot of unused imports, by the way.

35:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
No problem, no problem.

35:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so for the web part, the code is inside here. So it's web, source, lib, and then server, AI.

35:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

35:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is where the code lives. Inside here, we just have a couple agents that I'm playing around with.

35:34 - Jorge Lewis 
So the main file is just graph.ts and this function here, this main function.

35:40 - Wassay Shaikh 
Your screen is stopped. It was not sharing anymore.

35:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me fix that.

35:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, there we go.

35:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, perfect. So graph is the main file here. This is the function that gets called by the API on Svelte's side. So yep, with just the user message and the profile ID. TypeScript or the JavaScript version of Langtrain uses quite a bit of different naming schemes. So for example, the builder is workflow here.

36:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Currently how the web part of the project is looking so far is I was still trying to figure out how to make things work. We still haven't imported the actual graph. So I was trying to test with, the problem I was having was really with tool calling and getting it to pass, getting it to pass it to the next agent properly. So that was a bit of an issue I had.

36:56 - Wassay Shaikh 
Is your Python backend or Python agent is connected to a frontend right now? If you can show me the exact flow on the frontend, if it's connected and working right now.

37:07 - Jorge Lewis 
It's not currently connected, but I have an example.

37:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, perfect.

37:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Here's kind of a graph to maybe help understand a little bit. So the main supervisor, if the user wants to start a check-in, it'll go to the check-in supervisor. And then the check-in supervisor will just have a loop with these two other agents until all the data is filled in. So the check-in assistants will ask for new data. The user will give new data. The coach will say, OK, you've done a good job, but you could do better like this. And for every time there's new data, the data analyst will check, hey, is there anything out of the ordinary? Is there any pattern that we can help notify the coach of And then the coach will use that data. So this is kind of a small loop.

38:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Well, that's great.

38:12 - Wassay Shaikh 
If you could share this flowchart with me, it will definitely be helpful.

38:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'll send everything your way. I'll send it on Discord, so you should probably get Discord on your computer.

38:25 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, I will definitely download it right now.

38:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe I think I'll send the... I'll try to find... Oh, here it is.

38:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is kind of an example of one of the conversations that was working with the Python API. So let's check in. Great. Let's start with one step at a time. How did you move? How many minutes did you spend moving? And then the user gives the number. And behind the scenes right here, so like before the assistant gives a response, he updates the database, he calls the tool. And then I pretend like I forgot to give some info, and then the assistant updates it again. You have to note down, he updated the total minutes, so 20 minutes plus 80 minutes.

39:30 - Jorge Lewis 
And then I just gave more info, he said, okay, cool, that's a bit low. So this is the coaching bit, and then continue to ask for more data, and then it's just that loop.

39:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Perfect.

39:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the current, wow.

39:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

39:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, there's other, this is kind of the example that I think you should be going off of Maybe the cycle that I sent, that I had a picture of earlier is kind of a good way to just visualize it.

40:04 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah.

40:06 - Wassay Shaikh 
I think you did a great job. You explained it in a best way. And I guess I figured out most of the things. And now just the part remaining is I have to start working on it, I believe.

40:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Google, if you have any questions, man, do let me know. For sure. If I can help you move faster, that'll be even better. So don't think you're bothering me when you ask a question. For sure, for sure.

40:37 - Wassay Shaikh 
I will ping you if I get stuck anywhere. Definitely, I will ping you.

40:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, cool.

40:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, OK. Sounds good.

40:49 - Jorge Lewis 
If there's anything else, once you get started on the project and you have any straightaway questions, let me know. Maybe I think a good step would be getting started setting up the web server. You've set it up. You've used PMPM before, right?

41:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

41:07 - Wassay Shaikh 
Actually, I've used NPM and for the web server, I've used PM2 manager. If you heard about it, it's for the production environment.

41:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

41:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, if you go into the web folder, then you just run those two commands and you should be set up.

41:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect. Yeah.

41:30 - Jorge Lewis 
If there's any errors, let me know. The errors will probably be related to the environment files, so let me know.

41:38 - Wassay Shaikh 
for you for sure so perfect it it makes sense yeah I will I will get back to you once I get things done or before if if I get stuck somewhere yeah perfect all right cool thanks so much for

41:52 - Jorge Lewis 
saying um keep me updated I think if Like for me, one of the things I struggled a lot with when starting out with doing consulting was expectation management. So keeping me updated every few hours would be good. Even if you're having any troubles, letting me know of that would be good so I can know. For sure, for sure. Other than that, yeah, it'll be exciting to see what we're able to pull out because you don't have any experience with TypeScript, BlankChain before. So let's see. A lot of new stuff you're gonna have to learn.

42:26 - Wassay Shaikh 
Yeah, and I honestly love to push the boundaries because that's what the developers do. All they have to do is search the Google mostly. So definitely that's what I'm going to do for the next couple of hours. So let's see where we end up. It will be exciting.

42:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect. All right, man.

42:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Take care. And thanks so much. Yeah, by the way, we'll for sure, if you're able to kind of pull something out of this and you're able to make something work, we'll definitely compensate you. And yeah, kind of treat it as a test, as an interview. Take our project. Perfect. Again, thank you very much.

43:03 - Wassay Shaikh 
Let's begin and see you. Bye-bye. All right.

43:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
See you, Wassay.

43:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Take care, man.

0:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hello?

0:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you hear me?

0:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can't hear you.

0:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
There he is.

0:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you hear me, JP?

0:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can hear you.

0:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
How about now? I just can't help. Jorge, can we hear you?

0:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you hear me now?

0:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but your audio is massively delayed to your video.

0:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me refresh my page.

0:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
I'm watching a bad lip-sync film.

1:00 - Jonathan Phillips 
How about now?

1:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect. Cool.

1:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, yeah, I just felt it was useful if the three of us can get aligned on where we are with things. There's obviously, you know, there's stuff going on our side that you're not aware of There's stuff going on your side that we're not aware of And I just want to make sure that we're aligned and having more conversations.

1:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Obviously, you know, we're, by nature, impatient. We're super excited about what's coming, and we want to start getting using it and selling it, and also managing our own expectations about what this actually can really do versus what we think it can do. There was a question I had from Arif this morning, which was, you know, is there a way that we could prioritize IntelliAgent to rather than adapt in order to move IntelliAgent along further, quicker, because that probably is something that could start to sell sooner. But from my understanding, and this is more of a question is, they're sort of one of the same thing. And then if they are sort of one of the same thing, and the only thing that's different is the training, Should we just merge them into a single project rather than you having two different stakeholders? And actually what's variable is the training, not the, I mean, yeah, when we get into the LMS stuff, I don't know, actually, maybe your solution, JP, will need an LMS type thing as well.

2:33 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I think we've got a blank canvas at the moment, and I think we can work out a way of working together would be cool. I mean, I don't know, technically, is it the same structure we're looking at?

2:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So in terms of merging the projects, are we talking as in code-wise? So in terms of the code, it's probably better to keep them separate just because there is overlap. Can you guys hear me?

3:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

3:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

3:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, Jonas is here.

3:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, Jonas. Hey, Jonas.

3:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey.

3:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, the way I sort of see this, I think there's a unified code base, but then there's an instance. So for example, if I do the GCSE instance, it's just a new instance of the code base that I would train to be a GCSE bot as opposed to a health coaching bot or JP.

3:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Not really, there's a lot more moving parts than that. We could commoditize it, we could make it in a way so...

3:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's amazing how much these programs stop at really, really brilliant words and sentences.

3:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, he's there.

4:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
We've lost you.

4:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Are you both in the same country still, or are you different countries now?

4:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
You've got no mutes, you've lost power.

4:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hello?

4:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, you're back.

4:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Someone's ringing. No clue who that was.

4:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, yeah, so we had the ideas of, so line graph is made in a way to be graphical. So therefore, we could try, we had the idea of converting the code. Instead of coding a graph, you use a UI to make the graph. And that way you'd give non-technical people the ability to make their own graphs. You'd have to give them the ability to make new tools, connect the different edges, what scenarios should, or what conditions should the edges conform to, things like this. That's an idea we had. But it goes way beyond what we're trying to do with just either of these two projects.

5:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so just going back to the moving parts. So there's more moving parts than just saying, this is the system that we're doing. It's more than just an instance of the system, because the graphs are different.

5:25 - Jorge Lewis 
The biggest difference is probably just how the graphs are made. JP's graph is going to be, I think, I think the design pattern is called collaborative. Did someone leave? Arif is here. Arif.

5:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

5:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you guys hear me now? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Nice.

5:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So JP's graph is a lot more collaborative. The agents are working together to solve a task. A dApps one, they're a lot more behind the scenes, just accomplishing their task and then moving on.

6:11 - Jorge Lewis 
In terms of perception, we can prompt them to act like one or multiple people, but behind the scenes, they are also very different in terms of the code.

6:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is there a way that we could make them the same so that we're building one solution to benefit us both as opposed to you guys building two parallel paths?

6:28 - Jorge Lewis 
We'd like to think that we're not totally redoing everything, because a lot of the things we're able to reuse. So for example, of course, all the knowledge we learned, the experience, of course that. But then things like how we organize and format the entire project. So for example, we learned the best way to create a class of an agent is with these properties, these functions, and those things. So we're able to reuse a lot of those things. But in terms of the actual graphs themselves, so that's something that we don't want to try to merge. Trying to merge them would introduce a lot more problems, then it would probably solve, especially at this early in the stage.

7:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
So can you just give us sort of like a 10,000 view of the roadmap of where we are in ADAPT? When do you fork that and start making progress? Because in my head, you've got a certain number of hours in your team. If you're working on both IntelliAgent and ADAPT, or just on one of them, You can't, we can't be making as much speed on both is if you're only working on what does my head can't compute that. So, like, are we at a point now where we've done enough of adapt that there's a fork to Intelli agent. What if we put everybody on a teleagent? Would that get us there quicker? How long should we sort of pause, adapt? So I just want to talk at this high level to see what's going, because I think one of the beliefs is that we want to unlock JP so he can get on and do his stuff. Yes, that means pausing, adapt, but that's something that we'll take into consideration.

7:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, so ADAPT, the first thing that I was working on ADAPT was the AI graph part, which is the same part that Story will have. So right now we're at a point in ADAPT where most of the things we're going to start working on are not going to be purely the AI aspect, but more of integrating ADAPT specific things. So things like allowing for the onboarding, very specific things to ADAPT.

8:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Kevin, have you explained to JP or Arif how we're planning to move our entire code base, or our API?

8:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, thank you.

8:34 - Jorge Lewis 
So pretty much we wrote all the AI stuff in Python, and we're interacting with it through an API. The problem is that it's not the most efficient way to do it. What we're going to do now is switch it to, we're going to move all the code to our web project. That way, all the code is done through the web project. We don't have to interact with an API. It's all done with the web project and the database. There's only two moving parts. So we get rid of the entire thing of the API, which was causing a lot of issues. So now we're a lot more lean.

9:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So with that said, after that's done, that'll be a good point to fork, adapt, and story. We've already started designing the the way we want to move forward with the first graph for story.

9:20 - Jorge Lewis 
It's, I think, let me check.

9:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Nope, that graph is not going to help. But it's the way story is going to look is each, so there's going to be one main leader of the team. And it's going to really mimic a workshop where if people, if someone has something to say, they can say it. That's the idea. Everyone's going to have an option to speak.

9:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, I'm sorry, I'm diving in too deep. Let's stay here. At the 10,000 feet level. Yes, I think probably by next week we'll be looking to diverge from ADAPT's AI bits into Stories and Startups.

10:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let's just pause here for a second. I think we're going into, I don't think we need to care right now about the technical implementation. Let's talk about this as a high-level feature set. So as ADAPT, there are main components around a coaching bot, onboarding, the LMS, stuff like that.

10:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
The IntelliAgent, which is the new name for Story, is a workshop capability solution. So you have multiple workshops. I don't know, JP, whether you've done any sort of high-level UX flow or high-level feature set because that's where I'm concerned is given the...

10:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
And listen, there's always going to be gaps and bumps in any software delivery project. This is not a criticism. It's just an observation. We've spent a huge amount of time getting aligned on Adapt, and there's still been gaps, right? You know, they're unavoidable. I'm not, I don't know whether the same level of details gone into IntelliAgent and therefore you've got JP as your customer who's massively excited and dreaming about everything that's possible and what he's going to get. You guys are busy on Adapt and saying, yeah, yeah, you can have that. I don't know if we're all speaking on the same language or the same level of granularity and being very specific. You are getting this, you will not get that. So JP, I don't know whether you've even got an entire UX or a page flow or anything like that to say, OK, so this is the complexity. We're talking just about really low-level role capability, as in, I want to be able to run a workshop. Actually, running a workshop inside lots of other stuff suddenly could introduce a whole level of complexity. Is this an iPhone app? Is this not an app? Is this just websites? Is there a mobile companion? That whole side of it.

11:55 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think we've moved on really from where we started. So originally there was a proof of concept which we were looking at the viability of several bots talking to each other and working to a solution. I think that was the original sort of proof of concept. I think even since we came up with that idea We've seen how the industry's moved on. So we know that other people are doing this already, technically, and they're not necessarily commercialized it just yet, but they're talking about how they're going to commercialize it and ready to go with it. So I think the proof of concept is, is not necessarily anymore. Will it work? I think it's, how will it work for us? Because I think the industry saying it will work without a doubt, and you can commercialize it. So the way that I see my platform working is just very much training multiple bots all with different areas of expertise to take the user through a journey, a framework that we devise from the beginning to the end. So they have all intelligence trained into them to ask the user the right questions at the beginning and then to take them on the journey little by little and keeping them on the path so that they end up with a complete and holistic idea of what they want to do with their business. So I think that the training of the bots is key. I don't think we need to code the framework itself because that's inherent within the bots and their behavior.

13:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
What's the actual interface of that? So you've got the capability, but actually, yeah, and this could just be my ignorance. So if you feel you've got it, I'm happy to sort of leave it and be satisfied later. But I'm just not clear of what that actually looks like because Does that make sense? There's a raw capability of bots talking to bots and doing something. But what does the actual customer interact with? The screens, the flow, the buttons? Because some of those things can suddenly start having a material impact on effort. Even though it's just like two words out of our mouth, that could be two weeks worth of work.

14:09 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, ultimately, at its raw level, you just need an interface, a text interface, like you have now with ChatGPT, where you start talking and asking questions. The facilitator bot will start with a conversation and then bring in the other bots when necessary.

14:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is just chat, there is no web interface at all?

14:31 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well, with the web interface, you can make it as pretty, as functional as you want, but at a raw level, functionality wise, you just need to be able to interact with the bots. So that's where we need to start with as far as this is a MVP, but obviously we we can build up so many other interactions with it, for example, APIs into other tools, and then you start to complicate it. But in its raw sense, where we want to get to first of all, it's just basically integration with bots, having conversations and getting to a conclusion.

15:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, I mean, in order to do that, you're going to have to need quite an extensive admin configuration console to Well, two levels of admin. One is the training experience so that it's doing what you want it to do. But then there's the instance that someone might use version as well. And I think just having a chat thing, like how does a story framework come to life? Or is that just something in the background? There's all sorts of the productization of this to a usable interface, like maybe chat. Let's say we did this as an example, and we just spent some just doing some mock-ups. In my head, and again, I might be completely unfounded, I think this gets confusing if it's just a chat. It feels like, certainly the things I've done with you in the past, it feels like there's visual elements, there's assets that get produced, and just having a stream of text may not be the best interface. I don't know.

16:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, as time goes on, we can produce areas where reports are created on the fly, individual marketing reports, et cetera. But I think fundamentally, we are working towards a system that is not too dissimilar to what we have now interface wise because we don't want to start to be too adventurous because we won't get the first product to market and I do think we need to get something and then start to build on phase two as soon as we have phase one.

16:49 - Jonathan Phillips 
I think purely on, I mean, if we had unlimited resources, we could make it so whiz bang, it will be amazing. But I think we need to have something that works, that's functional, that's commercial. And then we build on that with phase two.

17:00 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, I agree. I think we need, we've got such a great proposition. We've got great sales materials, we've done a product. So I think the sooner, even if it's not where we want it to be, it's probably gonna be orders of magnitude better than what people have today. And that the expense and difficulty of running a marketing team at such a low price, this is gonna be game-changing. And then we make it even better over time. So I think it's great to hold those two divisions in our head, right? What do we want it to be in X period of time, but what are we good enough to launch with? But we have to document this, right? I mean, this isn't, we're doing this live in front of Jorge and Jonas. We need this kind of document. This is what our go-live plan is. This is what's good enough. Otherwise we'll be here in six months, right?

17:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So OK, so I read through the document last night, JP, the one where you went over post POC items and then things like the competition. Competition looks quite good, by the way. I haven't tested any of the things, but like their landing pages are quite nice.

18:02 - Jorge Lewis 
But just now you mentioned that you think you probably want to start. You already know it's proven and you want to go ahead and building something that people will buy rather than something to show off to investors. Is that correct?

18:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
Well, I mean, ultimately we need something to show anybody we want to talk to, whether it's partners, investors, uh, potential customers. So, so we, we do need that. So any sort of iterative version of the basics, you know, that's great. It's better than nothing. Um, but we have to move to something obviously as soon as possible. And that's, and that's what every client wants. They want something as soon as possible. So that's a given and it's, um, I think we've discussed many times internally, externally, that everyone's on a race at the moment with the whole of trying to launch and categorize AI and become leaders in various niches. It's a gold rush. So what we need to do is just make sure we're part of that and we're not sort of lagging behind a little bit Which is not on you guys because you're just new to the party So it's not like we're saying is anything wrong, but we just need to make sure that we are in a hurry so to speak rather than a rush for me the POC should be something we can demo to partners investors interested parties and

19:23 - Arif Harbott 
knowing full well that it's not good enough just to hand over to them to use, but it's good enough for them to go, wow, okay, great. I've read your sales material. You've actually got something. And then for me, the phase one is something we could actually sell. And that's for me how I'm thinking about it. But I mean, I haven't discussed that with JP or Kuhn, but that was what was in my head.

19:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
The POC is a demo pretty much. It's just to show people the concept. And it won't be a case of, It won't be of a caliber to be interrogated. It will just be of a caliber to show, and I don't like using the term smoke and mirrors, but hopefully it will give them the vision of what it can be in not too long a future.

20:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think this is maybe something we need to take away and come back. I don't want to take everyone's time off. Like, are we talking about on phase one that this is like a chat GPT interface, so you have a simple prompt, but you also then have all of your chat history down the side? Like, or is that the framework, the story, the sequence? Like, I think it is just a chat, but they, like, they're, unless you know what's happening, I think people just left with a blank box with just nothing else in it. They won't know what to do.

20:42 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, I don't think interface wise it would necessarily just be the chat window, but that will dominate and then obviously it will generate reports on the fly Just as chat GPT would if you asked it to generate a report,

20:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
but this will be higher caliber built on a specific framework Okay, maybe we can take that offline and I can just scratch that itch with you separately sure yeah And so going back to sort of the question in terms of if you're working on two projects, you're definitely not going as fast for each project if you were working on one of them. You're not a massively big team.

21:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
What is the, like, based on what you know today of doing, of JPs, where, working as you are today, making progress on both fronts, where do you think JP would have something to demo realistically? And if we stopped ADAPT and you did everything on that, where do you think it would be?

21:43 - Jorge Lewis 
For the demo, as in what we discussed previously, which is the workshop for understanding your why, right?

21:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Yeah, we were thinking end of next week, maybe early week after that, working on both projects. If we were to stop working on Adapt, it would free up Jonas's hands a lot. We'd probably be able to get it done, I'd say, The thing is with small POCs like this, having too many people on the same project, the biggest benefit then is just two minds on two minds. In terms of code and outputs, not much, but the benefit we get is having two minds on it, we get to go through problems faster, things like this. So I would say with something as small as this, I'd say maybe a week compared to two weeks.

22:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, could you get, I mean, if you can get adapt to the point where, which seems like you're very close to the point where the admin and the chat can interplay with each other, we could easily have weeks of testing. So you guys at that point could pivot completely on to IntelliAgent to get that version done and we're busy testing. Would that be an option?

23:05 - Jorge Lewis 
From what I think, yeah. But I don't know exactly how much you can test with the current version of Adapt. I would like to think that you can test enough to the point over maybe a week. And then from there, we can reassess where the direction we should go into. But yeah, that's what I think.

23:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think if we've got a chat and then the admin is list and I can go in and change the admin screens, which influences the chat experience, then I think that's, there's a huge amount of us just learning like the CoStar framework and how to write proper prompts and stuff like that before we start training the bot. That's going to take time, right? So that's downtime for you that you got, but you could be fully on IntelliAgent. So where do you, when do you think you could get adapt to that level? Feels like we're quite close to it, but there's just a little bit of disconnect between the chat and admin at the moment. Like, is that an end-of-day-to-day thing, and then you pivot on to IntelliAgent, or...?

24:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So I texted the plan earlier today to QM, but let me just repeat it. So we're pivoting from Python to TypeScript. TypeScript is where our entire web project is held. That transition might take... Two to four days. During that transition, we'll be just moving the code from Python to TypeScript. The side effects of that are we'll no longer have the API, which means we'll be able to move so much quicker. I'm very familiar with both TypeScript and Python, meaning I'll be able to work very closely with the web project and the AI aspect, meaning me and Jonas won't have to be like, hey, bro, is this done? What's wrong with this? It'll just be me being, oh, that's not working. Let me go fix it. So things will be able to move a lot faster. So starting today was, oh, disconnected again.

24:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
And just so that we're clear, we had that conversation, I can't remember where we ended up. We started with this being iOS applications and then you were requesting or suggesting that we move that to progressive web apps. But we've gone away from, we're now going back to iOS apps and Android apps.

25:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I can comment on that. As far as I know, the solution that you suggested of just placing it in an iframe, I tested just taking that to the absolute extreme and making it as a PWA, then placing that iframe of the PWA inside an application which can be turned into a native application. As far as I know, that just works. Of course, that can't be used offline, but none of these apps could be used offline either way.

25:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK, cool.

25:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

25:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
The one issue with that is Apple, historically, has had a lot of issues with apps that are literally a copy of a website. They tend to reject those apps from the App Store as installable apps.

26:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's something you could also look into if they would accept a native application that's just an iframe of a website as something that you can place on the app store. I think they'd be more willing to do it if you didn't have the website as a public website or something. But yeah, that's the biggest area where I'm concerned.

26:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean there's no way for us to find that out until you actually push it into Apple because they have a very pure process. Now the reason why we wanted to keep it as an iOS app is because we want to have access to the native applications like health and other metrics. So there's no reason why that app... I thought the chat element is the only bit of the iframe, rather than the entire LMS. So the LMS could be an iOS app, and just the chat element is an iframe. So that is actually different from the website. And I mean, similar functionality, but it would be app with iframe, as opposed to just the entire thing in an iframe.

27:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think a better like method to achieve that same goal would be to have the native integrations in the shell application instead call the API of the PWA because built into Svelte applications is always an API that's generated. We can call endpoints on that API with data from health apps and such.

27:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, it's obviously a huge concern, because we have no product of this on an iOS app, because it impacts notifications and integrations and stuff like that. So this feels like something we need to validate sooner than later. And I don't know whether we can validate it without actually having an app.

27:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because this feels like a huge amount of rework if you go down the PWA route, and then you have to roll back.

28:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Which is obviously super concerning.

28:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. We can take that offline.

28:10 - Arif Harbott 
Because IntelliAgent is just web-based, am I correct?

28:17 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah. I mean, to start with, obviously that's, you don't want to sort of cook so many pies. You just need to do one thing at the moment and get that done.

28:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay. So I was, where was I?

28:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah, so we were migrating the code. The idea was that by tomorrow, we could have something to hand off to Cuan, so he could start playing around with it. And then from the day after that, so I think Thursday, so from Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, we work on migrating the code. And then from Tuesday, we could start again either on AdapterStory or Intelligent.

29:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

29:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that okay for you, JP, Arif?

29:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

29:06 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, it does sound like we need to make sure we're having a lot more calls because it sounds like things are changing a lot. So whenever you guys are able to get around anything new, just hit me up and we can have another chat.

29:19 - Arif Harbott 
Should we create a live document, Kieran, that everyone has access to, that kind of has a better view of our requirements? Is that something we're going to do?

29:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Are you talking, well, for ADAPT, I have that. I have a Google Doc that I update and basically embellish whenever there's a sort of a question or clarification needed. And that's sort of what I was going to suggest that myself and JP worked on for IntelliAgent today. So that becomes basically like a feature roadmap. And then at least we're aligned at the major elements of the deliverable, the aspiration, put a little bit more meat on it. So at least then, you know, if you wanted to use agile terminology, you at least have all of the epics and the high level features identified and what the relationship is. So you know, okay, We're working on this epic and this feature today, because if we get aligned on that handshake, I think that becomes hugely useful in terms of keeping everybody aligned, rather than you having to give us laborious half-hour, 45-minute updates and we're up to speed. So I'm just trying to figure out how do we have a handshake that we're truly aligned on.

30:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me run a session with JP after I grab some food in the next hour or so, and we can flesh this out and see where we go.

30:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe I could even join along. I think that might be useful. What do you guys think?

30:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Happy to. Don't want to take you away.

30:48 - Jonathan Phillips 
In the first instance, I want to at least get a one-page A4 of what I think we're going to do, rather than do it live, and then we can work from that, maybe as an agenda.

30:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that sounds good.

31:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, my biggest concern just as of right now, I know you guys are going to sort it out. It's just that we're going from POC to MVP, really. MVP is just something that people will pay for. POC is something you just show off. So that's just my biggest concern. So keep me updated.

31:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Also, that changes the budget that you guys agreed on, because the scope boundary has now changed.

31:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It changes everything. Not only the obvious things like the budget and the scope, but also just the way we code things are a bit different.

31:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, okay.

31:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can I mention one thing on that? From how I see it, we could make the POC first as the agreed upon specs from before, and that'll give us the framework to continue to build on to achieve the MVP, which will afterwards in an extended scope and new contracts. Instead of trying to extend the current contract, I think that'll allow us to move a bit faster and get a product to you guys or something to you guys that you can demo with without it having to have the capabilities of being purchased with like tons of users and all that.

32:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, JB, do you, for me, if we ran a demo where someone could experience a workshop and the bots were just fricking awesome, rather than the shop windows we see at the moment that are terribly disappointing, I'm happy

32:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
with us continuing the way we're going. Proof of concept. I can go to people and demo to them and talk to them about it. That's what I need at the moment. And then from then we'll say, yep, that worked well. Let's get an MVP, specced out and done properly.

32:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
That's the thing. We should stick to where we are at the moment.

32:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Something I might want to suggest is a lot of times for very simple POCs and demos is they're done artificially. They're made like they're just videos. Is that something that's plausible? Because if the concept is proven in terms of technology, if it's proven already, then what you need is something to show off what it can do, not like it can do it.

33:13 - Jorge Lewis 
the fifth In terms of your guys' planning, could you provide us with a couple example workshops? Cuan has given me some resources to watch through for his project, but what about for stories? Or intelligence, sorry. Is there any workshops we can take a look at? Some live ones?

33:56 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, I mean, obviously we haven't got to this stage yet, but I'll spec out to you what my thought process is as far as What's the technology is going to deliver? So I think that's the point at the moment that we need to align on Yep, perfect.

34:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just like just so Jamie just so you know what that looked like, So as part of adapt there's a Framework called immunity to change which is a coaching framework to help people understand why they have unconscious behaviors for doing certain shit We had a girlfriend of Sonia's she did the course of this for an hour. She took us through it and I It was an interactive session rather than a theoretical concept of what we would like it to be. And then that was just recorded and we gave that to the guys. So it allows them to experience what an actual workshop is and also provides content potentially to train the bot at some point. Like there's an option is that whatever workshop we sort of go for is that you could actually run that with Sonya or myself as an example, we just record it and then that becomes the, because it's like those things like actually doing a workshop is a very organic, it goes off in all sorts of weird and wonderful ways. And I think that's very difficult to try and prescribe in a thematic without it being a real thing.

35:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I think a bubble that I need to burst is that the agents aren't flexible. We should be able to know where we want to guide them. We can give them, of course, we can tell them this is the workshop, try to follow these guidelines. We can, of course, tell them that. But if we ourselves don't know what exactly it looks like with a couple of examples, it's really hard for us to tell what the agents to follow.

35:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe if you could just have a couple, um, or just, yeah, maybe one or two examples of a full workshop that you can imagine the software doing the, to understand your why that one, it can either be a live one with you and other people, or another format could just be you imagining the, uh, the software doing the workshop and you imitate all of the agents you imagine in it.

36:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
If I could put it in one light, imagine if you guys were painters and you wanted us to paint something and you just described what a painting is without ever giving an example of a painting, it would be really hard to make a new painting. So we need a concrete example of what a full workshop looks like so we can have those aha moments and connect it to what you guys have described.

36:32 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, sounds like we've got some words too.

36:33 - Arif Harbott 
Alright, leave that with us.

36:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
JP, does that make sense? I just want to make sure that...

36:39 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, yeah, I think we need to have a chat about a few things, but yeah, I think we're in the right direction at the moment. I think we keep on what we're doing, but we need some more regular updates and a meeting like this is perfect.

36:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Last thing, for both Adept and Intelligent, how's the investments looking, like the rounds and all that? What's been...

37:02 - Jorge Lewis 
what's been set in stone already or what's happened? Do you guys have investors that are looking to invest, that are waiting for something to show or how is this?

37:14 - Jonathan Phillips 
No, nothing's in stone at the moment.

37:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:19 - Arif Harbott 
A lot of it depends on how good the POC is, right? I mean, it depends on how good the output is, because I think there are a lot of promises at the moment in the industry. We've got to show that we can actually build something and deliver something.

37:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you look at the health space, we've spoken to a couple of investors and a lot of them are like, they don't understand it, which is possibly our pitch on it, but they're like going, well, Apple does loads of stuff on health, you know, the limbo levels, they already have AI health coaches. So at a superficial word level, we're no different to anybody like, you know, but what we need to be able to do is like, okay, we'll go have a session. The experience of it, that's why I don't think a video works for IntelliAgent. We want the pitch to be, go do that, and have the bot guide them through that, and people go, oh, fucking hell, that was different. Didn't expect that. That's the impact that we want to have. If you have that, then that's the game changer, because I spam the shit out of JP on a daily basis going, oh, look at this website, look at this website, look at this website. The one you sent last week, Jorge, around the sort of the Slack destroyer automatic project management tool.

38:35 - Jonathan Phillips 
Oh, he's done enough.

38:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Jorge, you sent one last week around the Slack killer, the team.

38:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
The what killer? Slack killer.

38:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
It was like an auto AI for teams and it was amazing. And can you remember the name of that JP? You sort of tore it apart.

39:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't know, I can't remember. Most of them are smoke and mirrors. They clutter to deceive at the moment. And the majority of them are GPT with wrappers. They don't really offer anything special, but there's some really good marketeers out there making them look really, really nice. But we're going to get to a point where there's going to be an explosion. There's going to be so many of them, so much noise. You've got to do something a little different.

39:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
And sorry, yeah, so that company spent 90 grand, because the company who did it, they spent 90 grand on the homepage and the marketing website. And it looks like going, fuck me, it looks amazing. If it does that, Slack is dead. And then JP registered for the website. And the marketing site is this really futuristic, black, loads of colors, amazing. And then the website is this standard side nav, horrible gray, the same text with no features. Like it was completely false advertising. And I'm like, what a waste of 90 grand. I actually think the days of the amazing shop window with no substance behind it is just going to piss. You're going to make some business undoubtedly, but it's just horseshit. We're trying to go, we don't really fucking care about the shop window because we want the substance to be real. So people are going to say, we have that. So I think we've got to have that experience where people go, okay, this is different. Yeah. Yeah.

40:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Once the substance is there, get a beautiful mirror or a window. Sorry.

40:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, exactly. There's loads of complex, we know from a health point of view, the number one issue that people have is tracking calories. They fucking hate it. And it's just something they just don't want to do. There is, you can, I can go to chat GPT now and say, I just had some chicken and broccoli. What's my calories? And they'll give me an answer. It was like, what fucking size chicken did I have? Like if I had chicken breasts or one, it's a material difference. They're now using, take a photograph of your food and it will give you one. But I'm like, there's also those apps now where you can take a photograph of yourself or signing in your boxer shorts and it'll say how much body fat you have. I'm like, no, you're not. I mean, you're giving me an answer, but it's not accurate. It's just not accurate at all, but I don't, I mean, that's just sort of trivial sort of stuff. I think we're holding ourselves to a higher standard in terms of the service that we're going to give. And if it's not something that's good as close to what we would do, then we're not finished working on it.

41:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's a topic that I'm really ambitious on. It's getting language models to actually do the quality of stuff that you want it to, like what everyone claims it to do. Because I think it's possible, I really do. But it's just I don't know if they have bad and I like I don't think they have bad engineers Maybe they're just putting the money in the wrong places.

41:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know but I was speaking I was at a AI for cybersecurity event last night and Interestingly one of the things I learned is that you only need nine seconds of audio from someone's voice now in order to completely smooth them and the amount of like they were saying like the amount of times that banks have been called up and they've shifted they had some payment details but because we've used to use biometrics or voice for biometrics as a security barrier so it's completely pointless now it's dead because you can just duplicate people and one of the issues that they have with with AI Generative AI, by its nature, has no auditable trail as to how it made a decision. So if you're making a financial recommendation through AI, like if a auditor or a hedge fund planner says, I think we're going to, you should buy this or do that. There's a reason behind their assessment. When you ask generative AI, an answer for something, it doesn't have any evidence as to how it got there. And it won't get there at the same time you ask it the same question again. And that's amazing, right? Because that allows it to play hide and seek and come up with weird and wonderful strategies because it's constantly adapting. So that's brilliant. But it has no, I think what they call explainability. It can't explain how it gets to its answer. And so I think we've got to be careful about trying to cage the tiger and make it explainable. Without destroying its very essence.

43:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
How long ago was this talk?

43:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Last night.

43:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, was the person holding it? Well, I mean, it's just because there are a lot of ways for AI models to explain themselves. There's different techniques we can use. Inherently, they suck at it, but we can actually go backwards oftentimes, or sometimes we can go forward through a step-by-step process. Okay.

43:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, well, this was a censure, so they know anything.

43:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think usually, if you just ask an LLM for an answer, it'll just use its predictive text modeling to come up with something plausible. But what you can do is model it with a prompt or with techniques that makes it complete the task for a step-by-step process. So if you just ask it, give me a recommendation for a stock, it'll just come up with something. But if you give it proper instructions of, doing it in a step-by-step process, then it will do it in that step-by-step process, at which point it will have already explained itself once it picks the stock, for example. But if you just ask it for an answer, it's just like a predictive text model. It just predicts what's the next likeliest word. And that will just be the answer to how it came to the question is that was the likeliest word to come next.

44:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Makes sense.

44:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I need to grab some food.

44:50 - Arif Harbott 
I've got to go.

44:52 - Arif Harbott 
I've got a meeting in like 20 minutes. I need to grab some food.

44:55 - Arif Harbott 
Cheers, folks. Cheers.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (35).txt"

Mon, Jun 17, 2024

0:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

0:39 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Hey, man. How are you?

0:41 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Good, good. And you guys?

0:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, good, man. You're looking very tropical. Where are you? Still in Vietnam?

0:47 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
No, I'm in Thailand right now.

0:49 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Oh, you're back in Thailand now. Nice. Yeah, yeah. A good working space. You're looking a little bit slimmer. Obviously, the sickness has helped your weight problem.

1:02 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I think it's the business.

1:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I know stress is also a good weight loss.

1:15 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
It's not a good long-term strategy.

1:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I need to gain weight. I've lost like, I think, three kilos of muscle. I mean, some fat, of course, but...

1:24 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Wow, that's a lot.

1:29 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Cool. So what do you want to talk about? Milestones.

1:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, milestones. So again, also just a refresher for the things we haven't been working, because I've been going so deep into the AI stuff that I've kind of forgotten a lot of the other things.

1:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

1:51 - Jorge Lewis 
OK, so reminders, nudges, attainment badges. Attainment badges, same as milestones, right?

1:58 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yes, it is, yeah. So for example, let's say you're 10 in, and you've just hit 40 kilometers of walking. Now, so walking would be distance-based. But what we might want to do is translate that into, as soon as you've walked 42 kilometers, hey, you've just done your first marathon. Or you've just walked from London to Scotland, or stuff like that. So we'd want to put some emotive descriptor around it, as opposed to just the facts. You've done another mile. You've done another mile.

2:42 - Jorge Lewis 
I can't hear Sonia very much. Oh, Sonia, nice to meet you, by the way.

2:45 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Hi.

2:47 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
And then there's my sister, Lassie, as well. Hi, how are you?

2:50 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Hi, Lassie, nice to meet you.

2:51 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
You too.

2:51 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
We're just all in London at the moment.

2:59 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
You guys are going to be fucking barred from cutting my cheese.

3:02 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
He's very particular about how cheese is cut.

3:05 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
It's a shape, and you're supposed to cut it a certain way, and then they cut, they deform. Look at the deformity.

3:14 - Jorge Lewis 
My parents are the other way around. My dad does that.

3:19 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
You cut off triangles like that.

3:25 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Triangles.

3:26 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
It's all about triangles. Well, you get a better knife than this for a start. You take it off.

3:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So for the milestone or yeah, so milestones and rewards are the same thing. So for those, there's, is that going to be dynamic? Or is it going to be hard coded for the milestones?

3:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Like, what's that mean?

3:51 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So hard coded would be we would have explicit one. So when they hit 10, 15, 20, 35, 45, 50, 600, will remember that.

4:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Remember that we can also, I mean, we can also AI generate like massive list of like maybe a thousand hard-coded ones like thing then we can review we can make sure that we can review that things like oh you ran from the distance you walked was the distance between Spain right so there's that or we can have the AI and AI models determine okay this is a this can be considered a good milestone but I don't trust the validity of that one to be honest I think that was more effort than it's worth making it give good milestones I think under the hood I don't think it really matters.

4:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I think the customer is going to see this experience.

4:44 - Jorge Lewis 
It should just feel it should feel personal. It should feel not just the data should be have some meaning behind it. Just those two things right. Yeah.

4:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

4:53 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I think everyone would be pretty impressed by themselves if they think they bought a marathon in a week. Yeah.

4:58 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
You know, it's a nice thing to say. Accumulative is like, this is what you've done.

5:02 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I mean, over the course of a 10-week program, they'll walk about 420 kilometers. Assuming they're OK fitted, that could be as low as 200. It could be up to 500.

5:12 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Well, I mean, this is an app I use every morning. And you can see here, all I get is this thing here. 62 AD streak, three-day streak. It's like, what does that tell me? It doesn't, like, it's, yes, I don't, the streak's important. But actually, I become blind to it. It's like, yeah, whatever.

5:33 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Well, my Duolingo now, probably, I will stop what I'm doing and go and do it so I don't break my streak. So I do think if we could have a streak there, I think it's encouraging too, personally.

5:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Duolingo does an amazing job at helping keep the streak. They just have a lot of different things.

5:50 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah.

5:53 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
a good one as well. If you don't do it, you're not progressing in a way or you're going to lose.

5:59 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I mean, imagine the bot at 6pm and the bot goes, hey, do you want to check in? And they don't get an answer. It's like, hey, listen, you've been doing this really well. You've done 18 days in a row. Don't lose your streak. Yeah. So that would be part of the bot's engagement.

6:14 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I'd also try and do a code, depending on the time zone, at a time where it gives an opportunity to be able to complete it, like 4 or 5 o'clock rather than o'clock at night.

6:23 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
We need to figure out what that is for people, like when do they want to be, people will be asked as far as their profile, when do they want to be, do when do they check in.

6:32 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Right.

6:33 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Oh, that needs to go into the profile. It's sort of like preferred time for check-ins. Preferred time.

6:44 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Just actually on this while we're talking about it. We just had an interesting call with somebody who's helping us with this program and There's a workshop. I think I called I talked to last week to you about immunity to change Yeah, we were talking about doing this ourselves, but very quickly that just won't scale and I Think we're gonna try and moved for the bot

7:05 - Jorge Lewis 
to be running those workshops Which is limited change one is is finding the wire, right?

7:12 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
is understanding what's getting in people's way. There's quite deep-rooted, held beliefs around what is stopping you from achieving your goal. And most of it is unconscious. So it's a framework that you ask them certain questions to get them to those deep-rooted beliefs around themselves, which is what's causing them... That's what's getting in their way of achieving their goal.

7:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Like you want to lose weight, you're silly, loads of shit food. Why is that? Intellectually, you know you shouldn't be doing it, but there's a reason behind it.

7:48 - Jorge Lewis 
It's top down, right? It's a top down process of going... When you say top down... Behaviors and then... So you go from the behaviors to the reason instead of... Because I'm wondering, with psychology, I think everything is top down. Because to figure out the thing is rooted in subconscious is you need to... You can't just know them if they're unknown, so...

8:11 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, the way this is structured, and there are videos out there on immunity to change and what it means. It's a framework of like, what's your goal? What behaviors are you doing against that goal? So if I want to lose weight, I'm eating two chocolate bars a day. And then the third column is, what if you were doing the opposite of that? Then what would happen? How would that feel? What are you worried about if you actually start achieving your goal? And then that's when you start uncovering those limiting beliefs or something that's happened in your past that is stopping you from fulfilling that goal. So there's a structure to it that takes you through for the unconscious to become conscious. Did I explain that okay?

9:02 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I think so.

9:04 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Yeah.

9:04 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
And then from that, for now I know this information, what can I do to ensure I achieve my goal?

9:17 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
So for instance, you know, the defiance, you know, five-year-old child, I will do what I want, no one's going to tell me what to do. If you uncovered that going, oh, that's why I'm not achieving this goal, someone else told me. And what's that like, And what, how's that ruling me? So now I have awareness of it. I can do something about it.

9:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So for example, if the, um, if the bot starts to recognize that somebody hasn't done something for like three or four days in a row, it might say, Hey, listen, it feels like we could really benefit or you could benefit from a coaching session. Do you want to schedule it? And he goes like, when, when would you have an hour and then let's say I'll have an hour at 8 p.m. On Friday. It would schedule that and then at 8 p.m., 7.45, it'll go, hey, just want to remind you we've got our call in 15 minutes. And then it would run the workshop.

10:20 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
The workshop is the minute to change one.

10:23 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, it would take them through those steps.

10:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
The framework, yeah.

10:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Okay, so I thought this the framework was held or the workshop was held at the start like at the onboarding also or and we well so when I Just want to make sure I get my thoughts straight on this.

10:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So originally we were going to do a 30-minute discovery call with people figure out You know, do they either? You know, a lot of the feedback we've had is that people don't like to calorie count So what we were going to say is we've got two choices If you're willing to restrict your carbs to like pretty low every day, don't bother calorie counting because you're going to self-regulate because the amount of fat and protein you eat, you just, you can't, it's very difficult to overeat that. If you're not willing to compromise on your carbs, actually calorie counting becomes really important so that you don't eat, you don't, if you want to lose weight. In that conversation and talking to them about their goals and their why, we would, you know, we would have a sense of whether we think they're resistant or whether they're all in and they're going to do everything. If they're resistant, we were then going to offer them an immunity to change workshop call for an hour. Based on the feedback we've just had over the last number of days, we need to try and digitize that experience and let people start the program. And as and when they have issues, we would then say, hey, you said that you want to lose weight and you're going to do these things, you're not. So that would fill in the first part of the immunity to change automatically because we're not going to, we're not trying to run this for stuff outside the scope of the program. Like I'm learning to drive and I'm never, I'm just not sticking to it. Like I don't give a shit about that. That's not part of our scope. But so the goal and the context for the Immunity Change Workshop will be set by what we're observing them not doing in the program.

12:15 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
And so you end up just going through in steps two, three, four, and five. All right. Do you think, you know, in terms of the profile, would you, would you want to, do you think if you were, if this was happening to you, would you want to see that conversation in your profile? Obviously, we as a company need to keep that for continuity and awareness. But would you as a customer think you'd want to see that in your profile?

12:47 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Like the chat history?

12:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

12:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Of the workshop?

12:55 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. Maybe we create an updated version of the form as a visual for them to see.

13:04 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah.

13:08 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm not sure. Why wouldn't I? What would be the reason?

13:13 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, I don't know. Because at the moment, the profile was just quite those sort of static lists. But actually having a full history, I think, makes sense, because they might want to go over something again.

13:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, because, I mean, technically, the entire user's chat history is stored. So if we want to pull it into a more displayed view, that's possible.

13:38 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Okay. Cool.

13:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay. So how about we put the, um, how, how important is the, that workshop?

13:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Um, so it's pretty, we think everybody has some level of unconscious issues that they are going to need help with. Um, we also want the boss to do the onboarding. So that's like, you could call that a workshop cause it's got various steps and questions that we'd want them to flow through. So, in my head, and maybe you correct me if I'm wrong, that we have the capability to run workshops, we need to design the workshop, as opposed to there be a bot designed that you would codify the onboarding and you would codify the immunity to change. I think you give us the capability and we will need to teach the bot to do them.

14:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a mix of both. Some things like, for example, the onboarding one, some of the things we'll need to code in, the things like interacting with the database, adding the user's goal, Things like this. Yeah How about this? How about you send me an example a conversation of the the workshop? I think you might have sent it a resource on it.

14:44 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Actually, I'm sure I sent you an image of it But like are you guys okay if we send him the hour-long conversation with backs? Yeah, we have an hour video of where back this lady who knows it really well took the three of us through it Okay You should, if I put this in your, yeah.

15:22 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yep. There's a, you can look at the whole workshop there.

15:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me check if I can open it. Yeah. Okay. So I can share this with the rest of the team or yeah.

15:38 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Now we're alone. All right.

15:41 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
A lot of it can be, there was a lot of chats and questioning.

15:45 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So rather than pure content.

15:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Just 1.5 speed. No problem.

15:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay. Okay. Yeah. So we'll put that on a little bit of a hold. Um, just because I think that could be added on quite easily. Like when we're working on the onboarding bot, we can take a look at it again. Or the onboarding aspect. Okay, so back to the reminders. Reminders and nudges is totally different. So for reminders and nudges, what does that look like again?

16:19 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So a nudge, so if we know, for example, onboarding that you drink coffee, that's another thing actually missing from the profile is you know, at 12 o'clock, you'll get a, the bot will just let you know, or send you an email saying, Hey, this is an FYI, no more, you know, to optimize for your sleep, don't have any more coffee today.

16:46 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Or if you're going to have a coffee, have a decaf.

16:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
So that's, yeah, you can have another coffee, make sure you have it in the next two hours. Or it's decaf.

16:55 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. And one of those, that's a reminder. I did have a, we did have a difference between a nudge and a reminder. I'm a bit, what, I can't remember in the mural, I think I had a definition of what the difference was. I'm just trying to open it now.

17:12 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
It's a reminder, have you done this? Which is part of what they've agreed to do in the day. Well, a nudge is have you had your water?

17:29 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I can't find it right now, but technically, I think they end up being the same thing.

17:34 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So you have reminders or nudges to do behavior like drink the water, no more coffee, no more screens.

17:44 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Have you had your walk?

17:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
It's accountability. That's all it is. It's accountability reminders. You're just looking at all the things that you said you were going to do and do we help you do them?

17:56 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
And so that would come from the profile. And obviously someone could say, stop reminding me about this.

18:01 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, they can turn off. Like, if they don't want to be reminded about their water intake, they could turn that fucking off. Or if they're not coffee drinkers, that wouldn't even go on.

18:12 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, yeah, because we know about that as part of the onboarding profile.

18:14 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Right, sure, that's different, yeah.

18:19 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
And it's also like if they've done their walk, I don't know, if they've done a walk and they've already keyed that in or said, I've done my walk today, they don't get reminded about it.

18:27 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, because they can go to the website and fill in the data. At that point, when we do the check-in, the bot would only be asking about stuff that's missing.

18:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So behind the scenes, how I'm thinking, and Quinn, hopefully you can understand this so you can correct me. So a user will have a list of, in the database, there's going to be a list of reminders. And every day, just throughout the day, the bot's going to check, has this reminder been accomplished yet or not. If not, then send it. Otherwise, don't send it. Regarding the time, that's also dependent on the actual reminder itself, right? The time of reminding. Like the coffee one?

19:12 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. So there's reminders, and then there's items that we track. And maybe technically, they're all just a reminder. But the idea is that reminders would have a set time in which to do them. So for example, if we know that your bedtime is 9.30 broadly from you've been adding in when you're going to sleep. So we don't ask that question. We infer that question. We would then work back saying, right, three hours before then, no more screen or no more work. Try and stop work now because your brain can decide to relax. So that would be a dynamically based on when we know you're going. I need that reminder.

19:55 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
And then the items to track are an end-of-day check-in reminder, which basically goes in and would look at all the things that you're supposed to track on a daily basis. What have you not been proactive on? Now, I would imagine if people get used to the fact that there's a check-in bot, they're not going to start. They're going to not end up going in and proactively track things in the morning. They'll wait until the bot does an end-of-day check-in. Rather than going in and I did this for this lunch or I just did my walk.

20:23 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
What about as the body's checking in, how you kept hydrated and you do a tick, have you done your walk a tick? That it propels your end of day?

20:30 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
That's what it does. That's what I'm saying. So let's say 7 o'clock, you've filled in your walk, but you haven't filled in your calories. It will then say to you, hey, so what did you eat today? Like how many calories? It wouldn't ask you about the walk. And what I'm assuming is, if you've been doing this for a week, you would probably stop filling it in and you'd just say, I'll just wait for the bot. I'll have a conversation with the bot at the end of the day.

20:52 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Tracking, I mean, you know very easy, you've done your walking up, that's obviously not disputable. But if you don't track the calories in the moment, especially things like snacks, you forget what you've eaten. So it starts like, here's a comment as you gob it.

21:05 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, there's nothing precluding you from doing that. I just think it's user behavior, because you have the bot hoovering up everything with you at the end of the day. I think that could, I think that's the issue. A walk, you know what you've done. If you've eaten three times that day and you haven't actually tracked your calories, how do you, you're unlikely to remember them.

21:28 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
You have to be done at the moment. So like by 12 noon, if you've had breakfast today, you might remember by 12 what you've had for breakfast.

21:35 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So there's an end of day check in, but I think for food, you might want to do it incrementally throughout the night.

21:39 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yes, I think so.

21:41 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So again, that's the bot proactively doing it. But if they're doing intermittent fasting, which is another thing we need to have in the profile, then there's no point checking them for breakfast because they won't have their first meal until 12.

21:59 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Yeah, but my preference, if they give you the window of intermittent fasting, the first prompt will be 2 o'clock, when you had your first meal of the day. Maybe just call it your first meal of the day, not breakfast.

22:10 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So we need to figure out what the profile really is then, because I think the profile that I've just given them is old and not as enriched as we'd like it to be.

22:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So what it sounds like there is each user will have a generic reminder for the eating part, just to make it easier to track, because people don't like tracking.

22:28 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. But again, if they're doing, um, the low carb approach, then we're not tracking every meal.

22:34 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
It would just be like, you don't have to at all.

22:37 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
No, just at the end of the day, you're basically saying, did you keep within your, your, your carb tolerance today? Yes or no. Yep. Cool. Well, nice one. Nice job. Now, obviously you can lie. If you've eaten 5,000 calories and you put in a thousand, we can't, we can't, we can't change that.

22:50 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
But there's an element of people are telling the truth.

22:53 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
They're only fooling themselves. Now, if their if their weight is not going down correlation to what they're saying they're doing, then that would be an investigate.

23:00 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
We would basically say, hey, listen, it doesn't feel and maybe some of the prompts from the vast power along the line said, you know, make as accurate as possible. This is for you. You can tell me anything you want.

23:09 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
But ultimately, yeah, of course. You know, I mean, the people say like even on keto, they go my way. It's not shifting. It's like we're careful on even though we can eat fat. Don't go overboard on fats, because that can have an impact, because that's calories. So while yes, if they're low carb, they don't have to track, if all you're having is cheese and nuts, you might not shift the weight.

23:34 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
There's a lot of calories there.

23:35 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah. So it's a yes and

23:40 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
It's within that, even low carb, keep an eye on the healthy fats, because they are very calorific. And unless you're very active, the fat won't get burned because you've got too much fat than you're burning.

23:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

24:05 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
So do we need to update a profile or something to help move it along?

24:11 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I've tried to create here a a bot doing an AI version of sort of unlocking your limiting beliefs, but it's only yes, no, or I don't know. And then if it's a majority of yeses, this is what it indicates and how to mitigate it. If it's a majority of no's or I don't no's, equally, it gives you a lack of self-awareness and it gives you strategies as well. Because I think the bot obviously works better with the yes, no, I don't know, like just a no.

24:35 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
No, but I don't know what, when you say a bot, I don't know what technology you're using there, which is not, that's not how, that's, that's.

24:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Try, try bot in terms of asking, the questions the bot would ask the human.

24:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
You don't do yes, no, it's not the way it works. It's very much on the, actually the more verbose descriptives that you get subjectively, it's more, it's more beneficial.

24:59 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
But I'm just thinking for a human to answer, it's much easier to do yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.

25:03 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Like give me a scenario.

25:06 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Is your health and wellness, stroke, weight loss important to you? Yes, no.

25:12 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
It's a quick, I'm trying to see like how can something...

25:15 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Are you talking about onboarding now? Yeah. Okay. Again, it depends. I think we need to figure out what are the things we want to ask. Certain things are just like, what is your height? It's not a, but your goals and your why, I think can be, like someone can be very verbose and they can infer what's important to them and help them get to that.

25:34 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
The same here, like yes, no, don't know format makes it easy for the AI to process, analyze, response, providing a clear path to identifying, overcoming, measuring beliefs about weight loss.

25:44 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
But which AI? It depends what technology they're using and what they're talking about because generally where you see AI with yes, no answers, it's rudimentary and it's actually rules-based. It's not generative AI. So it depends. And again, when they just use generic terms like that, Send it to me, I can have a look at it and see what they're doing. So we can send you an updated sort of profile and I think what we'll do is we'll start talking about what the onboarding conversation would look like,

26:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, and then I have the workshop one, the immunity change.

26:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, you have that video, yeah.

26:23 - Jorge Lewis 
For the attainment badges, I'll do what we said and just make a pretty long list that the bot can choose from

26:38 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
What would we have that for? How far you've walked? I don't think how long you've walked. Like you've been walking for a day, whatever, maybe you do that. Then there's eating. I think weight loss goals, I think will be a big one, like what you've lost.

26:55 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
But I think like you've eaten, I think streaks for tracking stuff.

27:03 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
The sleep, like how you keep into going to bed, waking up.

27:07 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I think you'd have a, I think what we're going to do is have some form of like, I think somebody was saying like, what is the, how close is the median hour of your sleep to each other? So for example, you could be getting eight hours of sleep, but on a Friday, you start going to bed at a.m. And you're getting up at 10 a.m., you've shifted the median point of your sleep by more than two hours, then that causes jet lag.

27:32 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yes, I heard that on the podcast.

27:33 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, so you've got to look at sort of a sleep health indicator or sleep quality indicator. Basically, that's just a trending line saying, yeah, your sleep seems to be good.

27:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yes.

27:43 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Maybe once every two weeks, we might do a deeper coaching on one of the areas.

27:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:49 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
If people are available.

27:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Does that make sense?

27:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. I mean, just for that, we need to just get the sleep time and the wake up time, I'd say.

27:59 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. And then we infer the rest of it.

28:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

28:05 - Jorge Lewis 
What about sleep quality? Is there something?

28:16 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
We talked about what time are you going to bed? What time are you waking up? And I think we talked about sleep quality being the sense of, did you have the sense that you woke up? No, did you wake up during the night?

28:31 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Oh, I see.

28:33 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Because you can't tell whether you feel rested or not rested or deep.

28:37 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
It's perceived.

28:38 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
It's perceived. Did you wake up? Did you go to the toilet during the night? How many times did you get out of bed? I think we need to figure out what that other, the sort of interrupter index is. I think Matthew Walker talks about that.

28:54 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Or did you use our sleep meditation app last night?

28:57 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
That's got nothing to do with sleep though, in terms of the sleep quality.

29:01 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
If they can track when they use it, they sleep better. There's a correlation.

29:05 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I think we've got to be careful because that's going into, like you are going into an Apple Watch and all these guys, there's so many sleep scores and they're so wishy-washy. Because you've got diet and exercise. I look at my ones, and I've got about 15 metrics that I can track. And I just do one of them. It becomes too much, and you end up not using it. But you don't just fill them all in.

29:41 - Jorge Lewis 
The move is just minutes that they've been exercising, right?

29:47 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
It's an hour a day. It's focused. So move is everything to do with the body moving and exercising. So it can be initially, the focus will be about walking in zone two for an hour a day. But towards the program, you'll be doing, you know, you'll work up towards a 10K. We'll introduce some very basic physical exercise, like jumping, squatting, stuff like this. So it's everything to do with how you move your body. Predominantly, it's walking, but it will be more than that.

30:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. Cool, cool. Let me see what else.

30:31 - Jorge Lewis 
For the programs, I don't understand the part where it says ability to run 12 programs at the same time, but then before that says customers allocated one program at a time. So, yeah.

30:42 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So this, let me just, so I think this means we've talked about whether we would have three, three, three people coming independently and they just start when they start, like we haven't.

30:52 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I think we also said probably nothing July, August and December. So it'd be a maximum of nine programs a year, possibly.

30:59 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
If everything is digital, why?

31:03 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
If it's all digital, people can sign up at any time and start their program.

31:08 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I don't think we can say we don't want a program for three months of the year. There isn't a person in the world who would sign up and invest in a company that It's not shutting down because there's going to be programs that are changing it.

31:20 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
Yeah, well, it makes a difference.

31:22 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
But we're not having cohorts.

31:23 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So we're just having someone wants to sign up. Are we doing the body slams like there's a start and an end and you sign up into those windows? I like the start and end.

31:32 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
But it can be rolling every month start. So you want to have 12 cohorts.

31:36 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Then if you're going to do that, then why not just have it you start when you start? You could start next week. I could start the following Monday. I have my own 10-week program.

31:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
If the hangout, the idea was, one idea we had was the hangout that we'd have is live for everybody who's on the course, no matter where they are in their journey.

32:02 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Because the chances are, if you do have a three block windows, you're telling customers they might have to wait two and a half months.

32:14 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
bad reason for doing it. And if you don't do that, then you may as well just do, well, you can sign up whenever you want. You start when you start.

32:21 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
But then you've got, kind of like the idea of the cohort, but not obviously every month, it's not too long to wait, because the likelihood that you've picked up on, you know, you might only have perhaps two weeks to wait when you sign up to when you start.

32:37 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
But why not do it every day?

32:39 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I think a cohort and a community, it starts becoming difficult in a Q&A point where you've got people literally on every single day, at least month by month, you've some community that you can reach out to on Facebook and people on the same point as Jeremy. I just think every day is...

32:53 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I think it would have to be every week anyway. I think we don't have a definitive answer on that, but we'll take that as... We'll have that debate and we'll come back with you an answer today on the schedule. A person can only be on one course at a time.

33:14 - Jorge Lewis 
One course at a time, okay. The LMS is the least speculative aspect in terms of tech. It's been done thousands of times before. It's a matter of how we want to do it.

33:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we just need to let you know.

33:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, yep. Cool. What else?

33:37 - Jorge Lewis 
For the, okay. So as of right now, so I mean, I was really hoping we could get it all set up today in terms of the, oh, just so you can play with that. What was the, just the whole chat bot, but sadly some of the time difference between Jonas and I didn't help.

33:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So what would be the next on the list that you guys would want to get up So when you do the release tomorrow, what do you think we'll be able to do?

34:09 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
By what function are you?

34:11 - Jorge Lewis 
You'll be able to do, to start a check-in, to complete the check-in, and then, yeah, doing the check-in, and then you'd be able to, for the admin use case, you'd be able to go through the user's messages, all the user's messages, and then select good or bad ones, and then manage it, manage those submissions.

34:27 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
And if we update the admin, will that then, if we then did another check-in, will that take the feedback? So we can see that cause and effect.

34:37 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Yeah. Okay.

34:39 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
For me, that's a really important milestone because it allows us to start training the bot to do things. And then after that, I think onboarding.

34:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Today, I'm going to get started on trying to figure out some prompts to leave you guys with because it's, um, A standard prompt that you'd give like something like chat GPT is very different to what we're trying to give to these ones, because we have to give them the context of, hey, you have a team member, you know, pass it to this team member when this or this. So there's a bit of a difference in terms of that. And then also, also trying to make them uniform in terms of the persona, making sure that they abide by their, their style, tone, things like this.

35:21 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
So how important do we think makes lots of different personalities for the person?

35:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't think I don't think you'd notice that the actual personalities, as long as we don't tell them this is multiple bots, they like they're not going to realize it because No sorry, what I was meaning is that like,

35:41 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
there is some people who might prefer sort of the Arnold Schwarzenegger tone of voice like straight to the point, and others might like a more you know, uh, cheerleadery type. So there could be good work.

35:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Awesome.

35:53 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. Over the top like that. Some people really like that. Um, like in, in work, for example, there's something called the shit sandwich of feedback, where if you're giving people that work for you feedback, you say, Oh, you know, you did a really good job yesterday. And then you say, but you were shit yesterday. And then, Oh, I really like you. So you say something good and good. And then you give the real message in the middle personally that aggravates the living shit out of me. I can, I, it pisses me off, I know it's coming, but then even people know it's coming, like Jen, who used to work for me, she's like, no, no, if you don't give that to me, I will shut down. I will not hear the message. So I have to land it right. Even she knows that it's coming. She has to be landed into it and then she's ready. And then she has to be sort of massaged afterwards to go, yeah, it's everything's fine now. We did like, we had like 60 people working for us and was broadly 50, 50 between people who liked it and people who aggravated, really weird.

36:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
So for us, how do we?

36:52 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Well, I think as part of the awarding, we could ask people like, hey, do you like direct talking? Or do you like to be cheerleaded? Or we can figure out what the dimensions are, and we can ask them on that so they can tweak it. Like there's a, in chat GPT, there's like, if you put in no yammering, The answers are really punchy. And I'm like, if I'm doing research to get all of the facts and the nicety nonsense, it just gives me all the facts. And I'm like, much easier, much easier. But if you're coaching somebody, that wouldn't be appropriate.

37:23 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah. Because you need the fluff.

37:26 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. And again, I've had coaching clients where they at different times have wanted me to be really direct.

37:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:35 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Because I can feel that the nice, nice approach is not moving them forward and I have to call it out.

37:39 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, totally. That's why it's challenging because what I find with my clients, when I'm asked, how do you want me to be with you in a coaching corner when you're not doing something you said you were going to do?

37:51 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Do you want to be correct? Do you want me to be direct?

37:54 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
And most people actually go, So I want you to be direct because it's in service of me. Yeah, so it's about that for me. And it's holding up the mirror what we call. It's like, do you realize you said you're going to do this, but you're doing that. So I'm just calling it out with love and compassion and want the best for you. But this is why I'm calling this out. So I think there's this terminology that we can use.

38:28 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, but then, I don't know, could we have a stream of prompts which are a lot more harsher? Like, you idiot, you haven't done your walk, get up. I don't know, I might have done too much. You know, I put on overdrive. Yeah. Well, on my watch, when I haven't moved for a while, it's like, time to stand up, you know, and it's like, well done, you stood up, you know.

38:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, then there's the other hand.

38:58 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
And it's like, you haven't done what you said you're going to do. You're not going to reach a goal if you don't do this. And then when you do it, it's like, amazing. Well done, you. I can see you commit. So you can do both. It's not one or the other. Yeah.

39:14 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I think you're prompted to do it and to do it.

39:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

39:19 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah. The cheerleader. Because we all like being told that we're good or we've done something good. And we're really not.

39:27 - Jorge Lewis 
One of the difficult things that I can see happening is that with an in-person meeting, you can see, you can get feedback from your responses. But with this, it's going to be very hard to, like, the bot's going to say, get up, you lazy, you know, whatever. And then the user is going to say, oh, sorry, like, it's going to have no clue if he did a good job or not.

39:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, that's the thing. When you're coaching people face to face, You pick up. It's the body language. You can see someone comes to the call and they've been crying. I'm not going to be a bitch to them. I'll be like, geez, what has happened?

40:06 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I mean, if you look at chat GPT 4.0, there are the demos where it basically just goes, the guy's talking about, I'm going to go into an interview and the bot's like going, well, you know, you've mastered the getting out of bed phase, like your hair is a bit messy, you know, you need to, you know, if you're going to go to an interview. So it is there, it can now see, and it can talk. Like, how mature, I mean, because some of these things feel much better talked. And like, could we take that modality into our scope? Or is it going to be text?

40:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Text, uh, I'd say we'd be over, we'd, we'd be overstepping, um, trying to go directly into, into voice or, um, yeah, voice and video. It's cause it's like a step above text. You start off with text and then you go into those, skipping the text phase. We, if we skip the text phase, we might end up with something that doesn't even work as, um, like at all, like something that isn't usable.

41:13 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Use the teaching of the text to go to speech later.

41:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. Like, for example, a problem that I can see is like we use the voice and video feature, and then the responses are just like 30 seconds to wait. Because in the video, in the demo videos, have you watched, Sonia, the demo videos from GPT 4.0? No.

41:44 - Jorge Lewis 
It was the guy talking to his phone, and the phone had the new GPT model. The response times, I believe, were probably between 5 to 10 seconds. Gwyn, can you hear me?

41:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

41:57 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you say? That's about right, 5 to 10 seconds?

42:01 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
About 10 seconds.

42:03 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, the live's not perfect.

42:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but then also, since we're doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes, and as we're already seeing that it's adding some some delay to the responses, it can probably get pretty unbearable in terms of response times. We don't have to use GPT-4 as well, or for the newest model. We can use a mix of a really fast text model and then a really fast voice model, and then combine them instead of just using one.

42:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I hope you can hear me because I wasn't...

42:39 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
He's making a coffee, but he can hear you.

42:50 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Thank you. Ice cream coffee. Have you made yours?

42:59 - Jorge Lewis 
What beans are you guys having?

43:02 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Sorry? What beans? Beans.

43:08 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
What beans are you having? Is that notes? Yeah. Notes beans, you know notes?

43:16 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Notes, no.

43:18 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
It's a company that, it's a coffee shop, but it also does its own beans, but I wouldn't be very prescriptive. I use an espresso machine. So it's, I like the Costa Rica ones.

43:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice. Those are good.

43:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

43:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So you guys are in London? You guys live there or holiday?

43:43 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
We live in London and Lassie, Coen's sister.

43:46 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
I live in Dublin but I'm just over for the weekend.

43:50 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Coen and I are obviously in London, then Lassie's in Dublin when we can all three meet.

44:04 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 3 
In fact, online really does work very well as well.

44:07 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, well, it's like working with you guys online and we think it's a little bit.

44:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's we're quite lucky that my schedule is quite late because we can see, for example, Jonas's schedule doesn't align as well as my one does.

44:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Where's he?

44:25 - Jorge Lewis 
No, he's in the same place as me, but it's just he sleeps at normal people time. He wakes up at eight, goes to sleep at, you know, like 12. But I go sleep around four and wake up around Right.

44:43 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
We'll have a question.

44:48 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
He's just doing the milk. 30 seconds.

44:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Or can I have...

45:07 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
I think the most important thing is for us to work on the onboarding.

45:10 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, so we're going to work on the onboarding. And then we'll send that to you. And then do we need to do any more work on the profile? You mentioned it was maybe... That is onboarding, fine. Okay.

45:25 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, the onboarding is about engaging with the user.

45:28 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Setting up the profile.

45:31 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Okay.

45:34 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 2 
Anything else you need from us?

45:39 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm taking a look. I don't think so. Shouldn't be. Today I'm going to get working on the prompts and hopefully I can send it to you guys and you can start playing around with it by tomorrow. I was really hoping for it to be done today so that we could start working on the next phase.

45:55 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Yeah.

45:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

45:56 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
So that should be it.

45:57 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 1 
Thanks, man.

46:00 - Jorge Lewis 
No worries. Thanks so much. It was lovely meeting you, Sonja and Lasse.

46:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye.

46:06 - Conference Room (Sonia Calvo) - Speaker 4 
Have a good day guys.

46:07 - Unidentified Speaker

Wed, Jun 5, 2024

0:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me let me show everybody can see my screen All right, I can see it Okay, cool. So, um, I sort of took this as inspiration. I to be honest, I I Didn't know how to read it. It needed it felt like it needed a voiceover But what I did was I've taken this as inspiration to do my own version. Not necessarily saying this is what it needs to be, but as a way of trying to understand what I think it was trying to achieve. So the idea here is that you have, um, a user message and then you'd have the adapt response so that the user sees the context and then add a question as like, does the user need to see more than one message to understand the context of what we're engaging with? And then what I think you're trying to, or we're trying to say is, okay, what was good about the response? What was wrong with the response? What was missing? Do I want to restrict knowledge? So for example, let's say the message was, give me a recipe for 500 calories, as an example. If there's something to do with recipes, we might want to restrict that to some specific content in our knowledge base, as opposed to the entire LLM data. And then follow on is, this would be where we would want you to take the conversation forward. I just made all of these up, by the way. You might go, that's not the way it works. And then I was thinking, as we train this, we may want to have new categories or rows. So this would just be a new row where you'd have a label and then a content. So am I correct in thinking that all these things, all these are just doing is creating a prompt that then goes into the system and there's just, don't do this, but do do that. Is that broadly sort of how it does?

2:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. So how familiar are you with Reg? You mentioned it, you brought it up last time.

2:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
I know the concept, I've obviously never built it or applied it.

2:30 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so just an overarching view. So RAG, it converts a document like you described last time into a vector database. That part's not important. But what it does is when you ask it a question, it'll query that vector database for something similar, as similar as possible. And it'll just add that piece of text to the prompt and then reply based on that. So what we're going to do is going to use RAG for examples. So we're going to make a large document full of examples. We're going to have one document perhaps for the good ones and one for the correct ones. And for the correct ones, it's going to be all the data you pretty much listed. Well, right now the data we're thinking of using is the

3:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually, we're still debating whether it's going to be better to provide more context, so more than one message prior, but at least the last message. So in this case, when should I take showers? And then the ideal response. The interesting thing is that language models don't perform well at all if you provide an example of a bad response, which is kind of a nuisance, but oftentimes what happens is if you get a bad response.

3:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you mean by a bad response? Like you don't, so you don't tell us what not to do. You tell us what it needs to do.

3:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, yes, exactly. Right. So, so in, in our, in the data that we'd be giving it, like in the example data that we'd be giving it, we don't want to include the bad response. We can try experimenting and see what happens, but from our experience, that always doesn't end up well. Um, So we're able to fit more data just by skipping that part out and providing the ideal response.

4:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what's the difference between good and corrective?

4:10 - Jorge Lewis 
So this corrective was just us trying to make it not seem negative. Those are the bad examples.

4:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the context is for both of them. So the bot says things, user goes, when should I take showers? So what we don't know is what did the bot say to that question?

4:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So we do. What the bot responded was, once a month is good. So that's where it went from Okay, and then the bad because like in the next in the what you showed me is In essence that your one is actually more well-informed, but it's just give a reason why it was bad It could be the reason it could be it's it hallucinated information. It didn't take into account the users chat history it's it It was insensible like these things like this and over time after you complete a couple of examples You'll be able to create like standards of just copy and paste this reason this reason this reason for a couple of prompts What does there does the reason what was wrong?

5:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Would that be better off to have a selector box of the reason why it was wrong hallucination? So it's controlled or is free text better?

5:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I was also thinking about having like a dropdown for all of them. I think free text for now is good. Later down the road, if we switch it to a dropdown, like after we do free text and we see all of the options, then we can probably convert it to a dropdown. Converting the data isn't hard.

5:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
So like if you do free text now and we can- Yeah, you probably wouldn't do dropdown because you're going to most likely have multiple selections because it could be this and this and dropdowns don't work. But you can just have a list out and you can just select all areas.

5:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like hard code. Yeah.

5:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
But just- So the reason why I wanted to do this, this sort of tries to tell a story. The user said this, you responded with that, and then we're giving you our judgment of whether that was a good, bad, or what we would have done differently.

6:06 - Jorge Lewis 
But something to note, quite importantly, is that if you go back to the second slide.

6:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Or well, the one before that, sorry. So in this one, what we're going to provide the bot at first is going to be the last, this is what I'm thinking, the last message. So when should I take a shower? And then the next line will be when your wife says you stink. That's what we'll be providing to the bot right now. The reason we're trying to collect the other data like context and bad response is for later down the road. If this, if the simple solution doesn't, isn't high quality enough, we'll be able to use this data that you're inputting later down the road. Even if it is good enough, we can still use the data you're inputting now, later down the road to even improve it further.

6:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

6:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cause I, when I'm reading this screen, it doesn't, I don't understand how to read it. Because the context is universal to good and corrective. There shouldn't be a context that's for good and correct. There should be one context, and you're just giving it a, what went well, what didn't go well. I mean, so given what I've done, is this format something that we could work with? This sort of more--.

7:23 - Jorge Lewis 
And the message I sent, the left and right form, those should be two different forms. We were just sketching it out, so I forgot to, I should have separated them.

7:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
And what's this one? Is this basically the same?

7:34 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is so to just to Go through with it. This is so if you click on the page Examples or something. This is where you get get led to the top two ones Those are the two tabs so you can pick which one you're viewing and then if you click on a row like of the open button For example, it'll open the form here like one of the forms. Yeah, not both of them.

7:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
So basically this is this will be a list of responses It doesn't necessarily need to be a bad response. These are just a list of responses, because I'm assuming if a response is perfect, we might want to go more of this. This is excellent. Do this more.

8:11 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what the ideal examples are for. So when you see something that's like a plottable, we want you to save it.

8:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

8:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I understand. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is pretty true. You want to be as implicit as possible with this bot. You want it to tell it how to behave, not how to respond.

8:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so basically, you're saying more of this or less of this response. So each response comes in, and you're saying more of this, less of this, what was good about it, what was wrong, what was missing, restrict knowledge, follow on. And I think if you have that for every message, and then this page would just be a list of messages. And you have, was this something that you wanted more of or less of

9:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So what we're, okay, I'll touch on that in a second. But what I was saying earlier was just the, to make it so by providing it examples, that's explicit, we're giving it explicit examples of something and then how to react to it. But then if we give them enough examples over time, it'll inherently understand more implicitly what it should be behaving as. That's what a language model is. It's just, if you provide it with a good context, it'll respond more like that. That's, in essence, what a language model is.

9:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because you're basically saying, you know, something like this. This is a more. This is a more.

9:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is less. Let's call this just red for now.

9:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
which is basically just a list of, these are all the messages. And you're saying, this was a good one, good one. This was the last one. And so.

10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So is just that left column is supposed to be bots, right? Like bot message or? Those should be bot messages, right? Yeah. Yeah.

10:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, what becomes potentially interesting is filtering these by the different types of message. Was this a nudge? Was this about eating, mind, sleep? There might be subsections of where it's struggling or doing really well. So eat messages, mind messages, nudges, reminders, check-ins. There will be different categories of these as well.

10:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Not yet, but we're actually, for the bot, it's going to be a combination of LLMs or, it's gonna be a combination of bots behind the scene. It's going to, but behind the scenes, it's going to be multiple bots. Each bot is going to be dedicated for one thing. And we're gonna have a thing called a router, which makes sure that Or it's gonna check the message and say which bot is best fit answer this message so for example, one of the bots will be the check or one of the Personas they'll all have the same personality. It'll act like the same person, but it's going to have different behind the scenes like functionalities yeah, one of them is going to be for Doing the check-in one of them is going to be for motivation. One of them is going to be Analyzing the the behavior or the tracking data that's going to be doing that. So behind the scenes, that's what it's going to be doing. So that way, we're going to have much more fine-grained control over the prompts of each microbot or module. And then, yeah.

11:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is what I've done up here on the top is there is going to be topics for conversations. So maybe they were talking about something to do with eating, or sleeping, or moving, or the mindset, or coaching, or nudges, or data tracking. So they would just be groups of these chats. And so we would filter by that, because in theory, each one of those blue boxes responds to a microbot or a microagent, which is focused on a particular area.

12:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

12:29 - Jorge Lewis 
But OK, let's backtrack a bit. Let's stay on the topic of the other ones. So the user interface that we're thinking what we're going to do is have it so that you cop. So if you go back to slide two. Here, the context is going to be, there's flying ants everywhere.

12:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So we were thinking you're going to copy the text from the chat room and then paste it into here for the examples that you think are good or bad.

13:02 - Jorge Lewis 
But the way you've described your solution makes it sound like you really want to be grinding these out, right? Like for every single message.

13:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, what you could have then, let me just see if I understand. So this is a record of, I mean, let's say this is the last, this is just a log of all of the messages.

13:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I would, actually, let me just get rid of that. And let's say these are going to just go into Amber.

13:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then here is, I'm just going to call it process. I've got no idea what that means yet. So there's a page here of all chats. This is just an audit log of all chats. And I'm going, right, OK, this one here, I don't know this one. I'm going to process this. I process it. It takes me to this page.

14:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Once I've saved it, it will be available here in process chats. So let's say this one I've done wrong. It's actually it's overly influencing it I can obviously go in and edit it or I could delete it. But this is basically a list of unprocessed chats. I see Would you be able to filter this by topic? Would we do this by user? Maybe because it could be as we scale the users that could be quite noisy. But yeah, I mean you could Do you know this? This is all obviously not necessarily for day one, but I think it just gives an idea. So this is by user.

14:37 - Jorge Lewis 
It's good. It's good. Yeah. Let me think.

14:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
By date. And then these are topics.

14:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is just basically some filtering.

15:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Something like that.

15:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, OK. All right.

15:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that's the flow in my head, where you've got a list of all chats. We decide which ones we want to pick up to process. You process. You go in here. You figure out what's good, bad, more of this, less of this, whatever the right feels are. And then this would be a page of reviews.

15:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So like the screenshot I sent, the second one I sent, right? Like that one. It's going to be the exact same as what I sense under slide three.

15:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So slide three, yes. With a few different fields, but yeah. Yeah, OK. That's the same as this one here with the 10.

15:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, gotcha. So OK, so that part's good. The list, the viewing them and managing them is just CRUD. So just being able to add, remove, and yep. Yeah, the the one that's more concerning is the other one. So the other one three, so So for three, yeah, so three before you process There's a couple that's just same as this page from a UI point of view. It's just unprocessed ones yeah, so from the from the UI point of view, but there's a couple things that I'm The number one concern is context. Right now, we most likely will not be using anything other than the direct message before it, or the series of messages before it, since the last bot's response. But later down the road, we might require context for the bot to be able to use the data more efficiently. And to just solve that, we could add a buffer of negative 10 to just get the last 10 messages.

16:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
It depends on where do you pull the thread on a conversation, because actually the seventh response to the sixth message might actually be really dependent on the first question. So the context might actually be all messages. It's not just one line.

17:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think the best we can do for storing context for data, it's just purely data store or data managed for long term, is to just get the previous 50 messages or maybe that's too much, but we can shorten it, but we'll never be able to give the data once it's gone through this system. So probably 50 just to start. And then the other concern is that if you're looking through it here, it's going to be, if you're looking, so let's suppose this is just an unfiltered chat log for all the users. The first message and the second message might not, like, you might require some context to understand if a message is, if the response is good. Obviously, we need the, for sure, we need the message before and then the bot's message.

18:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but the messages here would always have to be at minimum by user, because these are conversations. So the conversation that I have is contextual. I can't just see a stream of every single message by time. That would make no sense. So by user is a default grouping. You could only ever see a conversation by a person. You wouldn't be able to see it by everybody. That would make no sense.

18:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's always at least one user. And you can just filter by user. And then days could be today, tomorrow, all time. And then you have by topic. So these are the three. Actually, I was clicking on the wrong screen. So those three at the top are actually the, let me just move these all the way over there.

19:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's that date, let's call that purple, and let's call this pink. So those topics are, the blues are just topics. By date will be by date, and by user, by user.

19:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that could work.

19:29 - Jorge Lewis 
These are just filters on the chats.

19:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, then the concern would be how do we check if the response has been added already, if that specific response.

19:44 - Jorge Lewis 
What does that mean? Say that again.

19:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, let's say you're reviewing one user's chat log and there's A bad example up here and then another bad example down there. You want to mark, you want to be able to analyze them both because you don't want the first one to happen and you don't want the second one to happen. And to, to, we can't do them at the same time because the LLM would be, that'd be too confusing for it. So we're using this system. Hmm.

20:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Okay. So for each bot message, we'll just add a property for if it's been, um, reviewed or not.

20:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. But are you saying like, there's one, one, the first problem is scope. Like if I've had a 15 minute conversation with the boss, right. You could basically say a conversation is the first boundary. And a conversation is something that has had, I'm being crude now, but let's say if there's been no updates in five minutes, let's consider the conversation finished as an example.

21:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Or if you said, has the question been answered? So there'll be some level of discernment that a conversation is finished. So within a conversation, you could have good things and bad things. So you might want to, let's say there's 25 messages in a conversation. There might be bits of the conversation that you want to reinforce as positive. And there might be bits of the conversation that you want to reinforce as corrected, needs to be corrected. So by that, within a conversation, you might need to be able to break it up into sections and go, right, this bit is good, this bit's corrective.

21:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
But I don't think you want to be able to have a piece of the conversation being identified as both good and corrective. So therefore, a sentence Let's say, Converse, that the lines 20 to corrective, but they need lines one to 10 context.

22:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's actually, for us, it doesn't sound like it makes sense, but I think it would, because LMs are really good at being very tunnel-visioned. So if we're telling them very strictly, here's the context, which includes entire conversation, and then reiterate, this is what we're looking at, they won't learn from the context. They'll be only focusing on the example we're referring to, the corrective or good one.

22:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, maybe actually you look at the conversation and you are able to say, the introduction was really good, but the second half of the conversation was bad, or it could have gone better.

22:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I think now that we're separating each bot into different, or let's make a term here. So we have the chatbot.

23:10 - Jorge Lewis 
let's call them modules. So in this case, we have the sleep module, the move module, nudges, blah, blah, blah. Each one should have its, they're all going to undertake the same personality and the same tone of voice. There are so many, there's the answer falling out of my hair now. They're all going to take the same personality prompts, all of the human prompts, and then the rest are going to be more specific. That way, we get a lot of fine-grained control, and we don't have to do what we're explaining here, where we have to say, in this conversation, the intro was good, but this one wasn't. We just have to say, this response was unacceptable. This is how we fix it. But yeah.

23:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's probably going to be some form of base prompt, which is tone. I don't know.

24:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
brevity, like do we do verbose, non-verbose? And again, this could be by topic, it could be, you know, we can refine the base prompt, which is available for everything. But again, there's also We talked about one person being responsive to an Arnold Schwarzenegger in your face personality, as opposed to the cheerleader. So that would just be, a user might choose that, but that's something for later. I don't think that's part of the first, what we're doing today.

24:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I think it might be better on our side, we're going to do that to help us. Because right now, to be able to test some of the things we're implementing, we need to test the bot. And of course, if it's telling us absolute horseshit, then it's useless. So we're actually going to kind of start you off and provide some prompting. So I guess we can start with that.

25:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I can't say his name. We'll start with, we could try his personality.

25:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

25:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Um, yeah, for the, for the UI, I'll run it again. Um, on, have you, have you used Excalibur by the way?

25:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Have I used what?

25:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Excalibur.

25:30 - Jorge Lewis 
No, what's that?

25:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Nah, it's like a... It's a whiteboard, I guess.

25:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we use Miro and stuff like that.

25:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Excalibur, I really like it because it has a perfect blend of features and simplicity, because the other ones are just too... They have too much features, so if they feel, like, too bloated and slow, this one helps me because it doesn't align things and give you the grid lines and everything, which is good, because if not, I spent too much time trying to align things and all that.

25:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, I'll have both of them.

26:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so that's what I'm going to use. So I'll make, I'll make another little mock-up and then give it to you and we can double check that.

26:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need some food.

26:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yep. Sounds good, man. Take care. Good night.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (37).txt"

Fri, May 31, 2024

0:15 - Eksno 
Bad lighting here.

0:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey guys.

0:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
How's the how's the summer it's been much better now Is it is this name Jorge or Jorge Yes So it's pronounced Jorge, but people struggle so he says you can call me Jorge.

0:55 - Eksno 
I If you ask his dad, it'll be Jorge. If you ask his mom, it'll be Jorge. I think.

1:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're in, Jorge?

1:07 - Eksno 
Yeah. Can you guys hear me?

1:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

1:12 - Eksno 
Cool.

1:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

1:13 - Eksno 
Yeah. Just discussing your name, if it was Jorge or Jorge.

1:19 - Eksno 
A complicated one. Yeah.

1:25 - Eksno 
On Discord, you're called Jorge, Jorge, aren't you?

1:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me set up the user for Kuen, by the way. You can start with your local demo, and then I can send it over to Kuen after.

1:41 - Eksno 
Cool. Yeah. One moment.

2:12 - Eksno 
Trying to share my screen. Can you guys see?

2:17 - Eksno 
Yeah. OK, so landing page is just as boring, except there's a new button, Go to Admin. And the Go to Chat is exactly as it was before you can input your profile ID and you'll be able to chat with the bots.

2:38 - Eksno 
On the admin page, we're kind of just making it as like, what was it called? Any units for now. So you'll have like different pages for each thing, but later we'll probably revise and go over how you want the design to be.

2:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just to briefly align on that, what I would imagine is, is there any interplay between each of the pages, or are they completely isolated from each other?

3:08 - Eksno 
They are currently completely isolated.

3:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
But from a technology point of view, would you ever see a point where they might interplay with each other?

3:20 - Eksno 
If they do, it shouldn't be a problem to combine them. That's why we made them like this, so that later we can combine them without having to worry about them colliding currently.

3:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, yeah, maybe JP, you'd have some thoughts on it, but for me, I would just have those as a list on the left-hand side, and as I click, the right-hand side is the area that I'd work in, and I

3:43 - Jorge Lewis 
can see the other ones. Like a navigation side map.

3:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Just a very simple side map, yeah.

3:49 - Jorge Lewis 
we haven't worried about the UI yet, but I think that's the solution for every kind of POC.

3:54 - Eksno 
We made this in like one minute just to have it so I could have a page for each thing. Then there's the edit system prompts. This one is shared between everyone, so when you edit here it'll be the prompt that every one gets. Here I just have the current prompts. So yeah, it's pretty basic. You can go in here and edit the system prompt that supports like some headers and, oops, apparently control C also works. I'm glad I didn't intend or intentionally make it.

4:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how does one use this? Like you have a section here called responsibilities.

4:42 - Eksno 
This is just plain text like prompts that is passed directly to the AI. The prompt is just something I used or something I made with AI. It's not crafted at all.

4:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Apart from technology for a moment, as a user, what do I need to do to put useful information in here?

5:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
If I put something in here, what impact does that have on the bot in terms of it engaging with the customer? Is this its personality? Is this the scope? Is this the type of answers, the explicit answer? Because what I don't want to do is have explicit answers because that's just a messaging system and that's not what we want to do.

5:31 - Eksno 
So this will... Do you want to explain, Jorge, maybe?

5:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, it's all of the above, really.

5:40 - Eksno 
Yeah, but except explicit answer examples, we'll be using reg for. But this is basically where you craft the core of the bots. This is like the core instructions that the bot is given, if that makes sense.

5:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So for example, we could, we could, we could separate the, the different aspects you mentioned, like personality, the, the stylish respond if we wanted to. But I mean, of course that's just, you can tell us to do that and we'll do that. But right now we cannot, we put all those things into here. And for the other things, whereas like you will have an example that you'd like, you can use that to, to strengthen it. That's where the

6:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
But it's, it's so, you know, as a user, like if I was to give this to my wife to say, right, you can now play with the boss. Like, because it's, there's no structure to it. We have to have some sort of guidelines and saying, right, there's good practices to have a, like, I don't know what you say, responsibilities, requirements is not really a, I understand that the definition of the word, but I don't understand the applicability of the word and the context of what we're trying to do here. So I wouldn't know how to put something in here and make it useful for me.

6:58 - Eksno 
What I'd suggest is just completely getting rid of this prompt, since this prompt is AI generated, except the last part where it describes how it should be shutting, and crafting it from the bottom up.

7:15 - Jorge Lewis 
But what we could do to help Jonas is give him like a baseline of separating, because there's best practices for prompting, you know, define its personality, the style of writing, the length of the writing, all this stuff that we can use. I mean, I feel like you guys probably know some things like regarding this, since you guys have used ChatGPT quite a bit, but we could separate those into different text editors.

7:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't know how good I am, but I understand how to get better things from chat GPT these days, where you say, act as this person, act as this type of a role. I'm having this context, but there's certain, if you look at some of the things that we've looked at in the past, there will be different, categories or different sections to fill in, that if you fill in these X sections, you're going to have a better prompt than if you don't have them. So I could have a prompt right now that just says, be nice. And that is a totally valid prompt. I don't think it's very effective here. So we need help to understand what are all of the categories of inputs that is going to make this more effective. Tone of response. Great. OK. Well, we've already said that we might want to have multiple tones, because somebody might want the Arnold Schwarzenegger or the cheerleader. That's fine. For now, we could just have a tone category. We would have a things you never talk about category. Like if someone says, hey, I had an abortion last week. Should I do this workout? I'm like, I'm sorry. You need to go and speak to a doctor. So we would want to be able to say things to stay away from, things to go on about. I think it just needs some more guidance and it's too nebulous at the moment to say anything. JP, you're probably better at prompting than I am. I wonder whether you've got thoughts on this.

9:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
Again, I'm relatively new, although I do have an idea. Would we put If you go to list what to talk about, what not not to talk about, would you have that in a separate document and then refer to it from the base prompt?

9:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we could just separate them into different, different text editors to keep it simple for you guys. Like, so one of the texts, one of the text fields would be the The style. One of them would be a list of things. Do not talk about like that. Would that work?

9:52 - Jonathan Phillips 
I don't know the best way of doing it, and obviously management wise, if the list is sort of thousands of lines long for what not to say, would you have that, would it be better in a document or would it be better just as part of the prompt itself?

10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
either if the list is thousands of lines long, then document. But if it's not, then the text editor.

10:18 - Jonathan Phillips 
I mean, just to have things in separate documents, it sounds easier to manage that way than have it just in one text file and then leave that to more of the sort of descriptive type of thing for personality, for tone, for direction, for general emphasis of what you're trying to do. I don't know. I don't know. That's what I would do.

10:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So for that one, you'd have all of the different categories in text files or documents. Yeah. The only downside with that is you wouldn't be able to change or it would be harder to change the text or the prompt on the fly. So like, let's say you're practicing with a bot and he says something that He shows behavior that you really don't like and you want to change it easily. With a text editor, it's a lot easier than changing the document, exporting and uploading it again.

11:10 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, because when I played with, I think it was Dante's, they had a base prompt and documents. It struggled sometimes to locate things in documents and I didn't have time to play with it too stringently or get feedback from them why things were and weren't working. So I don't know if it's better to load up the base prompt infinitely or to have it separately managed within documents.

11:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I think the approach of just separating them into different categories works, we can see from there. Because the main ideas, or there's a couple of things we're talking about here. We're talking about what's more efficient and more functional, like for the bot, and then also what's easier for Cuan and his wife to use as a user interface.

11:53 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sure. I mean, I'm all about it. Yeah, I'm all about the accuracy, ultimately, for where, obviously, what it interrogates when you put a prompt in, when you question it, the user questions it, what's the most efficient and effective way of getting the data and then manipulating it. If there's no difference, then it's just a semantic sort of organizational job, which is fine. That's not a problem at all. Obviously, we don't know which is the best way.

12:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

12:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think we'll go ahead and kind of separate it by the different categories, just best practices, you know, personality, like responsibilities, tone, things to never talk about.

12:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, for now, just in that text editor, if you basically can give me all of the categories.

12:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. That's even faster, yeah.

12:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
That will just allow us to start playing with it and figuring out, OK, this is not working, that's not working. And then as we start playing with it, we need to figure out what the needs of the interface will be. But yeah. Sorry, I just want to check something. So if I use the bot today, is there an ability to see the chat log and then say, no, don't do that, do this? Is that feature available yet?

13:21 - Eksno 
Like telling the bot, don't do that? Or how do you mean?

13:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
My understanding is that once the bot starts something, we have a conversation and it's dialoguing. It may not be responding in the way that we would like, So we would want to say, no, no, that's not a good answer. This is a better answer. Or don't say that, say this. So that's the training, that's what I'm labeling training of the bot. Is that something that we can do?

13:54 - Eksno 
That is not implemented yet. It'll be, how it'll work is you'll, when you get a bad answer to a question, what you do is copy the question into the admin page, where you'll go to an examples section, which will use a rag to pull out. Because I imagine over time, there's going to be a lot of examples. So you enter samples into that. That's a long list. We'll have to make the UI for that. It's not implemented yet. But one of this, you just give examples there. You don't live do it in the conversation. So maybe we could implement three dots and correct the answer, and then it automatically submits it. The UI can be done in many ways.

14:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So again, I can see some progress, but I'm not entirely sure what I can do. That make sense? I'm seeing some buttons on the screen, but I don't know, as a user, what I can actually Currently, you can just edit the core system prompt, which is inherently the last process.

15:12 - Eksno 
So everything, no matter what process you use, eventually gets compiled into a system prompt. That's a system prompt. Moving forward, we're going to be building on top of it, whether it's just separating it into categories that have been prompted properly, or using Reg to add more context in the system prompt.

15:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's probably a single use case that I think we should try and coalesce around so that we're actually, we have a tight context by which we're testing things. So the end of day check-in, for example. So what will be useful to have is, right, a number of people, me, JP, all of you guys, whatever, each person, here's our, the categories of things that we're tracking, eat, move, mind, sleep, and what our daily actions are. And then say, right, let's just say I press a button. It knows it's me. And I'll say, I want to do my daily check-in. OK. So again, I know that we would instigate it for now rather than it instigating it based on time. That will come later. And it would go to my profile. It'll see what I have or have not completed, and it will have a conversation around doing that. Because that's a very real use case that we can then refine the bot. Because at the moment, it's just a bot, and there's no context by which I'm engaging it. Does that make sense?

16:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

16:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I saw you said you had a profile number there. What does that profile number actually do? Does that link to a user's profile with certain things? I mean, even if it was two actions hard-coded for now, that we can start getting into the dialogue, then that will be super useful.

17:02 - Eksno 
OK.

17:04 - Eksno 
So what we've been focusing on is mainly getting all the foundation behind the bots that it'll need to be able to complete So we haven't implemented any UI for entering how many calories you've eaten or anything like that yet. What do you think, Jorge?

17:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I have a question. If I'm not mistaken, I think with like... Two more hours of work, we could have it in the state where he's able to run using his profile ID to run the run and then change the system prompt, I think.

17:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Right?

17:39 - Eksno 
That's how it's currently.

17:41 - Jorge Lewis 
It's currently like that, right? Yeah. So the system prompt is connected to his account already, right?

17:49 - Eksno 
Yeah. It's global system prompt. Everyone shares it.

17:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Basically go to my profile and see whether I tracked my daily walk, yes or no, distance and time. And what did I track my calories for the day? Just look at those two simple action items. And I have an interface where I can put in data. So I can say that one time it's food, and one time I've done my walk. So I'm going to have it. I can run the scenario. And I'll say, cool, OK, so you haven't done your thing today. Did you do your walk? Yeah, OK, great. OK, fine. So we can have that conversation. I think that will be really useful to try and start testing this. Because otherwise, it doesn't know anything about the context of what we're trying to achieve.

18:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, OK. So that's a practical example you want to start working around, right?

18:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think so. I think having a specific use case, I think is super useful.

18:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you tell me the two items again so I can write them down?

18:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So having my profile and then under eat, it's how many calories did you eat today? It's a simple one. And under move, did you do your walk? How much, what distance did you cover? How long did you walk for? Just those bits of information. Now, let's say I go in and I enter in yes to my walk, but I didn't fill in the other two. Then it would ask me about those two. I would say, hey, I want to do my daily check-in. That means I go to the profile. I see what they have or haven't done. I come back to you and I say, right, how was your walk today? And okay, cool. And so we'd have that conversation going backwards and forwards.

19:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, okay.

19:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm confused who you're saying you and me. Are you acting as the bot here?

19:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, I will converse with the bot.

19:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

19:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me say that again because I didn't realize that I was changing identifiers. So I would expect to go into an interface and see my name and then these three action items or tracker items, yeah?

20:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
As a user, not as an admin.

20:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
As me, as a user. No, sorry, as an admin for now. But this is just testing. This is not end case at all, right? So they would be blank for this scenario. If I then went to the bot and say, I want to check in today. Now I'm as a customer. And the bot goes, it will go to my profile. It will see that there's nothing in the three trackers. And it will say, cool. Do you know what you track your calories today? No. OK, that's a shame. Tell me what you've eaten or whatever. Figure that out. Or you say, did you do your walk today? No. OK, what does that mean? Or yes. OK, what distance did you do? OK, fine. And then it'll update the profile. Because that loop is, in essence, what we're doing at scale and more refinement. And then, and I know we're not doing multi-message updates at this point, but that That allows me to test the context of this and then gives me a reason to go, right, okay, I'm going to change the persona, the prompt, I'm going to rerun the scenario and I'll see a different experience. That allows me then to go in and change the prompt and see an impact in a very tight construct.

21:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, makes sense. So we can work on making that one of the priorities. So that you can start playing with a practical kind of capability.

21:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, at the moment, it's like, I'm not, there's nothing I can imagine.

21:27 - Jorge Lewis 
You can use it, but there's no practical, like there's, yeah, okay, I get it.

21:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
With all of these things, I think until you have the context of a use case, it's very difficult to assess it.

21:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

21:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, for the, for the global, for the global prompt, is it, so that's everyone that's using it right now will have the same one?

21:48 - Eksno 
Yeah.

21:51 - Eksno 
So I can separate that, but when I asked about it last time, I think you said you wanted your wife and you to both be able to edit the same one, so you wanted it to be global and not user-bound, the system prompt.

22:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
The system prompt, well, again, I think what's more important at the moment is that we have the context in which we can test something under whatever is the least amount of work to get that done, whether it's global or user-based.

22:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
but the experience is bestowed to a user.

22:25 - Jorge Lewis 
The thing is, we can't play around with anything if we're changing, like if you and your wife are working with some, trying to experiment a little capability, we can't go in right now and change it ourselves. So Jonas, separate it by profile and we can tell them to use the same profile ID.

22:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

22:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

22:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how feasible, how long will it take You guys to do this next sort of bit of change because there's no point me playing with it today Until we had these other contacts To go over it's the we're gonna

23:00 - Jorge Lewis 
have the we're gonna have the bots to we can leave out some of the Because there's the bots knowing the profile Stats pretty much and then there's the bot having to mmm I think probably by next week. What do you think, Jonas?

23:22 - Eksno 
Yeah, the bio is already prompting the user about the four items. But it's kind of doing it just out of whim. It's not doing it in a structured fashion. So the main part of it would be structuring the daily check or the check-in, and also having it get information from the website tracker.

23:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we did set up the profile, the tracking.

23:48 - Eksno 
Yeah, the profile page, basically.

23:51 - Jorge Lewis 
And then just connecting it to that bar. So yeah, next week, easily.

23:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so just some feedback in terms of how we're working. And this is just, there's no blame here, but I think certainly my expectations of what I'd be able to do today and what I am able to do today are not aligned. So I think we need to do a better job of getting aligned on what is actually going to be feasible at the end of every week. Because we can see progress, that's fine. But it's just, it's a challenge when, you know, I've got stakeholders who are going, oh, yeah, yeah, great. And I say, yeah, I think we should be able to play with it this week. Technically, yes, you can play with it, but there's no context. So it's not really usable. I wouldn't give it to my wife or my sister, because I think they'd just get lost, and they would just get frustrated, and it would give them a disappointing experience, which I want to prevent. We also said two weeks in that this would be potentially a branching point where JP's work could start on the back of what we've built. It also doesn't feel like we're any way close to that yet. So can we just sort of reset expectations of how do you, I mean, do you think things are going slower or faster than you thought or as expected? Because that is just my, it's a calms gap as opposed to a progress gap.

25:18 - Jorge Lewis 
I would say slower for sure. Jonas got sick over the weekend. My stomach wasn't doing so well. So for the expectations, I'd say we were on track until then. It wasn't, the best scenario but I think I think what we can't because our expectations were probably accurate but what we conveyed to you was probably the problem so more more communication regarding what you can do within the app and then we tell you what you can do and you ask us what about this can I do this and we'll say yes or no because if we tell you what you can do and then we say okay perfect

25:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
then there's probably a big chance for miscommunication there Yeah, just from a, again, from a customer point of view, the early days were great. There was a lot of backwards and forwards, a lot of conversations. At the moment, there's very little conversation during the week. I sort of instigate stuff, you guys go off and do your stuff, and I get that. I'm not trying to micromanage you and I'm not trying to look over your shoulders, but I think there is, it feels like the possibility for a divergence is much greater because we're not really checking in. And I think that's evidence in the last two weeks in terms of what you've delivered on the Friday has not been aligned to what was in my head. Again, not blaming, just saying that there's a communication gap. So I'd like to figure out how we make that a little bit tighter.

26:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, what do you think about maybe bi-daily text updates? Because in terms of capabilities, it's not every day that there's a new capability that Cuan can work on, but perhaps just the items we're working on. Would that work?

27:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Not twice a day, every two days.

27:11 - Eksno 
For up to now, what we've mainly been working on is the foundation of the application, the foundation of the AI, getting all the capabilities in. For me, it's aligned with expectations because we haven't been focusing on everything on top.

27:29 - Eksno 
to place on top. All of those are things that will rapidly come later throughout the process.

27:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

27:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So the issue is that we didn't convey that properly with Cuan then, because he was expecting something else. So that is our fault then.

27:53 - Jorge Lewis 
So do you think doing an update every two days would work, Jonas?

28:00 - Eksno 
Yeah, but I won't always have too much say, like every two days, but yeah.

28:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, I appreciate that when we get to a point where we're building more sort of features rather than foundations, those updates are going to be more obvious and useful. What I think in this phase is more useful is actually getting really, really clear and having some record of a visual will be delivered. So for example when you just say the words You'll be able to play with this next week. And I was like, oh. And I then got potentially carried away with what that actually means. It's not a tightly bound defined object in terms of play means this, not that, but this. And actually, if you're going to play with it, what's actually useful? What's an actual useful thing? So I think if we can do a use case, what I'll do after this is I'll write down in the Discord what I would like it. The thing, so there's a couple of things that once I can do these things, it becomes useful. Not fully functional, but it becomes useful. And the question I need from you guys is when will that be achieved? That might be, it could be on Wednesday, it could be Wednesday next week. So we don't, even though we are working two week in weekly focuses, sometimes things will happen outside of the scope of that. And then the other question, just while we have JP here, is when the world of multi-agent seems to be taking off, and it's just all we're seeing now. When do you guys think you can start looking at JP's solution not wanting to necessarily I mean do we slow down adapt in order to start JP are they both sort of inextricably linked on the first phase and then once you've built enough foundation we can pivot eyes like what's the what's the exercise there I can't hear you Jorge is that just me I think I Yeah, I was saying that I'd probably hop on to the dev bandwagon,

30:17 - Jorge Lewis 
spend probably half of my time there for story.

30:22 - Jorge Lewis 
It wouldn't slow down either project. I think they're still, if we did one, it would be the same speed as if we did both.

30:31 - Jorge Lewis 
But as how soon we can get it done, if the spec that we sent over looks good and there's nothing seems to be missing, then we can start prototyping.

30:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Yeah.

30:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Should we leave it there then? If you guys can send over the publicly available, I'll just have a play with what's there anyway, just to see it. And then I'll spec out this afternoon or in the next hour or so once I eat some food, I'll spec out what I think is a useful set of use cases. And once I can do those things, then you can tell me when you think And sometimes where I've gone, it needs to do this. And you're like, well, actually, we could do a hard-coded version that allows you to get to the same outcome without having the finished interface, for example. So I welcome the challenge to figure out alternate ways of getting there quicker.

31:34 - Eksno 
Yeah, sounds good.

31:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks, folks.

31:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Appreciate it. And for JP, we'll get started over the weekend on Monday. Just kick off do the official kickoff by Monday. How does that sound to you? I'll send the contract over probably if Let's get take another look at the spec make sure that it's all good. And then we can once I get the final Okay, I'll send the contract over.

31:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Sure. I'll do that this afternoon for you Cool.

31:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks so much JP. Thanks for your time""","Meet Meeting Transcript (38).txt"

1:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hello.

3:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Can't hear you now.

4:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
you.

5:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
you Silence.

6:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
I tried to call them, but I couldn't get an answer.

6:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

7:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey Matt, how are you?

7:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, now I can't hear you.

7:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me confirm my... Okay, are you there?

7:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, can you hear me? Yes, I can.

7:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see me?

7:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can see and hear.

7:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

7:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry about that. No worries. I think there's a very big line though.

8:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think your picture and your audio are very disconnected.

8:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

8:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

8:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is it in sync? Better.

8:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think so. Okay, cool. How's Trix? What part of the world are you still in, Vietnam?

8:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm at my buddy's place again.

8:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice. Cool.

8:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so, um, yeah, I wanted just to see whether, um, you know, we're just give you some background. So myself and Arif, we've been in consulting and product development in some form or another using AI, machine learning, more not generative AI, what you're doing, but more on the machine learning data science side for years in consulting and UK government. And we joined a telco in September to try and figure out what's next, like to transform the whole face of telcos. The guy that brought us in and sort of sold us a bit of a dream on our three-year engagement, he got fired in January.

9:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
They're doing a massive reorganization and we're probably going to be leaving. And so we're trying to figure out what's next. And while we've been doing that, we've been starting to have conversations with people to say, you know, like with you guys, I've gone down the AI rabbit hole for the last four months. And I think a lot of clients don't have a fucking clue what it means, what the opportunities are, what the threats are. And we're doing, we've started, we've offered like in the last week, we've offered five people that we know, five companies. Hey, can we come in for an hour and talk? We'll talk to you about AI, demystify it for you, identify actual applicable business cases, because there's a huge amount of novelty in AI. Like, create a stupid picture. Hey, fun, fun. And then go back to work. There's obviously huge risks with it as well. And most people don't know what to do, and they're really struggling. And so this is an area that we're excelling in, and we're speaking with people about it. We'll be starting our first sort of sessions next week.

10:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
We're trying to figure out, maybe this is what we do. We go deep on it. Now, one of the things that's coming out of these conversations is people are going, oh, could you prototype something for us? I was like, the answer is, yeah, we could. We know people as well. Now, there's a simple relationship, which is basically we just give people over to you. That feels like a missed opportunity for us in terms of cultivating this. Also, there's, We work at consultancies where we're 10,000 pounds a day to a client. So your rates going into them, they wouldn't work with you because you're not expensive enough. You would have no gravitas with them. And those prices, if you charge their prices to me, we would have never done business with you because we can't afford it. So there has to be this sort of spectrum and dynamic pricing based on the client's you know, reality. I was just chatting to Arif about it. He's off this week. It's half term over here. So he takes every half term off to spend time with the kids. I mean, we're just thinking, like, we would, you know, we reckon, as a bit of an experiment, we reckon over the next three months, we're going to be hitting an awful lot of business from a consulting point of view around AI. We're sort of trying to figure out, could we make a go of that rather than going in and working for some other fucking prick again and making, as I've said for years, I've just been making fat white men richer, and I'd rather not. There is a, without going into detail, because I'm under NDA, I can't talk about something. There is a, there's an opportunity. So a friend of mine that I used to work with is an advisor to a president in one of the African countries. So he hasn't been the president for the last four years, and the new election- Which countries?

12:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
African?

12:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's an African country, I'm not allowed to say which one. But there's an election in December, and right now he has a 50% poll, and the next nearest candidate is 25%. So the odds are that he's going to be shoehorned in. Now they have secured, well they have petitioned the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, for 20 million in training. So to retrain the entire government in a new way of working, which is where I'm potentially going to get involved in. But we have an entity over here called GDS, the Government Digital Service. So they are the entire digital arm of the UK government. And we're in conversations about setting that up for this government in Africa. And if we do it there, they're looking at getting a lot of the president's talk. So again, that could be absolutely nothing, or it could be unbelievably something. And they want to figure out, how do we elevate AI and then apply it at the governmental level? And again, once you start getting into sovereign wealth funds, it's a different ballgame in terms of autonomy and ability to do. Hopefully our issue becomes one of scale, not one of application and knowledge. So there's a lot of stuff happening. Again, nothing may come of it or something may come of it. It's hard to promise. But yeah, I was chatting to Ira the other day and I said, as I said, ups and what is, we just give you the business. And that feels like, as I said, a missed opportunity for us. And so I wanted to see whether it'd be something, whether you'd be interested in exploring a partnership, a more strategic partnership. If there's interest and I think we need to figure out the details of that, what does that actually mean? How does that actually work in reality? From just a strategic partnership on paper to potentially we could look at doing some investment. We're not millionaires, so you're not going to get a million.

14:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
There is some money that we could potentially put in as an investment to take equity ownership in you guys. JP as well as marketer, we could deploy him to start marketing the capability and getting it out there. I think there's a purple patch of opportunity right now where I think Aram's brother, he was an agile trainer for years. And just because every company said, oh, you need to have a piece of paper called a certification, he just stood in a river of demand going, I can give you those pieces of paper. And he made a lot of money that way. I think there's some flavor of that happening right now with AI.

15:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think there is a bit like the NFT hype cycle. There was a massive proliferation of ideas and tools, and then most of them couldn't sustain themselves, and they end up collapsing. We're having the same night. There's so many white labeling, low-code, no-code platforms out there now. They're not all needed. They're just not. They all end up doing the same thing. So there'll be a consolidation in that play as well. I'm not a fan of no code, low code, because I think you hit glass ceilings.

15:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think you can. If you want to do really basic, rapid prototyping, I think that's fine. If you want to do any level of innovation, I don't think they're sufficient. I don't think it works.

16:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it all depends on the use case like we we had a new person come into the Low code, low code. So he knew, he was very good friends with the owner of builder.ai which is now a multi-billion dollar company. How, I'm not entirely sure, but it is.

16:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
And yeah, and what we couldn't, what we were struggling for him to get across to him is like, you know, that's fantastic if you want to do clone of Facebook, clone of Instagram, like something that's already there, you can do them really quickly. However, if you're truly doing something innovative, like you have to have the ability to do code. So like, for example, Let's say every app you have has an account profile page. Yeah, but you can get that from Bootstrap. You don't need to have a no-code, no-code environment for those common reusable components. They're readily available everywhere now. So why tie yourself into this ecology of this platform that will currently curtail you at some point if you want to be innovative? If you don't want to be innovative, then I've got to ask the question, why are you doing it? But that's a philosophical question. Yeah, I just wanted to sort of throw this out there and see whether this is something that you guys would consider or whether it's not something that you're considering at this time.

18:40 - Jorge Lewis 
How would you imagine it would look?

18:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's do something slightly a different use case. So the guy I met yesterday, he runs a company that I'm starting to network and interview just to see if I want to have another job plus hedging my bets. And I talked to him about what I'm doing with Adapt, what we're doing with Story. And he's like, oh, I've got an idea. Would you refer me to the guys that you think are good and you trust? And I'm like, Yeah, sure. So two things. One, I actually don't want to because there's a risk that you slow down on adapt and story because you've got a huge team. So I don't want to touch on that. Secondly, I'm like, I'm curious. There's another idea that I, I was speaking to somebody who used to work with the European commission and he wants something prototyped as well.

19:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a balance, right? Because you and I, to a level, play similar roles in terms of that business analysis, product ownership, figuring out what the product is. I'm at a different stage of my career than you are. So my time is more expensive because of where I live. So in certain cases, I think you would do it or I would do it as a last leader to grow the company. But I think the same as you start putting more people on the table, you start having more cost.

20:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
to figure out the dynamics of it. But I think for the right clients, like if we're opening up a big consultancy company, then they'll tolerate our rights. So that wouldn't be an issue. And again, you're building a prototype to try and get the follow-on business. That's where the real money will come in. And actually, where we'd like to try and do, we would do, have you ever heard of build, operate, transfer?

20:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
transfer.

20:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you basically say to people, right, what we're going to do is we are going to hire a AI team for you and a team of software engineers that build AI capability. We will train them. And then when you are ready, we will transfer them to your P&L. So they will become employees of the company. We would set them up in still best practices It's a lot of managed service companies do that rather than just say, we'll pay you for five years, actually. When we started our last role, we didn't know whether we were going to be there a month or 10 years. So actually hiring people and taking on an employment contract and liability was not ideal. So we actually did, we engaged with the company. We said, right, build us a team. You're not going to give us people. You're going to put candidates in front of us and we will hire them. We will make the decision on whether they're hired or not. But you will have the employment rights, we will not. And then if we're here in a year, two years, and we feel that there's longevity in the function, then we will move them over. We would have the rights to do that. But in the meantime, you're going to make your margin and your day rates based on headcount. So there's pretty good money on HowCamp because you also don't have delivery responsibility. You're just TNN time materials. So it's up to the client to manage delivery in that regard. So you're literally buying capability and we're assuring quality. So there's that model as well, and I think we've got access to a very good recruiter, he's ex-meta, he's found some really good people for us very quickly in the past, he's very good at doing that. So we've got that, got you guys in terms of AI expertise. There's a big consultancy called Slalom. They've met a couple of account manager salespeople, redundant, that I'm just speaking to. I've just had a message from one there now. So they want to do, he's another prototype, they want to do, so they install sprinkler systems. Into companies. So the company just did one for the Apple, the new Apple building in London. And they had to turn, they don't have enough, they didn't have enough people. They turned down a 5 million pound deal for the new Google office. And I'm like, you should never turn down 5 million pounds, like ever. There's no criteria for ever doing that. Now, they want to use AI to basically say, right, if you tuck in the schematics of a building, Could AI do the first pass allocation of where the fire sprinkler systems need to be? And then visual generative AI, like if you walked around the building, could it do actually safety checks? I mean, the cross sell on this is fucking amazing. And it's just a really cool innovation.

24:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
if they are the ones who are instilling all of the fire sprinkler systems, and we know what fire regulations are, like doors, distance, stuff like this, could we do real-time safety checks on buildings based on generative AI as an example? So again, the issue there is liability. If you get it wrong, people die. So your insurances are pretty big. And also, I love sleeping at night. I don't like jobs that keep me awake at night. So like anything to do with arms, tobacco, I tend not to get involved in.

24:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
We have an opportunity actually to work with a company, it's a private wealth fund. And they own all of the McDonald franchises in a part of Europe. And Arif's going to be leading that engagement. I mean, they've got a double sales in five years. I mean, that's a huge technology opportunity. But the issue is, from a moral point of view, I don't fucking know if I want to double McDonald's sales anywhere in the world. It's not fucking good. So I have a real issue with that. Yeah, that's fair. They also own farms in Australia, they own jewellers, they've got 70 hotels around Europe, and none of the hotels speak to each other. They've got nothing. Most of them you've just got to ring up. So there's a lot of really basic hygiene tech stuff, which has nothing to do with AI, but I think AI call centres are going to be a big thing. Even where we are now, Telco, I think There's so much room. There's a huge opportunity if we could do a use case around call center optimization or call centers moving to AI. I just think we need, we come from a, the consulting place that we come from has a strapline, which is when it really matters, because if it doesn't really matter, you don't pay their rates.

26:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
They only get involved in real fucking problems. That clients will pay so you go into a client. You just say we'll take out 20 million of cost and we'll charge you 5 million They go sure Like you're saving me 20. Why wouldn't I give you five? It's a dumb dumb question. Yeah, and I'll pay you 50 million because you need to turn you need to save my company from going under and you've got three weeks Yeah, that's what they go in and they'll work 18 19 hour days. There's really a fire and they'll save the company and Yeah, it might mean hiring 50% of the people, but it means 50% the people retain their jobs, because if you don't do something, the company's gone. Yeah. So is it a bit of a bit of color about where we are? I mean, there's nothing sort of formal pitch or anything like that to you yet. It's just, this is something that we're, we're interested in. I think this is going to go gangbusters in terms of the market.

27:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
or gangbusters?

27:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So gangbusters is a, I think it comes from, it's a war phrase. It just basically means going all out.

27:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

27:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Gangbusters, I've actually, gangbusters meaning, where does it come from

27:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Basically, it's a classified group of organized criminal gangs. Wow.

27:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
If something's going gangbusters, It's going strongly and doing very well.

27:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think it's just like there is a purple patch of opportunity. And we seem to be pushing against an open door on terms of people saying, I want to know about AI. So we're doing that as a last leader, doing those one-hour talks and educating, give people something.

28:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

28:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

28:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, but the idea is that we would then sell in prototypes or teams or, or something. I, part of that is a sales tool to basically scare the shit out of people and going, you've got no idea what's coming. You really don't have a fucking clue. Um, there's a, there's a website. I don't know if you know about it called, um, real world, real news, no bullshit. And it's some pretty graphic videos. It's unfiltered. Like there was one during the week of this Russian soldier sort of beside a bush, heavily camouflaged. This drone just comes in and basically detonates a small bomb inside, like basically cuts in half. And it's like, this is all, you've now got the Boston Dynamic bots with guns on them. China just did a military exercise driven by drones, not people. And they're doing it at like, you know, fucking thousands and thousands of these things. They're just cranking them out. I mean, it's a really interesting problem. I was reading this morning that only 2% of people in the UK are really using AI actively on a day-to-day basis. Because I don't think they understand how to apply it. And I still think there's a huge risk is that when I get stuff from AI in a subject matter that I know, it's still not perfect. I have to refine it until I'm happy. Where if you didn't, if my wife did it, she'd be like, that looks okay. I'm like, yeah, because you don't know what good looks like, That's the problem. And so I think the, I was reading a really good article today and it says that refrigeration, when it came into America, AI is like refrigeration. Coca-Cola was the product. And because of refrigeration coca-cola grew massively because we could have a cold drink and that basically sales just went skyrocketing so AI is a huge capability it's what products can we build on top of Yeah, exactly. So what would you guys, I mean, obviously, how's your company structure at the moment? Is it just yourself and Jonas that own it?

30:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, currently it's Jonas and I as partners. One of our We're um...

32:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
It depends, right? Give me two seconds. I'm just trying to find something here. Where is it?

32:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just trying to, I'm gonna send you a book that you need to read. There we go.

32:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you have a Kindle? Yeah. I'm gonna send you this book. I would, I would highly, I think you'd really enjoy this book. Have you ever heard of Richard Sheridan or Joy Incorporated?

32:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

32:59 - Jorge Lewis 
No.

33:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I know Richard, he's, uh, he's brilliant. Um, so he, he has a software engineering company, a more traditional software engineering company, um, in Ann Arbor in Michigan. Um, and like, he also added a tweet to say, eh, we're thinking about hiring some new people. People will spend their own money to fly there just to get interviewed by them. So there's a small company in London that we've been working with for years and they are Microsoft Azure specialists. They're the best in the world at it. They're about, when we started with them, they're about eight. There may be 20 people now. They really, really struggled to grow because they know generally a lot of the founders have all had a parent die or have had some medical intervention. So they're very much on work-life balance. They only take on problems that are really complex because they really enjoy fixing complex problems. So they're very selective about what they do, which is good. They've tried three forms of hiring. One, trying to find people like them, so seasoned people, 15 years experience. That's really rare because by the time that you've got very ingrained thoughts, you've got people who are on that journey And then you've got people who are raw talent with no experience. They're finding more success with the raw talent because they don't have any preconceived notions of, so you can't like, it's difficult to retrain somebody. So they're going down that route and that's how they're sort of scaling. And so, yeah, I mean, I would scale with grads and I would just do sort of pair programming with everybody.

34:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So they do exactly.

35:25 - Jorge Lewis 
and fundamentals. Yeah.

35:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, the way Richard, the way we've done it in the past is, um, the interview is 100% chemistry fit.

35:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
And then, yeah.

35:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's just a personality. Is there a, cause listen, you can put two people in a room and they just chalk and cheese that it's not going to get on. And that's just the personalities don't work. You have created a particular vibe between you guys. You do not want someone to come in and poison that. That's the challenge. So that's the cultural chemistry for it. The capability for it is something that you can, you know, fuck someone talking about it, that doesn't work. So the best thing that we've done in the past is that we'll bring somebody in for a week and we'll pay them and say, just work with us for a week. Cause you can't, everyone can fake an interview for an hour. You can't fake work. You just can't. And they have to pair with, multiple people, and you get that feedback. And it's just like, you know, they'll do, you know, do they contribute? Do they not contribute? Do they take over? Do they dominate? And also very useful is pairing with, get two candidates to pair. Because in theory, they're vying for, in their head, they're vying for the same position. So when the pressure comes on, how do they actually behave? Because if they're pairing with Jonas, they're probably going to be showing off It is. And again, you know, one of the things that Richard does is there are plenty of people that they don't believe will be applicable for his company. But the fact that you're there, if they like you, they'll go and find a job for you in one of their clients. People feel very, very cared for. And I think how you manage that process says more about a company than anything else. I was actually speaking to one of our neighbors, and she worked for Deloitte, which is a big consultancy firm. And they had to fire most of their new grad intakes because they'd all lied and had used generative AI to get to the process. Which is fucking, that's more foolish on them. They should be like, that was their process. But that's why I think if someone's not willing to invest a week paid for, it'll filter them out. Yeah, that's a good point.

38:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maintaining so that's why I currently the one concern that I've had with when you say a thousand are you talking about revenue yeah what's your what's your limiting factor on the scale why do you tap out So for me, that's one of the protections. I think you take your problem and you make that an opportunity. So what I've spent the last eight years doing in consultancy is working with very senior partners and helping them figure out what product they need. And then I end up becoming them to the team, so I end up being their proxy. I don't think AI replaces that in the short term. Because they're incredibly time poor and they don't have time to tell somebody what to do. They need someone to interview them, observe them, take them out and go, okay, now I know exactly what you need. Is it this? Yeah, that sounds right. Okay. And then you represent them to the team. Now with that team behind me, is one person with an AI that makes them as effective as 10 people. I don't give a shit. I really don't care. I used to work for an agency called AKQA. So we did all of Coca-Cola's, the happiness campaign, Lynx deodorant, stuff like that. They did the original Xbox interface.

40:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
They, customers, companies buy what they see. They don't give a shit about technology. They just don't. It's necessary for the UX to feel the thing that's tangible to me is the only thing they give a shit about. They don't care about elasticity, uptime, downtime. They're just like, make it work. I don't care. I don't care who's doing it. So I agree with you. I think you, you in particular are probably a bottleneck in terms of working with clients, helping clients define what they want. So that when you're saying, hey, it's going to be X weeks or this amount of money, that you're not screwed by that, because that's the challenge there. Jonas needs to be focused on, actually, what are the patterns that we can create that are reusable so that we can... And again, for example, if you're going to do the fire suppression systems, You probably have no reusable code for that from what you have already. That's a completely innovative field. But there's two parts to it. It's one, what is the client asking for and understanding that. And then it's also dreaming for the client so that you can take their ambition and their vision way beyond what they're doing. It's another area that myself and Arif play in quite well. I love that part as well. So yes, I mean, I think you do have bottles, but I think that's the, you know, you're gonna have phases of growth where you'll reach that limit, that bottleneck and say, right, okay, better to have that problem where we're not able to bring in enough, we're bringing in too much demand. Okay, how do we scale? Scaling is a different problem from delivering software. And I think that's something that, yeah, I mean, you get a good recruitment company around you and you can hire people.

42:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
But that's the problem because it's a signal to noise ratio. There is a lot of shit out there.

43:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
My assumption is that interest rates have been really high so that shuts down the PE world and that's a huge influence on the market in terms of and business and stuff like that, because if people start hiring, people start wanting to present themselves for their own acquisition. It's quite cyclical in that regard. It's a bit of an ecology.

43:35 - Jorge Lewis 
How's the market doing in the UK? Is it the same as the US doing pretty bad?

43:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
I've never really had to find a job, ever. I've just always had a job. Up somebody, go to that job. I was a contractor for 17 years. I was never not in a contract and contracts could be three to 12 months somewhere there. Fair enough. I was willing to travel around Europe and around the world and that was fine.

44:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Everybody I'm saying now is the market's really fucking tough. Really, really tough because people don't know what's around the corner. So people are very nervous. There's also an election here in July, that's going to change things. Interest rates are due to come down, so that will be a stimulus. But yeah, I think everyone's going, it's tough, it's a tough market. It is in traditional markets, but I think in particularly in AI, we seem to be pushing against a message that people want to hear. So yeah, we're just trying to figure out whether, you know, do you guys want to be our sort of execution arm and we form sort of a strategic partnership or it's not the path you guys want to go down and we'll go do it with somebody else.

45:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I mean, I hear that, and...

46:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, you know, the place that we're at now at the moment, I know some people who are suppliers to them and they, they have big dev shops that they work with us. They say that we're absolutely horrible to work for horrible because you just get constantly beaten up, constantly beaten up where when we were in Alex partners, we were very clear. We don't beat people up because we want to have a long-term relationship with them and we want to have a product and we know that product outcomes are not guaranteed. If you want to get something out, test it, iterate on it very quickly. That's the aim of the game. Now, luckily, we have stakeholders that didn't understand that. But trusted us that we were talking the right thing. So yeah, there are good clients and bad clients. I don't think that's true.

47:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't think it's nice.

47:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think it's just like, you've got to have, myself and Aaron have had this thing now where we've made a couple of really shit hires in the years. And both of us at one point felt uneasy in the interview process and didn't tell each other. And had we, we would have said no. So now we basically go, because we're going like, oh, I'm just being an asshole. I'm just a, and now we have a commitment saying, if something's uneasy, we talk about it always. Because if the other person might be doing it as well, we're going, OK, let's double down on that on the next interview and figure out what's making this uneasy. Or we just kill it straight away. And it's put us, I mean, and it feels silly sometimes. But I think you've got to have that sense check of, Is this a client? Is this a person I want to take on board? For me, my litmus test on interviews always is, would I work for them?

48:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. That's always the way to go. It's like, just switch the roles and you have a good answer.

48:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Because if you wouldn't work for somebody, don't hire them.

48:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need to jump off. I've got a call at 12.

48:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
But yeah, what's your process around thinking around this and then evolving this conversation?

49:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that would certainly be our. First, preference, just because I think it's an established pattern and it's cleaner in terms of what it is. Obviously, depending on how you value it, how much money you think you'd want for what percentage. I don't think, just to be clear, I don't think we have any interest in having a controlling stake at all, but I think it's really important that you and Jonas retain all control. So even if you are giving up shares, you want to make sure that you retain a different brand as well.

50:01 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you think? I wouldn't see a need for that.

50:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Obviously, as and when we collectively are building IP, then it goes into that company. Therefore, the equities is also part of the IP that we build and the clients that we build and the relationships we bring in. All of that matters. So having it as a single entity, for me, is the want to try to separate that?

50:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
What do you think?

50:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
That would be an immediate no for me in terms of that because you have two masters, you'd be pulling yourself in two different directions. I'd rather explore how, you know, there's a balance, right? I think you need to have two startups because it's innovation, it's pushing the market and potentially you can get, you know, one in ten becomes a Part of our role is to set the ambition of these larger corporates and to say, right, if you don't do X, you're going to get screwed. So it can be a very, you know, use case like actually I think going in and creating chatbots that can do customer service really well that's innovative like really so that one of the conversations I'm having is how do you create an AI boss that does customer service that also understands sentiment as when it might be starting to annoy the customer which you can then see Yeah and that's why I think it's really important that the standard you set is not about cranking out shit, it's about cranking out real business cases that actually shift the need of the market. Because like the clients, customers are incredibly price sensitive at the moment. So everything that they want is, if I'm going to spend a million with you, I need to be able to demonstrate a return on investment of two or three million. And so, I mean, generally the budgets that we tend to work on have been sort of, somewhere between 10 and 20 million a year to build products. So it's, you know, these are highly complex and innovative products for consultancies, really innovative. Like imagine, how do you process 1.5 billion rows of data and display insights in three seconds? Like, fuck that. How do you take a spend item that says, I spent 20,000 pounds and all you have is a company name? How do you classify that as spend? So we had to create website scrapers and then, well, all the websites just had COVID data. So that's not the company's essence. So there's some really, really interesting problems that are worth a huge amount to companies.

54:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's what I think.

54:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, we can, there's a lot of, so there's a, there's a, there's a couple ideas I have that I'm not going to share with you now that I think ideas or so when I was in alex partners we were um but well they did invest in the end uh in a company that promised something with ai and I was part of the team doing the due diligence and I was the only one calling bullshit on it and said it's emperor's clothing so do you know the emperor's clothing story no sir so it's a fable around this um emperor who was convinced by a charlatan that this, this, this clothes were so fine that you could barely see them or touch them. So he basically, there was no clothes. It was, it was a myth. And he basically, at the end, he's walking through the villages and everyone's like going, everyone had bought into the bullshit that he would, his clothes were so amazing, but he was basically this fat guy walking around the street naked and it took a child to go. But he's naked. And then suddenly everyone went, oh yeah, he is. So they had brought into that because he had power and influence, people were afraid to say what it is. And I basically called it out. I said, this is horseshit. They're not doing what they say they do. They've now taken it off their website. They don't talk about it anymore because it was a lie. But it was an amazing hook. And if they could do it, I think it would be amazing. And I think there is potential to do something in that space where if we could do it, it would be amazing if we could. I don't know if it's possible, but it could be done. And yeah, I think it would just be really good to talk in more detail. But again, I'd like to obviously have a formal relationship. I've actually just got the guy I met yesterday. He's just messaged me again to say he can do the introduction. I'd like to have this conversation a little bit more forward down so even if we're ironing out the details I can say to him that we're actually now sort of part of the company in some level of form and and that he can deal with me and because I can take I've got the next two months where I'm not super busy with my actual job before I leave so I can run But again, what does that mean? What's our rights? What can we do?

57:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So we can discuss that further down, right? But at least I am, I think Jonas is as well, in working with you guys, so. Okay, cool.

57:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, listen, I need to jump. I'm a bit late for this call, but I'd like to try and if we can get to some sort of broad agreement by the end of this week, if possible.

57:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
invested in JP's company, we would be able to potentially loop him in as part of a deal in terms of running marketing and starting to promote.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (39).txt"

Tue, Aug 27, 2024

0:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, man.

0:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. Cool.

0:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I have far too many windows open, and I've got no idea where anything is anymore. So give me a moment.

0:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
I've been going down rabbit holes on note-taking apps and voice-to-text apps. Because JP, for example, he doesn't type anything anymore, and he hasn't for years.

0:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So actually, that's a really good point.

0:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Give me a second. Where the heck is my thing?

0:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Pricing Obsidian.

0:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Nope, that's not it.

0:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Don't need that. Sorry, give me two seconds. I'm just trying to find where all my stuff has gone. Yeah, no problem. It's not that one.

1:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not that one. Yeah, it's not that one.

1:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Fuck's sake.

1:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I've just, it's...

1:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
I cannot find, I bloody, no, that's not it. Is that it?

1:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, so put that in a different window.

1:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
This works.

2:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just had it, and I don't know where it is. Sorry, I've got far too many windows, and I cannot find the...

2:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, no problem. I'm just going through some stuff in the meantime.

2:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye.

2:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hmm.

2:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think I have, I can search tabs. Oops.

3:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so OTT.

3:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, found it. All right. Okay, first of all, where are you? You are here. Sorry, I just want to track. I'm going to try and do a, I'm going to record a new meeting and I'm going to see how this does it.

3:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Otter, otter.ai, because one of the things it has is an AI agent that's listening to the chat, and you can start asking it to track decisions that are made throughout the meeting. So as I'm running a meeting, I can start referring back to saying, oh, right, by the way, we've made all these, just want to clarify, these are the decisions we've made. And so it can be a companion for me. So usually myself and Arif would need to co-run a meeting, I'm hypothesizing that that might allow us to run meetings in parallel.

4:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

4:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right. OK. So let me, I now have what I need. OK. So does it make sense what I'm explaining? That it now seems to be really polite at the end of a step, and then the start of the next step is a duplication of the previous message.

4:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, did you just get that issue right now? Because that's what I think I kind of solved.

4:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, let me, can you see my screen?

4:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's coming up.

4:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so let me let me clear this down.

4:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah, this example. Yeah, I think I commented on it in Discord. I think it's just a result of the step coming up being the playback step, which the instructions in the playback step is to repeat the conclusion you arrived at. And when the conclusion has arrived at in one confirmed sentence, it doesn't really have much else about that to say.

5:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

5:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
But for example, in the initial goal, it's actually summarizing. It's doing step three, and then step three happens. Let me show it to you. So if I say, what's your name? Cuan.

5:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Whatever.

5:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm done making mistakes. It doesn't really bother me anymore.

5:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need help losing weight. I've become too fat.

6:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm also using a lot of text-to-speech tools now. I'm using one called Super Whisper. That's quite powerful.

6:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Super Whisper?

6:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. It's very, very clever.

6:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

6:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is it based off the OpenAI Whisper?

6:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. OK.

6:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just concerned as I get older that it's going to cause all sorts of complications. So I think if I lose weight now, it'll be good for me.

6:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow. That's fast.

6:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. And you can give it prompts so that it can change the text format. So if you want to put it into an email, spit that out into the proper template. So by addressing this goal, you'll OK, it's fixed that. It's not summarized it. It's gone straight into playback, which is good.

6:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice.

6:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I did my job?

6:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
For now. And then I'll give you another glass ceiling in a few minutes.

7:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Thanks.

7:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm looking forward to it.

7:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this took myself and JP probably an hour to see if it was something wrong with the prompts. And then we decided to stop. The phase I think we're in now, as much as possible, I think we need to work with you, almost hand in glove. So we're going to do something. It'll start to break. And then we need your guidance to say, ah, that's a side effect of the way it's coded, rather than it being an error. Exactly what you've just done here, as opposed to it being a prompt. So I don't actually think this was a prompt issue. So we've now got step. Also, it's really good, because it's I don't want to say yes yet, because there's no step four and it'll crash. So what I'm going to do now is, so we've played it back. So we've confirmed what the initial goal is, right?

8:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now I want to do the visualizing step one.

8:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Also had quite a few alternate strategies for the how you provide prompts. Because he said, it's almost the more prescriptive you are, the more it will go wrong. It's a balance. Okay, let's see if I can get to this stage.

8:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is where I was getting confused earlier on as well. If I can, once I get to this, I need to do one more step just to the future score.

9:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
A tiny feature request, if at all possible.

9:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Could we change the icon, just different colors, one red and one beige, just between the chat interface and the admin interface? It just makes it super easy finding it in the top which one I need to click on, because they're identical, so I get confused. Because everything is optimized around testing.

9:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, that logo was a logo I just generated with cloud or no, but what was, yeah, I generated it using Gemini for that. I just make a local with me. Yeah, it's perfect.

10:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
It doesn't, it doesn't really matter. So hi.

10:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can do it. Hi, my name is this, and then it'll like catch that you did it in one sentence.

10:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
I really need help losing some weight.

10:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's interesting. I didn't copy and paste that. I need help losing some weight. Yeah, I think sometimes the focus gets lost out of this box quite easily.

10:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's if you click outside it.

10:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
This feels a little bit quicker than it was I'm not sure.

11:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
It may just be that because it's open, well, it's on Azure's open AI servers in Sweden. So it may just be sometimes there are less people using it. Sometimes there are more people using it, especially because it's like almost midnight now in Sweden. Or wait, no, that doesn't look bad. It's been out here, not in Sweden.

11:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, the challenge we have is that sometimes it's taking 15 to 20 seconds for it to respond. And that's a challenge.

11:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm concerned as I get older that carrying weight is going to give me all sorts of complications. I really don't want to ever lose mobility.

11:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, the sooner we can get voice into this, the better.

12:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so you see here, why is it given two messages there?

12:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
And see this time, it has, at the end of step two, it is now clarifying what's in step three. It didn't do that the previous step we just did.

12:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for me, where it says Step 2, I think that's Step 3.

12:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

12:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
But if I go yes, I think we'll go into Step 3 now, and it'll do a better job.

12:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
What if you said no there? That would really confirm it if it was Step 3, because then it wouldn't try to go into Step 3 it was not correct. Yeah.

12:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Now it's in Step 3.

12:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. Yeah. So it was in step two, I think previously.

13:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. But again, it didn't do that the last time I showed it to you. So let me just try that one more time.

13:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
And it's done the message either way, apparently. Next.

13:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, there's a couple of rough edges.

14:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
I wonder if that would be a rough edge in the real use case, though, because after your first message, if you say, hi, my name is something, you'd expect to get a greeting back and not just, what is it that you see that's helping you even though the condition was fulfilled.

14:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it seems to be a weird handshake there. OK.

14:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
I wonder if it would be a natural handshake, though, if you went from a natural perspective, hi, my name is Hello, Cuan. My name is Maria. It's great to meet you. It's great to meet you too, Maria. And then what is it that you see that's helping you?

14:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So now we've just done it. This is the third time we've done it. And now it's deciding to suddenly ask me more questions. And that's exactly the same answer I gave it.

14:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
I guess just the inconsistency of large language models have to refine the prompts. That's what I'm guessing.

15:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's trying to get clearer about the goal.

15:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ever lose mobility.

15:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

15:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think if we don't get these edges out of the system, I don't think it's ever going to be useful. I think people are going to get annoyed with it.

15:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I'm just wondering if the edges here are in the prompt or in the infrastructure. And I think it's in the prompt currently.

15:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So now it hasn't summarized and now it's gone to step three.

15:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
So step three.

15:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So the goal has been shared back to the user, and we're stuck.

16:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not sure why it's not going to step four.

16:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's like it's completely leading its own goal and the first message it's sending in step three, which is a bit of like an edge case.

16:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Ok, let's move to four. So that's an edge case. Can you track that as an issue that it can artificially stop?

16:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, I mean, I think in step three, you can, in the prompt, tell it to advance that immediately.

17:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay. So where would this be?

17:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
In outcome, instead of saying user got shared back or user goal got shared back to the user, just say advanced step now or something like immediate advanced step in the same message immediately or always.

17:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, let me go back and start again.

17:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
My AI is not recording my humming.

17:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
How much does the super whisper cost?

17:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a free version for 25 minutes. Then there's eight euros, eight dollars a month or eight euros a month. Something like the 70 year or 250 lifetime.

17:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, um, yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's good.

18:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

18:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just how many years would buying yearly compared to lifetime? I imagine that amount of years there would be a better system out there.

18:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
True.

18:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that looks like it's done step three. As I'm reading that, that is a step three action. But it's asking for compensation.

18:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's still part of step two. It's just the natural way of the language model is confirming with you after talking about something.

18:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so I said, do not summarize the step back to the user.

19:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe say, like, do not summarize or ask for confirmation of the step back to the user. Just advance that if the user has shared their goal.

19:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Should I put that in the outcome?

19:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
I am not sure how much it matters.

19:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So under the hood, is the whole purpose and outcome actually an artificial split?

19:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, if you scroll down, it's kind of just two variables that you can put where you want it in the facilitators prompt.

19:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
One of the things I was speaking to JP earlier on, which might make things very complex, he is saying that we're probably going to need step branching.

20:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Depending on an answer, you might want to go off to another branch.

20:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

20:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is what happened earlier on. See? It just gets stuck.

20:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nice to meet you, Kevin. Nice to meet you, too, I guess. I'm guessing this will come down to refining the outcome prompt to make sure it advanced that at the proper time.

20:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Advanced that immediately or something afterwards.

21:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
It seems weird just to, you had that in the facilitator prompt already. And it feels like we're reinforcing it in there. Seems a bit weird.

21:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hmm. Fine.

22:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
But it didn't advance that in the same message.

22:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

22:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Any ideas how we?

22:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
I can give another shot at rephrasing the step. I can give a shot at rephrasing the step for the outcome. Can I try? Sure.

23:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, yeah, formats work later. You may have to reload. It doesn't seem to have synced back to you.

23:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe a message like that can work.

23:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Here we go again. Hi.

24:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Check one thing will be useful.

24:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

24:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we can keep the log back to a certain number of the steps we can...

24:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Actually, I can provide a delete button next to messages and deleting messages will just effectively just erase them from the memory.

24:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you can go back within the chat, the live chat.

24:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, like at least for now, because it's, I think it'll, I can implement that in like 10, 15 minutes, just hit the delete button next to each message so that you can just hit delete, delete, delete instead of having to Uh, yeah. I can't hack at it.

24:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's not really what I wanted to tell it. Okay. So that's really interesting. Yeah. So that's a, that's a SQL injection type thing, isn't it? Uh, yeah.

25:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's just like, you can mess with any AS kind of ever, it's just, As long as, I mean, they can ruin, people can ruin their own experience, but that's kind of a given. You can't do anything to prevent people from ruining their own experience, I guess, except for having like a guardian bot that's trained at catching those messages.

26:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

26:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Any ideas why that is?

26:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, on the right, you can see an error occurred with your deployment.

26:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
There's an error within an error.

26:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've never seen that one before. It's to 504, which is the gate we've tied now.

26:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
The gateway does time out every so often. I think it may not deal with that very gracefully. Now, see where? So it's skipped. Because of that, it's got confused, and it's skipped step three.

26:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I see. I'm wondering how that's happened technically. Did it post a message which didn't show up in the front end, maybe?

26:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe.

27:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll see if I can get the delete message button in for you.

27:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
That would be a big win on time.

27:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

27:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll just hack at that.

27:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is there a way that, for example, if I click one above here, it deletes everything underneath it?

27:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's a bit more advanced, because I don't have it. But I'll just get the Delete Message button in for now, and then we can look into improving it after.

27:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's stuck again.

27:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that message didn't work.

27:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think there is a fundamental assumption here that the user gives an action.

27:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
The user has to give a response. Because you see here, it's agent, person, agent, person, agent, person. Here, we're saying it's an agent, agent.

28:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we're asking it to go to step four. And I think there's something either in the facilitator script here where we've basically gone, where is?

28:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
For debugging purposes, I've removed the advanced step word from the messages, which I think just at the moment is making it harder to debug. So if you think it's fine, I can just not remove it from the message, which of course doesn't work.

28:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
We put all these brand bots and strategy, but where did all these come from

28:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me check something.

28:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
I didn't create those.

28:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
They're in the front end of every workshop. There's some error there.

29:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm going to delete them. Be a bit careful because, yeah, don't delete them. I think they're only in the front end, but it's JP's bots. They're just in his workshop right now. OK.

29:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I deleted one of them anyway.

29:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Work on this purpose until there is no need to summarize the existing step. Well, sometimes there is.

29:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well done. I'm just saving JP's brand bots.

29:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

29:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, don't delete the agents. That just deletes it from JP's workshop.

29:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
But they don't have it there. Could this issue here be to ask a maximum of one question at a time, never more than one? Ensure the user has attempted to answer your question before asking new ones. Do you think this statement here might be causing it to stall, that it thinks it's asked a question and it's waiting for the user to do something?

30:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
It could be.

30:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

30:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you have not asked an explicit question, move on.

30:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that delete button could be gold dust.

31:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I just noticed that even if you delete, it won't go back in step, which makes it a little bit more complicated.

31:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, because if it thinks it's at step five and you delete all the way back to step three, it'll think it's at five.

31:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Even if you reload the page?

31:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's got a step stored in the the database. So I thought, what if it goes back to the step on the message before the message you delete? But that also doesn't work, because if you just delete the message in the middle of chat, it'll not work properly. But if you just don't delete the message in the middle of chat, it should be fine.

31:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Should be.

31:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
So I'll just do that for now.

31:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it's getting stuck here all the time.

32:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it feels pretty good. I'm really happy about things and I'm proud of all the weight I've lost.

33:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm not sure, maybe some butterflies in my tummy or I'm wearing a smile, but I'm not entirely sure.

33:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
When it gets in long, by the way, you can see it forces the text bit off the page.

33:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I haven't focused much on the UI yet. I think Will has been working on some on it. So instead of the whole page kind of being in a box, it's just the chat that's in a box and the input field remains at the bottom.

33:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think I'll probably take on a 10 kilometer run. It's not something I've been able to do for a couple of years.

33:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the voice of this is so important because how I talk is not how I type.

34:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

34:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Probably immense joy and pride. Hopefully my family are there to experience it with me.

34:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, why does it say bye? I think I heard you say something.

34:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Keeps on doing these physical things. I think that's possibly...

34:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, I don't think I'd have any physical sensations apart from just being really tired.

35:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's definitely a prompt.

35:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why is it doing this? Let's lock in this vision. Your initial goal is to lose weight to avoid future health complications of intimidation. Isn't important to you because you want to ensure a healthy and active future. Imagine the immense joy and pride you feel, especially with your family by your side, when you achieve this goal and take on a new challenge or challenge.

35:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Why is it doing this? I don't fucking know. Step four, why is it doing this?

35:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I've done it because I've asked it to do that. Okay, fine.

35:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's doing what I've asked it to do, that's why. Yeah, I feel pretty cool.

36:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
I wonder how...

36:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I wonder if we can, because there is dictate on the phone, the Apple one, and it's pretty good. So I wonder whether we could tell the bot to teach people how to turn that on.

36:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
It'S now stuck again.

36:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

36:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's definitely still whatever you've done with the advanced step has improved one issue, but it's now not naturally advancing.

37:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

37:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, so it's not advancing in the same message. Something gets completed.

37:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and also, but this is better now because it was getting It was asking me this 1 to 10 about my future state, not this. So this is really good.

37:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
What I don't want to say is visualize. So remember that version of you 12 months from now.

37:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, let's say give it a nine.

38:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Rather than let's, so for example, you see where it says, let's make that nine out of 10 a reality. What I'd like to be able to do is say there's nothing wrong with that message, but rather than let's make that a nine out of like 10 with adapt, we're going to make that nine out of 10 a reality. Yeah. So I don't understand how to do that in a where I have a chat and I can highlight the text and I'd say, this is a better way to say it. How do I do that in the workshop?

38:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, we haven't implemented the review system into the workshop builder yet.

38:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

38:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
So when that's in, you'll be able to do that.

38:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

38:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, I think tomorrow, probably with George, at some point, probably 9am or 8am again, we should probably go in a deeper discussion about just how we should move forward with the Workshop Builder, what you're guys' plans are, if you want to invest more into the workshop builder and expanding that, or where do you want to move? Yeah, yeah. Basically, yeah.

39:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, the answer is yes. We need to at least probably get another two weeks of your time to start building into it. So just assume two weeks approved.

39:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
OK. Yeah.

39:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll inform George of that. Yeah, we'll talk with him tomorrow. But I also think, yeah, we should probably have a poll just to get things on paper and everything.

39:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
The problem is that I think we're at a phase now where it's going to be a little bit like this, where we're going, I need to do something, and I'm blocked. So I think there's probably a bit of a roadmap that we know we want. But I think there's going to be really important emerging things, which is like going, stop the roadmap. Give me the delete button, give me the review button, because that allows me to test this. So for me, what I'm trying to do, and I've almost got to a happy path now. Now I want to go, there's still an issue with the step, need to fix that issue.

40:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
One question I'd have is, is there any value in putting more people on this? Because this is the secret sauce. Having LMSs and all the other shit, honestly, if we can't get this really, really good, there is no product. So I'm almost not interested in the LMS and everything else yet until we can get this humming. So obviously, I know that too many cooks spoil the broth as well. You have too many people as well. It doesn't always make things go faster. But just you, I'm wondering if we can put more people onto this and divert them, if it makes sense.

40:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

41:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it would probably be mostly like AI developers on this then.

41:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Yeah. There's no UX issue. Cause again, if we can get the review elements from adapt into this, rather than rebuilding it, that would be really positive. Um, The thing that JP feels like this is good, but it's not insanely different from what you could do with other things. It certainly doesn't look like it. We know under that is the real thing for him is having the multi-agents. So for me, just the path. So, you know, where my head is, we go happy path with facilitator. Yeah. I then start going more robust and trying to break the facilitator.

41:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then there is incorporating multi-agents. And also in parallel is the review system, so we can start tweaking individual messages and get that better. But there's definitely, I mean, it's definitely good. I think we do need to improve the transition from a step to another step.

42:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

42:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
But yeah, for me, I think these sessions are becoming insanely powerful to make progress and understand what the next, because you can, I think when you're seeing this, you can see our frustration, like, oh, we want to do this. So those things I think need to be fixed first. But I think, for example, if we could give incorporating the review stuff, it's a known feature. It's already built. Give that to another engineer to bring over rather than wasting your time. I'd rather do some of the more sort of reactive things here, because I think you're a more senior engineer. And you know this inside out. You're getting to know what we need better as well.

43:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah. Well, definitely was discussing with the others, yeah.

43:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool.

43:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right. It's better. It's better.

43:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm trying to figure out. Let me see now. I may have just completed the delete button. Oh, wow. They're huge.

43:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me see if it works.

43:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
But won't the delete button cause problems if it doesn't reset the step?

43:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
It does reset. It's not working correctly, but it just resets the step to what the step of the previous message was, which means if you're deleting from the bottom up, it'll work perfectly. But if you're deleting a message in the middle, it'll reset to completely the wrong step, because it's like, what step would you use?

43:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's fine. If you delete bottom up, that's fine.

43:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

44:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
But it didn't work too perfectly.

44:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, it's deleting you.

44:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
people.

44:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
It is working. I just forgot that messages when their new paragraph are split into two messages, but if you hit one of the two delete buttons, it deletes both, which is expected behavior.

44:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So do you want to start that now? Is that pushed?

45:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll push it now. It looks kind of ugly, but I hope that's fine.

45:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Aesthetics are totally fine.

45:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, it's push should be deployed in like 30 seconds or a minute or something, however long the result takes.

45:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right, so how do we, how do you debug this, this stepping issue? Like what can we do to test that?

45:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, my hope is that by the time you're awake tomorrow, it's fixed. Or at least I've figured out a reliable way to solve it.

45:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So the Y2 workshop is pretty good in terms of how deep it goes. It doesn't complete it, but it's pretty deep.

45:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I'm just looking at the Figma jam, where is this?

46:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So visualize the future. So the next step will be to start doing the smart aspects and then wrap up. So I might actually start adding those bits in now.

46:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Where is this?

46:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

46:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
The very ugly delete button is deployed.

47:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just going to see if we can.

47:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Go the whole way down.

47:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think also JP. Sorry. Is much better at sort of, cause he's not being an engineer. He's not an engineer. So he doesn't code. Um, I, have, and I'm talking to this programmatically, where he's speaking more prose, like he would speak to a person.

47:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think his way might be more successful.

47:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's quite interesting.

47:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
like a form of programming where it's almost flipped on the head because it benefits from natural speech. Yeah. Why don't we reload the page now, see if the delete buttons are there.

48:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Cool.

48:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
I just copied the one from the bottom left.

48:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can't read properties of undefined.

48:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
What?

48:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's a...

48:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, well. Your steps have numbers in them, right?

48:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Pretty sure.

48:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
I cannot read properties of undefined.

48:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, we had C-H-A.

48:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
C-H-A-R. Yeah, OK.

48:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I know why that's happening. Let's do a little bit of a fancy null check.

49:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does it make sense what's happening to you? Yeah. I'm just going to get some fruit. Yep. You So, Okay.

52:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right, I'm back.

52:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
The error was that I was getting the previous message to see the step there and the first message doesn't have a previous message.

52:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
But the fix is pushed now, should be there in like 20 seconds or something.

53:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
You can give it a try now. Did you reload? Yeah.

53:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Maybe too soon.

53:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think I'm able. Hold on.

53:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm going to fix it a bit more.

54:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, published a proper fix now should be live in like 30 seconds. Okay.

55:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's deployed. And probably control on hard reload.

56:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I wonder if you reload the page now, if the first message you sent will show up again.

56:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Trying that. Yeah. I don't know.

57:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think one of the aspects that JP wants is a lot of these answers at the moment are stock OpenAI answers. Yeah. And it's how do we make it ours?

57:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

57:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the reviews system will probably be one of the main big contributors there. Because when the review system is in place, it'll just be like pumping the chat, like the AI, with so many examples of how it should respond that the nature of its responses should mimic those examples.

58:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So it's still getting stuck.

58:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
But now does the delete button work? I mean, that's not a sharpie. Does the delete button work at least?

58:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So sometimes it says this is one message and sometimes it splits them out into three.

58:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's just the separate. When there's a new paragraph, it's getting split into a new message instead of actually having one big message with new paragraphs.

58:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
You should be able to. On the last iteration, it just sent the middle one. It didn't set the first one. And in this message, it included this part.

58:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, yeah. OK.

58:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's inconsistent on the granularity.

59:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
With the granularity, I think that'll be fixed with just reviews.

59:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because you should, by the time you're launching or by the time a workshop is in proper use, I imagine you've posted many reviews for every single step to the point where these sections should be consistent.

1:00:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
you of So I think it's rather than keep these feelings, it's like he's giving me the job. It's like, it's really important that the coach realizes that they're going to be with you on on the way. So I said, these feelings are really important. So the message is right. We're going to use these as a powerful motivation as we go through the ADAPT program. If you hit a blocker, this is what we're going to do. So that what I'm assuming will be a review rather than a prompt.

1:01:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, and on top of that, it'll probably be part of the defining the outputs of a workshop, like the desired outputs of a workshop that saved variables, if that makes sense. Yeah. This will probably have some way of, or I imagine the bot will respond in a different way when it knows it is saving it to its live memory. But yeah, in the review, that's something you can find to Unipower, definitely.

1:01:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's good. So it's incorporated some of the 10k. That's clever. It's incorporated some of the visualization statement there. That's good.

1:02:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nice. Yeah.

1:02:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. Great job. Great job. That's one of the things that the AI response to it's too, it's too pleasant.

1:02:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. It's stuck. It's getting, it seems to be almost stuck at every, at the end of every step.

1:02:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:02:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
We said, only ever ask one question. It's asked two there.

1:03:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Didn't you? Or did you remove that section? I mean, yeah. I think that's just LLM's not being perfect, to be honest.

1:03:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
One question at a time.

1:03:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Never mind one shorter.

1:03:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm only going to give it one answer and see what it says.

1:03:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
It may count as one question with two outputs.

1:03:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

1:03:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
It may count as one question with two outputs because it's technically one sentence.

1:03:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I know. That's why I think it's weird. One question mark. I think it's been true.

1:03:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:03:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's fine, but I don't want it to say this. It's assuming, anyway, so eight weeks.

1:04:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I hope those problems you have with specific responses, to me, they sound like more so things that are bound to be fixed through reviews, more so than things that are fundamentally wrong, if that makes sense.

1:04:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So it's saying to adjust your time frame, but it should be the time frame or the weight.

1:04:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:04:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, for me, with those kinds of problems, I'm pretty confident because that also is another thing where I can imagine you just clicking on it, clicking bad response, and then correcting it to an improved response.

1:05:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Once we get this done, I'm assuming there's no logic changes to converting these texts into a conversation.

1:05:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Voice conversation?

1:06:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so voice in, voice out.

1:06:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

1:06:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
As far as I know, no.

1:06:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Converting voice to text and text to voice again. Of course, the concern I remember you had with that is that AI won't be able to tell the sentiment from the user's voice. So that's kind of the main differentiator with the mood or the tone, intonations, the pauses, and the voice can't come through pure text. But I imagine there's some way of encoding that.

1:06:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Whisper does support sentiment analysis from OpenAI. My concern is that text does not convey sentiment, not the voice. Because I know with the OpenAI demo, it was able to see concern and happiness in a face. So if you're stuttering or pausing, I think it does have some sentiment intonation or analysis in it by default. When you convert it to text, all that gets taken out. That's the issue.

1:07:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So rather than my voice going to OpenAI converted to text and text going into the system, my voice would have to go over to OpenAI. OpenAI would then have to give that text plus sentiment.

1:07:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that will be then taken to the system to do something with. But we're at the end now. I haven't done this step nine. But we've got down to step nine. Pretty robustly. I think that the challenge now is the, I'm going to try and, I need to go into the garden for a second because a tree has fallen down or a branch has.

1:07:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I need to look at this. I think this is good. It's definitely more happy path. I'm going to see where I can start breaking it again in the morning when I wake up. But I think we're certainly at a place now where we can go through it. I think getting the reviews over will be really good.

1:08:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think, I'm trying to think, what else? The transition from one step to the next. I think the transition seems to be a bit buggy.

1:08:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Yeah, I think we're aligned there.

1:08:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. Right. Well, I'll see you bright and early.

1:08:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Before you leave, could you just test that the delete buttons work?

1:09:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me go up a bit more. I'm not too sure.

1:09:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, that's weird.

1:09:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's on stage eight.

1:09:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to get rid of step eight. I'm going to get rid of this last step. And then I can go, I can. And maybe that's correct. Yeah, now it's gone into step nine. I think that's fine.

1:09:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah?

1:09:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:09:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I wonder now, just for fun, what will happen if you just deleted some message in step six and then send another message. I think it'll reset the step to step five or six, and then I'll confuse to all the bots.

1:10:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
No. There may be a bug in the step resetting then. If you delete up until I usually lose weight quite fast and just repeat that message, I wonder if it will be at step 9 or step 8 when you send that message.

1:11:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
I also want to get rid of that full page reload every time a message is deleted.

1:11:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
That deleted two messages.

1:11:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
It wasn't actually two messages. It was one message with a paragraph between. That's what confused me too when I said like, Oh, wait, it isn't working. And then I realized, oh, yeah, it was one message, but two paragraphs.

1:11:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

1:11:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's all set now.

1:11:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:11:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
So it's not going back in step correctly.

1:11:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
But it's acting, it's acting as step eight. It's still, it's still acting this questions.

1:11:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hmm.

1:12:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Uh, will you be continuing to like test it throughout today?

1:12:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I'm done now.

1:12:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm gonna yeah, then I think I'll just leave it for tomorrow morning and get at Fixing that plus the other bugs tomorrow morning.

1:12:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Perfect. Cheers, buddy.

0:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, that's too much British for me. I haven't had it in a long time. How's everyone doing? Great, yeah. I'm struggling with a cold. Can you me?

0:25 - Arif Harbott 
Yes, yes.

0:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I wasn't lighting up.

0:30 - Arif Harbott 
Code's on mute, so I think he's talking to himself.

0:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, did you say Jonas is sunburned and you've got a cold?

0:38 - Eksno 
Yeah.

0:39 - Eksno 
Yeah, I'm sure you're gonna see how red my face is.

0:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I'm tired, by the way. I've been there too many times.

0:58 - Eksno 
sudden poisoning to yesterday's about bad fever towards the evening, but much better now.

1:07 - Eksno 
Cool. Cool. Oh, lagging.

1:12 - Eksno 
I'm cutting out a lot.

1:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Jorge, I'm lagging.

1:18 - Jorge Lewis 
A lot.

1:29 - Eksno 
You can hear me?

1:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:37 - Eksno 
I can hear you like once every five seconds, but apparently you can hear me. So.

1:44 - Eksno 
Okay.

1:47 - Eksno 
Uh, yeah. Well then just start stream.

1:56 - Eksno 
Uh, yeah. Can you guys see?

2:00 - Eksno 
Yeah, nice. So this is the UI of the application.

2:10 - Eksno 
landing page is just, hey, Cuan, this is a placeholder. Go to chat, and then there's the chat. That's about it for the UI on the web application. Then there's the API, which we've been working on a lot of the foundation of the application. So basically getting the database up with correct tables and all of that. But we've also got a working chat bot currently, which has a pretty like ad hoc prompt of the responsibilities you've outlined. Yeah, just to get it to be pretending to be an opinionated coach to be a proof of concept until you guys can refine the prompt.

2:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. The prompts are not dictating the response. They're dictating the parameters by which they can respond within.

3:08 - Eksno 
Sorry, could you rephrase?

3:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
So are the prompts telling the bot, a simplistic version is, if a customer asks what time it is, you must respond this way. Or are they saying, irrespective of the question that gets asked, you need to look at this data, you need to have this tone. So it's setting boundaries as opposed to being explicit.

3:36 - Eksno 
Currently, the prompt just describes what kind of person it is. So, like, as a holistic performance catalyst, you are the embodiment of tough love. Yeah, just waffle, basically, about how it should behave. It's not dictating the answer, it's dictating the behavior. Yeah. Leon is currently working on implementing RAG, which will be used to dictate the behavior. Basically, you just dump on it a huge document. And when the user asks a question, it looks at that huge document, picks out the most relevant parts of the document, and that will dictate how it should answer. So set the boundaries and set exact examples.

4:21 - Eksno 
OK.

4:23 - Eksno 
Yeah, so here I just started a test chat because sometimes it goes on a waffle. But yeah, it's just asking me, like, going through the just steps I outlined here. What's your current fitness routine? I can say, like, I go to the gym two times per week.

4:44 - Eksno 
Send that.

4:46 - Eksno 
Then it takes a bit to respond. We're currently just using OpenAI's servers.

4:55 - Eksno 
Then it completely disses me. That was more of a proof of concept to just make sure it can be opinionated and doesn't just conform to whatever the user says.

5:08 - Eksno 
As you can see here, it also can send multiple messages in a row, which I think you requested.

5:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's the opposite actually. So if a user gives an update across multiple messages that it's able to Understand that the person is still talking rather than responding to the first message Okay Yeah So, yeah.

5:44 - Eksno 
I'm wondering what the best way to implement that will be, though, because inherently that'll incorporate some delay in the answers of the bot. So if you type and then it has a wait to check if you're typing again, then it'll have to wait longer, but if long response times don't matter, that's fine.

6:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think there's a... In my head, there's two aspects to knowing that a message is complete. One is time, and one is...

6:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
a bit more variable and subjective as to the context. Does the sentence, like if I said to you, you know something, I did loads of things this morning, so I was at the beach, The person, you know, based on what I said that you're expecting, you wouldn't say, you would hold back and you'd be waiting for me to say, Oh, and then I did that. Then I watched the car this and I did this like, Oh, okay. So just time is, is, is one aspect, but it's also a bit crude. I think we want to refine it to have this traded over time to have this ability to notice when a, when a point has been made.

6:51 - Eksno 
Yeah. Do you think we could use like sentiment analysis for that, Jorge?

6:57 - Jorge Lewis 
So I was thinking initially, we can, because we had the first, the simplest solution is to add a delay. I want to see if the delay is good enough, the quality feels like it's fast enough, and there isn't much of an issue.

7:11 - Eksno 
The delay plus the like make a custom sentiment analysis, but probably in the future sometime.

8:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, I mean, it's great to see it. I suppose there's two questions in my head. When do you think there'll be a version that we get to play with? And secondly, when will there be an interface where we can start training it? Because both of those things then allow JP's thing to start as well.

9:08 - Eksno 
Do you want me to take that one or do you want Jorge?

9:11 - Jorge Lewis 
You can go ahead. I can add on if I need to.

9:15 - Eksno 
So this version currently we can get up and hosted throughout the next week and hopefully by the end of next week we'll have an admin interface where you can at least edit this prompt and hopefully some form of the rank so you can start building up the document of example questions and answers.

9:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Excellent. Yeah.

9:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
and PDFs and stuff like that. Give it a sort of both from a coaching point of view, these are things that we think are good references versus knowledge of, okay, here's evidence to support this diet recommendation or this movement recommendation.

10:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

10:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

10:26 - Jorge Lewis 
conversation.

10:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because if I'm a consultant, right, and I read a book, I'm fully expected that I can deploy that knowledge. Obviously, I would never pass that knowledge off as my own. I've used Daniel Pink's book, Drive, in hundreds of workshops that I've been in, and I will talk about it. How is that particularly different? And I know it is different, but it's a very gray line between me having a commercial boss that is We're not trying to plagiarise. We're not trying to say that any of their work is our work. But we're trying to educate a bot. Now, I could, if I wanted to, write all that stuff out. From my own experience, it's just saving me having to regurgitate it. And actually, I would say, if I ask ChatGPT to summarize any of those books, it will, without giving it the PDF or the EPUB file. Because there's enough content online about it. So, I mean, JP, you've got thoughts on this. It's a really big issue in terms of content.

11:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's a massive issue at the moment and there's no solution. There's no right answer at the moment. I mean, what I would suggest is if you want to remain in the boundaries of ethics, then you might say can you reproduce something with the philosophies of or the or the ethos of rather than give maybe sets of pdfs of proprietary information so you're kind of skirting around it a little bit but I mean other people out there will be doing exactly the opposite they'll be putting as much data in as they can to make themselves look good to make their product the best so it's a question of do you want to get it right or do you want to remain within the bounds of ethics?

12:46 - Jorge Lewis 
to let me.

13:04 - Arif Harbott 
answer then I don't think you need to. I mean all of humans right we've all learned from someone or something or books or some other people we're not going to cite everything we've ever known. If you're actually giving a quote I think it's really important to do that.

13:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're saying this is kind of based on these three Yeah, for example, if you look at Zone 2 Cardio, I think it's almost impossible to know who created that. And there's hundreds of people, of experts, who are saying it's good. So we could just choose one and say, hey, if you want to know more, go speak to this guy. We've chosen, for example, Sleep, a guy called Dr. Matthew Walker, who's written a really great book called Why Do We Sleep? So we are choosing that we will pick on his stuff as exemplars of what we think good is. We're not going to try and hide from that. In fact, we're going to be saying, hey, if you want to go deeper on this, here's some really great podcasts of Matthew Walker's. We're going to be referring and driving people to his company. So a bit like if we're writing a blog post.

14:13 - Jonathan Phillips 
That's completely fine. That doesn't even impinge on ethics. It's when you're suggesting you have a model that someone else has invented and have IP rights and you're passing it off as your own work. I think that's the only time it becomes a little bit sketchy at the moment.

14:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I don't think we're intending to do that at all. Like, for example, we've created, there's loads of books around like atomic habits and all these different habit books. So we're putting that into the coach, but so that it can understand and we'll train it as to which aspects of habits, because, for example, I might like a more forceful, regimental approach, and other people might like more of a cheerleader-y approach. There isn't just one answer to this. And so we've got to give the bot access to flavors of how to fix the problem rather than a way to fix the problem.

15:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
But we're not passing off anyone's methodology or framework on how to do stuff. That's not what we're doing.

15:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
When do you sort of just try and set expectations of myself? Like, when do you think that there will be a demo app deployed so I could play with it on my phone?

15:32 - Eksno 
By next week.

15:36 - Eksno 
Like, we'll get the current version hosted throughout the next week. And then hopefully by the end of next week, as I mentioned, you'll also have an admin panel where you can edit the prompts and everything. Currently, we have made it so that the prompts are bound to the profile ID, which means that each of you will have your own one to play with, so that you don't have to be afraid to destroy any of JP's work or anything like that. So hopefully, you can just copy and paste back and forth. But if you'd rather have it so that it's shared between everyone, we can also do that.

16:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, I think, well, it's interesting. I think there's one bot serving many people.

16:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
one personality, one set of approaches, one set of behaviors. Now we might have a common behavior and a common knowledge set, but there might be different personalities. Arnold Schwarzenegger or the cheerleader, you know, you've got a different range of personality types. Sorry.

16:39 - Eksno 
In the end, it will all be unified. I meant during the experiment and development stage. Do you want to be editing for the same admin panel, so editing the same prompt which everyone shares? Or do you want to have your own so that you don't have to be afraid?

16:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, for the time being, it will be a single admin panel that's controlling one bot that talks to everybody. It might be different.

17:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
be myself and my wife who will be going in and looking at chat logs and refining the messaging.

17:26 - Eksno 
Do you want to be editing the same prompt then or do you want to have separate so that you don't have to be afraid of messing up the other person's prompts? Of course you can just share between even like text messages if you have found a good prompt you want to share with your wife.

17:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you tried it?

17:53 - Eksno 
Yeah, that's what I mean. So you can like experiment locally without it updating the bot everywhere.

18:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, fine.

18:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think, yes, you probably want a centralized bot. That is confirmed. But then we might want to iterate independently and say, oh, this was good. OK, put that into the actual live bot, for want of a better word.

18:26 - Eksno 
OK.

18:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So basically being able to publish your changes?

18:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
To a live bot, yeah. And then that would be the one that people would iterate on. Because again, we're not going to know what a good prompt is. It's going to take a while for us to learn the mechanics of what makes a prompt useful.

18:41 - Eksno 
Yeah. Yeah, sounds good. I think I know what you want. Okay.

19:30 - Eksno 
Yeah.

19:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
And again, if you look at those books, and that's what I meant in one of my earlier questions, like what is quality data? There is 60% of the content in those books are pointless because it's just fast. It's just fast words. It's just, it's just blah, blah, blah. It's page fillers. It's not actually substance. The substance is what's really useful. So we could then go, right, let's generate synopses. I think JP had a really good word out there, like build me a referential version of this book. Give me the 20% of the book that gives me 80% of the value to enable me to do this. Like what are the actual functional bits of the book as opposed to all the, But maybe the back stories are really useful, I don't know. I think we need to figure that out over time. So this was just sort of a first pass, let's get going. And then we'll learn over time what makes it good in terms of the right data.

20:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Am I right in saying that all these books and all this data that we have, what happens is that gets parsed down into a vector database and then the vector database is what feeds the bot?

20:45 - Eksno 
That would be more of a knowledge base. How it works with RAG is more... I'm not sure exactly how Leon is the one currently working on it, but it picks out sections from the book that are most relevant to the question, and then passes those directly as context to the bot through the system prompt.

21:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. And just to regurgitate that question that I've asked you too many times about the difference between the LLM and the LAM, which I now understand. So in JP's context, we would probably be, for the bot that might be going out and looking at the web for stuff, that would use a LAN in order to know what to do, as opposed to an LLM. Is that correct?

21:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
So imagine you're doing this mission statement workshop. It's evolving and the sentence is becoming, yeah, we want to increase the adoption of sustainable energy because it's an eco startup. And they're like, oh, that sounds great. That'd be really exciting. If I was in that workshop, I'd be going, that's really similar to Tesla. You can't really do that. That's not useful. So we'd want a bot in real time to be looking at competitors or the market for similarities going, you've just come up with Tesla's, that's not useful. Or you've come up with the Southwest Airlines or whatever it is. So that would just be one job for a bot that would be going out to the web to validate things. When we came up with that thing, marketing, we would then do like, has anyone taken the .com domain? Is that a part website or is it a live website? Simple checks like that where you just go domain's gone, but it's not a live service where marketing dot AI Domain was gone and it's a live service and it's really similar to what you're doing. Okay, that's interesting. I So I was reading an article during the week that with the advent of chat GPT 4.0, that the fact that it can now see is beforehand, you've got to take a video, transcribe it to text, that text goes into a vector database to train the model.

24:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like it's just gone exponential on its potential. Is that something that's limited to chat GPT 4.0? Is that something that we could take advantage of and it's not text and we could start running workshops? Like if JP ran a workshop, could it in essence observe, learn and do it that way? Because it would be far more nuanced than writing a script like you asked him to do for his version.

24:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
necessarily easier, but it's more nuanced because you don't have to translate it to text. It's able to take it directly from the visual input.

25:20 - Jorge Lewis 
to think.

25:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Interesting.

25:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think so. Should we do anything else?

26:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because he sort of speaks a lot of the truth, but yeah, he's he's still he's still a certified psychologist He's he's quite controversial in some of those rules But he's... Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it depends. I think it depends what stage you are at life. I think there's... So Arif and a guy we used to work with, Sam, used to work in the UK government for a lot. And we had this pattern here. So when you're really young and you're a student and you've no money, you support from the people that rich people are. As you get older and you amass money, you tend to go to the other party, the conservatives, which are about not giving things to people because you're the ones who have them at that point and they're taking from you. So I think all of these things have different levels of appropriateness depending where you are in your life and your personal circumstances as opposed to being a ubiquitous universal truth.

27:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Interestingly, he has been, his daughter has been a stork. They only eat red meat and salt. It's the only thing he drinks and eats. And has done for years and has reversed multiple diseases. His daughter's hips had been replaced when she was 17 or something. And she had all sorts of problems. But yeah. I like him. There was a very famous interview he did on a TV show over here called Channel 4. And she was like, this woman, she was trying to get on top of him and like really berate him and stuff like that. And she's like, what gives you the right to have these, to like knock on people? And he goes, well, what gives you the right to make me really uncomfortable? This interview has been really, really tough. And she just goes, It was just, it was brilliant. It was a brilliant comeback. I don't know if I've actually ever seen her host another news station since. I think she got really unraveled.

29:02 - Jonathan Phillips 
If you like Jordan or not, he's very smart, he's very clever, and he's very entertaining to watch. Really entertaining, especially with his debates, he's phenomenal. Very, very clever guy. But whether you agree with him or not, that's another matter.

29:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I think he's provocative in making you think about things that are maybe uncommon. As JP said, whether you agree with his philosophies or not is probably not the point, but making you think in alternate ways is really important.

29:49 - Jonathan Phillips 
It's a problem at the moment with the latest generation, with council culture, is that if you don't agree with someone, people just get dismissed, whereas You've got to really bounce out and say, well, I agree with some things and not others, but hey, I respect the person for their opinion. And that's something that I don't think happens so much as it used to, potentially.

30:09 - Cuan Mulligan

So after logging in, we are redirected to the actual app where the admin can manage the organization data. That is the vendors, the departments, the accounts, projects, and spending category. And the admin can also add, all of the employees and boss of the organization, as you can see here.

2:18 - Nazif Barassounon 
That table show them all and you can filter the table by the names, as if for example, or by the role.

2:35 - Nazif Barassounon 
You can also add a new user.

2:41 - Nazif Barassounon 
Let's see.

2:46 - Nazif Barassounon 
I'm gonna...

2:51 - Nazif Barassounon 
Can you propose, I don't know, can you propose a username? Maybe yours?

2:59 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, please man.

3:00 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, there you go.

3:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

3:02 - Nazif Barassounon 
And for the email?

3:06 - Jared Cairns 
Would my real email cause any problems? Let me see if it'll go through. It's just karensjared1 at Gmail. Oh, yeah. It's how my last name is spelled. So it's C-A-I-R-N-S at the beginning.

3:54 - Nazif Barassounon 
yes and next I can give you some rule here here is the available rule from now employee admin and sign a user can be an admin and also be a signer that will allow the actual boss to manage the account if you want.

4:23 - Nazif Barassounon 
After that I can select a default department as you requested like molecular biology.

4:35 - Nazif Barassounon 
Given that the current user is I don't think we should assign to him a supervisor so we can let it as it is. I don't know what you think.

4:50 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, sometimes there's people, yeah, if you have admin rights, that's kind of irrelevant if you have a supervisor for pretty much any use case, so I think that's okay. As long as it's okay to leave blank, I think that works.

5:02 - Jared Cairns 
I guess the one situation would be If this person is submitting a request, so I guess just put in. I guess in the situation this person be submitting a request, they should have a supervisor because their request should go to somebody. I mean, I feel like you would coach most people to just not do that, but in a small organization, sometimes those roles might overlap.

5:29 - Nazif Barassounon 
OK, so a signer can have another signer, for example, as a supervisor.

5:35 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that would probably be how it would work. Okay. And if I was like in the admin role, you could just, I mean, yeah, I guess you could have a signer to a signer. I don't think that would happen often, but it could.

5:51 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay. So let's do that. I know that Sophia Davis is a signer, so I will assign to you.

6:03 - Nazif Barassounon 
so as a signer should we have an approval threshold too or the signer can just sign the contract that he had yeah so there should always be another level basically no matter what and I'm assuming that's what this is

6:22 - Jared Cairns 
it's approval threshold or that's if I received something on the second level or more. And then this would just be based off whatever my job title level would be. I would just put like 10,000 in there for now. Okay.

6:40 - Nazif Barassounon 
So let's submit it. You should get your credential through that email.

6:48 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, I have it open right now.

6:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, here we go. Got it.

6:57 - Nazif Barassounon 
So the thing is, I'm in the local version of the app.

7:09 - Nazif Barassounon 
Oh, yeah. No worries.

7:11 - Nazif Barassounon 
So you can just use the credentials in the live version.

7:16 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that's easy.

7:23 - Nazif Barassounon 
And of course, after confirming the email, there is actually a link for that.

7:34 - Jared Cairns 
Try to log in on the library. Oh, here we go.

7:47 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, yep, that login just worked, so I'm in now.

7:51 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay, so in the contract page, you can see all of the contract. My actual user is only an admin, so we don't have the ability to add new contract for now. But you should have the possibility to do it. I can see it, yeah.

8:21 - Nazif Barassounon 
So at the right, the top right, you can just pop up to the form and add the contract.

8:32 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, you want me to add one right now?

8:56 - Jared Cairns 
There we go, that's the kind of bullshit I can catch.

9:20 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, it's just making me attach something. Let me just save something down.

9:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Peace.

10:11 - Jared Cairns 
me to attach a PDF and I'm just trying to save like a blank.

10:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see what I'm doing wrong.

10:56 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, I just submitted it now.

10:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

11:03 - Nazif Barassounon 
It should appear in the list of contract. So at the beginning, we assigned to your account a supervisor called Sophia. So I will just log in as Sophia and see if I can just approve it.

11:45 - Nazif Barassounon 
of that after so now I'm logged in as Sophia and as you can see there is a toggle here when you can see all the pending approvals when you toggle it I can see your contract here so let's view it I can take a look at your contract here it is if all is good and done I can just sign it because I'm actually a signer so you are it doesn't need to go through many people because I'm a signer so I can just sign it directly The contract is signed you should be able to See it if you refresh the page. Yeah, and that's active for me Okay So you can also check out your email. I think there is a notification when The contract is approved or signed.

13:17 - Nazif Barassounon 
Oh Yeah, I got it, okay cool, okay OK, so the other use case I want to show you is when you have an employee that is under you and he adds a new contract, you should get also a notification by email saying that you have a new contract to be waiting for approval. Do you want to see the flow?

13:55 - Jared Cairns 
No, I think it makes sense. I would just see it with me submitting. Do you have an account that shows that same thing? Because I just submitted one to whoever Sophia's email would be. But I'm not too concerned about that. I mean, it seems like it makes sense.

14:16 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay. So...

14:23 - Nazif Barassounon 
Let me login as a admin again.

14:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Those are some nice oak trees.

14:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
So this is basically it.

15:13 - Nazif Barassounon 
In the demo I just made, it was just one user. For the contract approval flow, it was between two users.

15:29 - Nazif Barassounon 
I was able to sign because I was granted the signer roles. If it was actually just an employee, An email will be sent to each supervisor.

15:49 - Nazif Barassounon 
And if this supervisor is also an employee, it will just send an email to each supervisor, so on, until it reach and sign. This can just sign and the approval form is completed that way. I don't know if that makes sense.

16:13 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, so it basically is following up through whoever your approver or your supervisor is assigned until it reaches somebody who's a signer. And they're basically set up now. Yes. And is there anything? So what is this approval threshold feed off of right now?

16:29 - Nazif Barassounon 
Is this? Yeah.

16:31 - Nazif Barassounon 
Is this functional right now?

16:34 - Nazif Barassounon 
No, no, it's not functional right now. But I think the logic behind it should be kind of, let's say if at the beginning, the contract is set to $10,000 the current approver have a threshold of $6,000 I can have it subtracted to the amount and it will be left another $6,000 right and if the next approver have let's say a threshold of $10,000 and it's only left $5,000, I think we should sign directly the contract without moving it to the next approver, right?

17:55 - Jared Cairns 
Like let's let's say it's a three-person team. Let's say first person has 5,000 second person has 10 third person has 20. Let's just say that's their thresholds that they can approve If the first person puts in a $25,000 contract it's gonna go through 5,000. They don't have enough to approve it and it's their own first person is always zero basically because you can't just submit a contract without any supervision so it goes up 10,000 still too low third person 20,000 still too low so it needs to go to even that person's boss now most companies wouldn't have those bands so small just because everybody would be bogged down doing this bullshit all the time but that's basically the logic so basically once it And let's just, for example, say that between this low level employee with 5,000 and the signer, let's say the signer is the CEO, let's say there's 10 employees in between. And you get to that fourth employee, they have enough to approve the $25,000 contract, they approve, it skips everybody and goes to the signer at that point. Somebody with the threshold to approve on behalf of the company has improved all the way up. But otherwise, yeah, the role, basically the employees skipping to the signer, that part's right. The only part to implement is the threshold piece, I think, which is like another layer on top.

19:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I see now. Yeah, I think, yeah.

19:24 - Jared Cairns 
For some logic that you build, there could potentially be negative contracts if you're cutting back a contract or canceling it. So you might have a contract that's negative $100,000 So just something to keep in mind that I would say in that case They should always just default to one person submits next approves and then sign so like one two three But they don't need to go up through high amount of changes Those Yeah, it should be able to scale up basically indefinitely. So it shouldn't be an issue. It's basically initially driving off the approval threshold that each person has and then up to being successful. At the very end. And if there's steps to skip in between, that's kind of the trickier part, I guess.

20:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

20:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll send it to you in the group chat. We can work on it afterwards.

20:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

20:59 - Jared Cairns 
Otherwise, it makes sense to me.

21:03 - Nazif Barassounon 
OK. So this is where we are currently at.

21:10 - Nazif Barassounon 
I'm planning to work on the build section next.

21:16 - Nazif Barassounon 
So if we can just have a refresher around this feature, that would be really great.

21:25 - Jared Cairns 
Okay. Yeah. Do you want me to just top to bottom or is there anything specific you guys want a refresher on? Top to down would be good. Yeah, so let's say, I guess we could use, if there's that contract I just entered in here, I guess these are users, but let's just say I had a contract that I just entered for the $15,000. So let's say that bill has come and let's say that it's, let's say half of the bill is due, so $7,500. I want to be able to, and this one should have a start and end date in here as well. Not necessarily important right now. But basically instead of, as you have all these contracts, you want to be able to track how much you spent against them and how much is remaining left on them. So in this case, $7,500 bill for 50%, let's say just came in. So I'm the person who wants to pay bills and I'm going to go in and enter it and make sure that one, it's recorded somewhere to this bill for $7,500. I don't know anything about this contract. I've never seen it before. I want to see that it exists at all, that it's a service that our company has agreed to, that somebody has an idea of what it is. And because I've already entered this information, when I entered the contract, I'm the owner. This should basically populate what's in the bill field. But the bill part is really only It's really only important because we need to afford most of the reports that we run later. So when we go to look at doing financial adjusting entries and reporting out financial statements, based off these contracts and the periods that we're incurring the expense in, we need to know how many bills we paid and posted. I won't bore you with all the details, but we need to know how many bills there have been for what amount to adjust for those to make sure that our calculations are correct on the financial side. So basically we just need a listing of those as they come through and an easy way to track them back to this contract.

23:35 - Jorge Lewis 
I think a good way to wrap our heads around it again is the CSD file or the Excel sheet that you sent.

23:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, let me see it.

23:48 - Jorge Lewis 
When you sent it before, Oh, that doesn't seem like it.

24:34 - Jared Cairns 
Oh yeah, here we go. Okay, so look at what you just sent.

24:40 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, so on the left is essentially what the bill entry form is looking like, So a lot of that stuff, basically everything that's blue, is being fed directly from that contract entry form. So that should basically just be a one-to-one. Once you select the contract, you're billing it to. And the pieces you would input below are kind of as described to be. Date the invoice is sent, when the payment is due, the amount of the invoice.

25:12 - Jared Cairns 
I guess currency would be good to add in here, but accrual period, posting period, PDF at the bottom, and then simple submit and reject button.

25:25 - Jared Cairns 
But I know this is basically when we were talking about this very early on, we were talking about instead of having this importing this data, but it was just it's just so much easier, I think, to just have this module built into the system. Instead of having to worry about all these different billing systems that come in, I think it's a lot easier to tackle the problem of entering the billing data and then figuring out how to get those bills paid later, because there's a million tools to do that versus bringing it in, which is a way bigger pain in the ass. So Basically, this is just to kind of help organize and approve these bills. And then, you know, on a weekly basis, whatever 50 bills or whatever getting paid out and approved by that's a that's a downstream function that we're not is not really in the scope of this project right now. But this is really just to make the calculation on the contract reporting easier, make the bill entry easier, and kind of all the approvals related to the contract within the same system, same interface. Consistent and easy is kind of the goal.

26:32 - Nazif Barassounon 
And what should actually happen when a bill is rejected?

26:39 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, it's a good question. So usually the person entering the bill at the very beginning is usually not has not been associated with the contract. At any point in the past, they're usually in the accounting department, different department, they're not a part of a chemistry contract that gets rejected. It could just go back to that person and notify them that it's rejected and sit in a queue to be resubmitted, or deleted, I guess. And then if there was reject with a little notebox where they could say, this amount is wrong, or this work was never performed, or something like that, that's useful too. But basically reject it, send it back to the very beginning of the queue to be resubmitted again would be great. And then when it's in that queue, Basically, be able to have to edit it, resubmit it, and or just delete it. If it's a fraudulent invoice, for example, you would just want to delete it and not enter it.

27:38 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay, so given the notes that will be associated with the rejection, the user should act accordingly, right?

27:54 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah.

27:56 - Nazif Barassounon 
So can we say the same for the contract? If a contract is rejected, should it restart all the approval flow and grant the user the ability to edit it?

28:09 - Jared Cairns 
I think so, yeah. And then you can just restart it. It can just basically start the approval workflow again, give them the ability to edit, and then restart it once they hit submit.

28:22 - Jared Cairns 
OK.

28:23 - Jared Cairns 
And then any of the old data, that was entered the first time doesn't need to be saved. I know we're doing that on another part of the project, kind of saving versions of it, but we don't care about, for this case, we don't care about any of those draft versions. It can just be completely reset and then submitted again.

28:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

28:42 - Nazif Barassounon 
All right.

29:06 - Jorge Lewis 
How's the new job?

29:11 - Jared Cairns 
It's pretty easy so far. Knock on wood. It's been pretty decent. There's actually this really fucking sweet gym downstairs that has like this as like an outdoor basketball court like a overlooking this huge valley in San Diego. It's like a fucking, what's that?

29:31 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah.

29:33 - Jared Cairns 
And the same building. And then right out behind is just this full outdoor basketball court, literally like caged in overlooking this valley. It's like crazy. It's like, it's like, um, right next to this big app, like the big Apple campus in San Diego. So it's like all these, thousands of Apple employees or whatever. And then this literally tiny little like shotgun building that we work in. Hilarious. And then the one company in between us just shut down. They literally are relocating their employees to Japan if they want their job.

30:27 - Jorge Lewis 
You guys want to go through the Excel sheet?

30:40 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah and I can… I probably know it a little bit better. I can share. Hold on one second.

31:03 - Jared Cairns 
That's basically just what I'm imagining would be needed on like a database level. Like I'm imagining that's what it looks like on the back end. I'm imagining that's kind of the listing that we'd get from these forms, but let me share this.

31:31 - Jared Cairns 
Give me a second here.

31:37 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, my computer's frozen momentarily, but hopefully it comes back.

31:49 - Jared Cairns 
Windows.

31:50 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, here we go.

31:53 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, literally. Okay, let's see here.

32:03 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, can you guys see this? No. Now we can. Okay. Yeah, so essentially this other form just turned on its side, kind of

32:21 - Jared Cairns 
But I really just line the data up like this because it's easier to create these other reports in Excel when stuff is aligned this way. But really, this is just basically the data fields that I would imagine that I would need sitting somewhere to be summarized from But yeah, this is just all the same data from the bill, from this bill form or the updated bill form that I showed you. I know we've made some changes since then.

32:53 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that's really all there is to this. I really created this just because to help populate some of the example reports and the other stuff that I had in here. Like this one is just based off the build data.

33:27 - Jared Cairns 
But really, the reason the bill data is important is because, yeah, I mean, boring accounting bullshit, right? But let's say we have a contract that's fully incurred, $60,000 contract, and we want to book $60,000. To our financial statement. I think your screen is frozen.

33:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it for you guys?

33:59 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, it is. I can see it's frozen here. Let me stop and then try again.

34:08 - Jared Cairns 
Let's see this guy.

34:14 - Jared Cairns 
Okay. This one better.

34:22 - Jared Cairns 
So basically, the reason that the build data is important to have. So for example, we hide all of this for now. Ignore all this for now. And we just say, we have a contract.

34:39 - Jared Cairns 
And in our tracking of it, we want to be able to track the amount, copy of the contract, have the dates, the account it goes to, department it goes to, kind of all this data that we want to have.

34:54 - Jared Cairns 
which is all well and good. We also want to be able to book this. We also want to be able to basically attach it to our financial statements and present this data. To do that, we need this total contract, like I said, the dates that we have it, and how much we want to book to. So in this case, in this example, we're running, saying, all contracts as of 6-30-24. In this example, this contract is ending 6-30-24. So 100% expense, $60,000.

35:31 - Jared Cairns 
So if we build $40,000, basically when those bills come in, they create a journal entry in your system, basically.

35:42 - Jared Cairns 
I don't want to bore you with the double entry bookkeeping because it's going to just bog it down more. Basically when a bill goes through it's creating something you have to adjust for Usually it's it helps you in some cases in every case you have to adjust for it. Usually it's helping you So really, we need to know the bill amount so we can calculate this amount, which is what we need to book to, this 20,000, which is the reason we need the billing in the first place. Because every company enters bills, pays bills, every single system on the earth makes these adjustments from the bills. So we need to be able to make these adjustments from our system on the contract side. But that's basically the reason the bill data is necessary.

36:37 - Nazif Barassounon 
What do you guys think?

36:38 - Nazif Barassounon 
I'm a little confused by the last two columns, the booking amount and the open amount.

36:50 - Jared Cairns 
I don't really know what it means. Yeah, so the open amount is really a really easy calculation. It's basically here's your contract. Here's how much has been billed against it. Assuming no changes. Here's how much you're expecting to bill. So pretty simple. You have a $60,000 contract. You've been billed $40,000. You're expecting to still be billed $20,000. What's the practical use for knowing this? If you had 300 contracts and your CEO wants to know what's our open liability balance? How much are we going to pay out on all the contracts we have? You can just say this much. Basically, the total of this column. This one is a little bit confusing because it is the same right here. But if I do this, if I have this hooked up right, this changes. We try to make this first one really simple. Basically, it's $60,000 for six months of fees, basically $10,000 every single month. So easiest way to think about these bills would be you have $10,000 billed. Let's say these are the bills that are getting entered for January, February, March, and April. And you're closing the books for May. You don't have time to chase down every single vendor, get all this shit posted. You basically have to close this down so you know what your adjustments are that you need to make. There's basically so much stuff going on. You need to close down posting your bills so you can make these adjustments, report financials, and move on to the next period. So you'll notice the open is still 20 because we still have a $60,000 contract. We've still paid 40. We still have 20 open. So that's not going to change if we change the accrual amount. This is moved to 10,000 because we're basically accruing for this one extra month, May, which is not represented in this 40,000. We're missing it here. So because we know, in this case, six months of chemist fees, and we have got bills for four of them, it's the end of May, which we know from this right here. It's the end of May. We know we have a contract for a bill every single month. We're missing May. We're missing this 10,000. Basically what this is being booked from this. So we have this report. We know we need to book 10,000 more. And this is kind of the underlying logic right here. But then, as you can imagine, explode that up to 300 contracts. And that's kind of the daily struggle that people have in booking this stuff regularly. And as you can imagine, it's never quite as simple as six months for an even flat 10,000. It's never as simple as they've sent you a bill every month. It's the same amount. It's usually a lot bigger of a pain in the ass.

39:54 - Jared Cairns 
And then I guess just to drive it home a little bit more, let's say we were doing this as a 430 at the end of April, then this amount will be zero because we've already captured those four bills. We don't need to worry about May, that's in the future. We have basically four months worth, four bills worth, so there's no accrual at all.

40:15 - Jared Cairns 
I don't know if that helps at all, but I know this part's the most confusing part.

40:23 - Jorge Lewis 
It's the simplest equation. Like, it can't be explained with one equation, but it's the most confusing part somehow.

40:29 - Jared Cairns 
Don't worry about it. It's definitely the most confusing.

40:35 - Jared Cairns 
It's why a system doing it is really useful. It's why a system doing it is very useful.

40:43 - Nazif Barassounon 
So...

40:47 - Jared Cairns 
Do we need to suppose each time that it will be a monthly basis billing No, so all you need is the summary how much has been billed total So basically this just needs to be a summary of all the bills against this contract and the tricky part that we talked about on the last call was that like I said, I You need to know when to cut it off. I would say just make basically, you know, if you're running this as of 5-31-24, any bill that has a final approval timestamp 5-31-24 or before, bring in. Anything 6-1 or after, leave out, is what I would say. Because otherwise, this number will continue to change as your operations go on in your business.

41:41 - Nazif Barassounon 
So basically, when we have an interval for a contract, we should make sure that all of the billing that is entered respect this interval, right?

41:59 - Nazif Barassounon 
What do you mean by interval?

42:01 - Nazif Barassounon 
The beginning of the contract and the end of it.

42:07 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah.

42:10 - Jared Cairns 
It's hard because there's sometimes where you'll have a contract that like in biotech, you see this in manufacturing where you're basically signing a contract to get a spot to start manufacturing in six months. And so let's say, The start date would be 12-1-24 if we were doing it this year. But you're paying on 6-1-24. But this is when manufacturing starts. This is when payment is due. So you may have a bill that's paid way in advance of basically the start of the interval of the contract that you still need to account for. In our world, we'd call this a prepaid. It's a prepaid asset for that contract. But the nice thing is you can capture it the same way just by having...

43:05 - Jared Cairns 
So like if I did this, this negative would be like a prepaid. So in the same example, let's say I'm looking at this as of January 31st and in this case I've still paid $40,000.

43:25 - Jared Cairns 
But because I've only you know, I'm only one month into the contract. I'm way over in this case. It's negative From a financial perspective.

43:32 - Jorge Lewis 
That's an asset That's right or or before but yes exactly. Okay.

43:35 - Nazif Barassounon 
Oh I think That doesn't make sense, actually. Okay, perfect.

45:08 - Jared Cairns 
This part's the most confusing. And I mean, like, you guys aren't alone. Like I said, the only reason this software be valuable is because nobody really understands this, even though you're required by law to do it every single month, you're required by law to report it to your investors. CEOs, I've been in CEOs explaining this in boardrooms with CEOs. It's just not that intuitive. It's pretty fucking confusing actually. But you are required to do it by law. Every investor that you've ever talked to in your life wants to see basically this and the underlying piece. So yeah, no worries. Like I said, I'm happy to explain this stuff.

46:04 - Jared Cairns 
This is the crossover, exactly, and this is really the main selling point of the software, I guess, is this, along with being able to update.

46:16 - Jared Cairns 
If it's not clear, these dates also drive this calculation. If I were to change this right here, that's going to change. These dates, in reality, change all the time.

46:30 - Jared Cairns 
You know, just that's how shit shit happens. Yeah, exactly. Shit. Do we do it and make it longer than start working about in the application or do we just have to understand how to calculate it?

46:44 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. And I think the calculation itself is simple because I would say if you were getting to, so this is like, this part right here is like truly the final, final, Like the final final output, but I don't think like to get to this point You probably need to understand a little bit more. I don't think we need this if you spit this into Excel by itself you could just like a pivot table could get you that like it's not a big deal anybody that does accounting can do that in five seconds so that's not the end of the world that's more like a like a nice way to look at it but this yeah I think it's a good point As long as you're following know how to calculate it I don't think you necessarily need to understand it because it's really just for this one report. Yeah, and It's basically just straight lining all this information. So for every single one, it's basically the same. Oh poking around yeah yeah for the billing part so we can introduce a new role like accountant yeah I think that would be That's good. Or like...

48:38 - Jared Cairns 
Account would be good, I guess, yeah. And then they have the ability to enter bills. For roles, you could probably just make a list of each role you want and which permissions they should have. Which responsibilities they should have. Yeah, I think this would be the only other one that I could think of Maybe just one more for... I mean, even if you just gave this permission to the employee, I mean, it wouldn't be the end of the world to do this. Plus, if there's approvers, you're protected from downside risk. So I don't think it's that.

49:22 - Nazif Barassounon 
So if I understand it correctly, if an employee, for example, adds a bill, it will be the same approval process as the contract, or should we separate it?

49:37 - Jared Cairns 
Same approval, same approval process, same approval thresholds.

49:44 - Jared Cairns 
So if it's like in our example earlier, if it's 5, 10, 20 it's 25,000, same thing for the bill. If you're entering the bill, it goes through those people, it's running off that same threshold. The only difference is that it doesn't have to go to a signer at the end. So basically once it reaches somebody with enough threshold, then it's approved or posted or whatever.

I don't understand what you're saying.

3:48 - vitor 
Ah, we have yesterday because a lot of clients ask us for that and they always hires or contracts some platform and me and Guilherme think like, oh if we had this platform we can like get a lot of payers, you know?

4:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Now this company has like a hundred thousand leads My clients.

4:33 - vitor 
Just one company has this job because they are in all Brazil. How many stores they have? About six? Yeah, like six different cities in Brazil.

4:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

5:10 - vitor 
Usually they say, oh, this company who provides the service is pushing like $3,000 per year just to make email marketing. And they say, ah, it's too expensive. We need to search another company who this and we find a lot of companies who do this but we think ah we can do something better because we work on this you know we can do something more more Something

6:20 - Jorge Lewis 
like this, yeah, but...

6:23 - vitor 
They don't wanna pay this anymore because it's too expensive for them just to have email marketing. They wanna pay something like... A hundred per month, something like that.

6:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm. But it's a hundred per month. How many clients do you think you could get onto the platform yesterday?

6:50 - vitor 
How many customers? We'll have to make some calls, but at least... I don't know. How much clients do you think, Guilherme? Guilherme? How much clients do you think we can arrange for this platform? How much clients do you think we can arrange for this platform?

7:06 - Jorge Lewis 
How many clients do you think we can arrange for this platform?

7:08 - vitor 
How many clients do you think we can arrange for this platform? How many clients of 4 maid group and more about the 6 name of cup stores. But it's just a tip that they're going to give. How many tips can we put? I had two accounts in the first month, but... After we came... Like, for right now we can arrange something like... 2 by 5 coins. But... Like... Something that...

8:13 - Jorge Lewis 
In three months you can put a lot of coins.

8:26 - vitor 
So, for instance, annual plan. Like monthly plan we can charge, you can, like, can be But, at the moment, low-cost housing is too expensive, around 250 per month. Yeah, per month we can, like, charge more, you know. Per year we can reduce the price.

8:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so, if you have a house on the island, I can't hear you so well.

9:15 - vitor 
Your audio is like...

9:16 - Jorge Lewis 
We want to create this software like...

9:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
What do we think?

9:34 - vitor 
We can put this to our world. Our world can use, but in Brazil they really want to use. And what do we think about? Like, we can do the website, the traffic, the ads. You guys can create some platform if you can.

9:51 - Jorge Lewis 
And we can share the money, you know?

9:55 - vitor 
Like 50-50, something like that.

9:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Because it's something that we can build together.

10:33 - vitor 
We can create like a chat tip key, but in WhatsApp to specify. Specific confidence, yeah? Specific niche.

10:47 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you think about? Yes. But you're talking about something else.

10:58 - vitor 
No. In the same CRM... CRM? CRM? CRM. We can put a chatbot with artificial intelligence, yeah? It's easy or not.

11:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Oops. Yes or not? What do you think?

11:22 - vitor 
We can use a... We can use a... What's the name of the...

11:28 - Jorge Lewis 
API of ShaggyPT and put in the software. Yes. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. I'm back. I'm back. OK, OK.

12:02 - vitor 
How's it going, Coke? So good. Right now, I already received a message from an Airbnb owner, Airbnb host. We are seeing some apartments to Vietnam.

12:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice. I need to go. Yeah, we don't prepare a visa yet because we need to rent some apartment or hotel to get the visa. Yeah, yeah. And how is Shanghai, man?

12:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Shanghai?

12:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like always. And the Jonas girlfriend? What? A lot of time. A lot of time he's... They are together?

13:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

13:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Like today? Yeah. Oh my god. Lunch, lunch. Yeah.

13:19 - vitor 
We've been seeing her lately now.

13:22 - Jorge Lewis 
He already kissed her or not?

13:24 - vitor 
I don't know.

13:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know. Oh my god.

13:32 - vitor 
in vietnam probably he wants to bring her to vietnam bro a lot of russians get russian girls in vietnam but we have to talk about business first then we we talk about We can buy a chatbot in Colt Canyon.

14:01 - Jorge Lewis 
You know the site?

14:03 - vitor 
What is it called? Colt Canyon.

14:07 - Jorge Lewis 
It has a lot of ready codes to buy it.

14:11 - vitor 
Yeah, yeah. It's cheap. We can buy a CRM and we don't know how to put this on, yeah? Put this how to we can buy their CRM works we don't know how to do it but I think the guys know how to do it like we can buy the code buy everything but we can we we like

14:41 - Jorge Lewis 
we don't know how to put this to work you know like on a website or something I'm going to eat. Are you ready? What? I'm going to eat. Describe to us. We are WordPress.

15:15 - vitor 
We are a community of WordPress. It's something simple. We just need a CRM and a chatbot to access. We can train the chatbot only to answer the niche questions.

15:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Because this website has a lot of things that We want to know. You can just copy.

16:27 - vitor 
We can create a micro-test, which is software, and put two words. See how it works, and then we can put more function items. Yeah? But we have to do a first... First...

16:56 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, how is the name of the... MVP! What?

17:01 - vitor 
MVP! Yeah, we can put a first MVP and then we see how it works.

17:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Say again, say again please. Like, we're so busy right now with all of our other businesses that we don't know if we'll be able to have enough time to make this broadcast.

17:43 - vitor 
It's not like a million dollar idea, it's like a thousand monthly dollars idea, you know? It's just a sandpaper, no?

18:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Something like that, not a million dollars, you know? Don't worry, bro.

18:18 - vitor 
When we have time, you can see this with more patience and think more about and we can see what we do, you know? Yeah we we think about it too it's like you you say we we planned the platform like you say we search some platform that is working right now and we like I don't know. We send our clients into this platform, like to a Reddit platform, and state some percentage about the client. But what? Fuck. It's like our second option, you know? Our first one. We will think about it like last night.

20:01 - Jorge Lewis 
We will think about it. So, ah, let's talk to Jorge and see what he thinks about it.

20:07 - vitor 
I think we have a lot of, a lot of Softwares like like this to sell in cold Kenya. We came back for test $30 We just have to put it work We buy for $30 and make $1,000 for I can't hear Say say say Yeah, that's a good idea too. But it's something that we just planned yesterday night. So we don't have nothing like 100% sure. We just talk about this with you to see what you think about. But until Vietnam and during Vietnam, probably we'll have more ideas to do together. Okay More more customized Country Like, that's what we want, you know?

23:33 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what I try to say for you. What? Probably yes, yes, yes.

23:54 - vitor 
Some, some platforms, sorry. Yeah, that's why I, I tried to copy something, you know?

24:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But, improve better. I'm not trying to make you cry, I 100% think we can make it better. This guy is probably one of the best users of the new technical experience, so if you're trying to make it, it's gonna be a little bit tricky, but it's what he does, and it's not very good, I think. So it's not gonna work. But man, I know it's just not gonna work, but it deserves a lot of love and people's support on it.

24:24 - vitor 
That's because your biggest client yesterday, like yesterday night, said like, hey, we need another platform and I will search for some platform this weekend and like, I will turn off this platform because it's so expensive. So we need another and we need to see for them.

24:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So ah, we can create one or we can search for another and try to... You can create one. What?

24:59 - vitor 
You can try to use the same one.

25:02 - Jorge Lewis 
No. Hmm.

25:20 - vitor 
What, what, what do you mean?

25:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, what, for, for how long, or? I can share my screen. Okay. Can you see? Yeah, yeah.

26:03 - vitor 
That's a good one, but we need something that we can put like API from Instagram to like we can capture the leads of websites, of Instagram, of some ads, and turn these leads into our marketing. Like, we can get the email, WhatsApp, and make some email markets, or send some message on WhatsApp. From Google AdSense or Meta AdSense or Wi-Fi. It's like a platform that is used a lot in Brazil. Like you enter on Wi-Fi, but to have access for Wi-Fi you need to put your email or number. You find some new platform and like we can signature this for a month or I don't know because our client need this like to to this week you know So it has to be fast. So we can tell them, ah, buy this one, and we can look in the platform and see what they have best, what they can improve better.

27:48 - Jorge Lewis 
What can we fix and do the better one, you know?

28:06 - vitor 
yeah EBI so we we can take this new platform and record something to you guys and pass the information and see what we can prove better our ABBI's Yeah, will you try to learn more about this this new platform

28:37 - Jorge Lewis 
and send more information to you guys I Or lunch bro. LUNCH AT FIVE! What time do you usually wake up? Uh, eleven. Yeah, me too.

29:10 - vitor 
Huh, Jonas wakes up any minute.

29:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas is falling off, right? It's a little weird for you because he's your own friend, like he lived with you and now he's with another girl. Yeah. From here to Bangkok.

29:27 - vitor 
We have a good sofa here.

29:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas will need a king-size bed because now he's growing. Yeah, yeah. We can squeeze on a small bed. So you'll come to Bangkok or not? But you can take a train to Bangkok and stay with us like a weekend.

30:30 - vitor 
We can take a train for an extension here.

30:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Huh?

30:34 - vitor 
We can take a train for an extension. Yeah, but we can't stay here like a weekend.

30:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, ah, we'll pass a weekend.

30:40 - vitor 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a train to Bangkok is like $80. $8, sorry, Yeah.

31:36 - vitor 
what or where now when do you gonna leave yeah we live like 18 may yes May 18th okay you leave at May 18 because our last day here and we go directly to Vietnam yeah airport link is like next to here so we can take a metro directly to the airport Guilherme is recording a video and he wants you to say hi The boys work on Sunday, yeah? Every day, bro.

32:48 - Jorge Lewis

32:51 - vitor 
The guys work on Sunday, yeah?

32:53 - Jorge Lewis

Mon, Aug 26, 2024

1:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Morning, mate.

1:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
How are you?

1:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, you're on mute. I can't hear you.

2:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you hear me now? I can, DJ.

2:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
We have a really good vote of you. Cool.

2:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
exciting and frustrating because it like we get to go and then it does it's it where the biggest challenge I have using it is where there's no error in the function and yet it's not working but then it's wrong so there's nowhere I can't point at you I don't know where to go and tweak it so that's why I sort of went and created another Meeting and I stripped back all the chats and started to build it up incrementally to see if I could find out where it triggered and It just it's it.

3:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it doesn't make sense to me anymore why it's breaking Yeah, one thing I've been noticing while testing is that the advanced step hasn't been executing correctly, so I've made that a bit more reliable, just pushed that recently. I've also added a lot of debugging, so it's now showing the steps on the frontend, which made me realize another bug which I fixed. Oh, cool. I've run through your getting to know your why workshop for like 10 minutes now. It's almost addictive. It's been running very well. The only parts that I've had a problem with is parts I think that have to do with the prompt engineering or if not having enough context about the next step where it's like continuing to ask me about what's my true goal is even though I just gave it what I think the true goal is and I'm just saying the same exact question again. Exactly.

3:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So would that be prompt engineering?

4:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think so. When I said, I think, I told it straight up, I think we're going in circles here. What is your interpretation of what I told you? Then it told me its interpretation and moved on. So when I complained, it moved on to the next step. But without complaining, I think it would continue to go in circles and circles. I think if it had the context that visualizing the goal as the next step, it would have gone, oh, we should probably move on. But it didn't have that context. Yeah, there's one area.

4:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm trying to get it through the happy path. So I'd just say weight loss. And then it goes, how will it feel to have achieved that? And then when it starts asking me the score, it's asking me the score about my feelings, not the weight loss goal. And I've tried to call that the initial goal, but it doesn't seem to have, like, I don't know whether, is there anything in the prompt engineering where I can lock in a variable, for want of a better word, to say, when the user, when you clarify this, like if I look at, let me share my screen, it might be easier.

5:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, go on.

5:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So This is where I think it started to break where I started putting code in here if else To try to make sure that it through these scenarios. I don't know if that's a bad a bad idea to put things like that in there and I Don't know whether to put in like sort of giving an overview of the scenarios and then giving instructions per scenarios whether it's better practice to merge those into a If it's this, do that. If it's that, do this. I don't know the best prompt to write.

5:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
And if I...

5:52 - Jorge Lewis 
If it works, it works.

5:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

5:55 - Jorge Lewis 
If it works, it works.

5:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that's the problem right now. It doesn't work perfectly, right?

6:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is another version called the Y2 workshop where I basically made sure every step is just doing one thing. Yeah. And so... Saying hello initial goal and then playback right then ask why and I want to stop there And I couldn't even get it to run through this. So let me ref let me trash this and restart Yeah, now you can see the sketch is included. Yeah also interestingly If I have the why the other workshop running and i've given it my name This version thinks i've already it already knows who I am That's quite weird, since we haven't coded in any memory, apart from,

6:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
you know, like when the events, which is the messages, when you delete the messages.

6:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh yeah, you want the agent to speak first, right? The facilitator to like, oh, I started.

7:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
It'd be good. Interesting. You see here where it says, hello, Cuan. So I've done here, and this is just my learning, in the facilitator, People's names are always in sentence case, and it never picks it up.

7:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, you said always use lowercase for the word about, but I've noticed it uses only lowercase ever. It's not using the proper casing. In my entire conversation, it's just lowercase. I think Ritter always used lowercase and just ran with it and ignored the other parts. Okay.

7:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when using the word adapt, ensure, I'll leave that, ensure that ensure you use it in their workplace. Try that. Do I need to restart the chat now or will it?

8:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, it should be updated, but what may happen is it sees its previous message and emulates how it's been speaking before. Okay. So no.

8:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, now it's fixed.

8:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let's say kuhn is still lowercase, though.

8:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

8:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that's because you typed it in lowercase, so it's memorized. You typed it in lowercase. OK. Yeah. That's got to do with prompt engineering more so than implementation group hearts.

8:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I don't know why it's done that, because according to this, if I go here, initial goal.

9:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
So they shared the goal. They should be in step three now, and still in step two.

9:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I've said here, ask the user a question to establish what the issue is. That they have, what issue they have, what is it that they feel ADAPT can help with?

9:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so it seems to be going deeper. And I'm not entirely sure why.

9:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, maybe you need to specify that it doesn't need to go deeper, because the LLM kind of has its own line towards, like, diet needs more information.

9:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
if it doesn't feel like it has enough information. OK.

9:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then the other one is, when I was looking at this, and I was, you know, there's a lot of steps here. I'm on step 8. And I'm trying to debug step 8. It can take me 15 minutes to get down to step 8. Is there a way? And again, because you need the context of the other ones, you can't just do a workshop with just step 8. Is there a way that we can?

10:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't know, lock in a chat?

10:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like save checkpoints almost? Yeah, and go back to that point.

10:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that possible? Because that's going to make testing much faster.

10:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's possible, but yeah.

10:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like I'm thinking for JP's workshop, which is going to have multiple participants behaving in all sorts of different ways, this is going to be way more complex.

10:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, some kind of load checkpoint function that will go back in history instead of deleting the entire shot, deleting back to that point or something.

10:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, some version control or something to say, right? Say the chat here or breakpoint in the chat. That would be amazing.

11:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, what do you think, Jorge?

11:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we've mentioned it a couple of times before for IntelliAgent, so yeah.

11:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nope.

11:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
I need to lose weight.

12:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I was trying to create a format here by having a purpose, a how, and an example in the prompt. To be honest, it's not proving to be any more useful than the structured text I gave in the other example. I see no material benefit.

12:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I go back to here and trash this and start again.

12:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think there's improvement to be done in the facilitator prompts too, to properly separate the different sections, because now it's kind of just injected in the middle of a sentence. So if you're doing like several paragraphs, it may not understand that that portion is like the purpose if it's very long.

12:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this purpose here, for example, step two being very big, Yeah.

12:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Where, where, where would the problem down to the facilitator?

13:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
You can see hair. Your objective is to purpose until the desired outcome. So until the desired outcome may just be taking in like the last sentence and not be sensible. So I think this section is in the outcome. What's in this box.

13:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but as you can see down there, it's kind of in the structure of a sentence, but in the steps, the purpose is often multiple paragraphs, so it doesn't really fit into a sentence structure. So I'd imagine, I wonder if I update there, will it come live to you? Let me see.

13:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
like to review the full purpose and coach the user until the desired outcome has been received.

14:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you finding your why or your why to? No.

14:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
You see this formatting that you have here with the larger text. I'm assuming that has absolutely no bearing on the agent at all. It does actually.

14:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
The agent works in markdown, so the larger text has importance.

14:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
It highlights what it should focus on. But OK, can you see my updates live now if you scroll down to the facilitator prompt?

14:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
States.

14:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, it doesn't seem like it's coming in. Try to reload the page, maybe.

15:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, there, yeah.

15:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you could do something like your objective and this stuff.

15:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right.

15:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
And the way you're breaking this down and what you're using to write this, is this just your gut instinct or?

15:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's just gut instinct.

15:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Are you back in Hong Kong, Jorge?

15:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

15:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Been back here for almost a month now.

16:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is it hot there now or?

16:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh yeah, extremely.

16:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Right now, um... Oh, today's not so bad. 33 degrees.

16:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Um... Yeah, 80% humidity. Not so bad.

16:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I remember when I was in Hong Kong, we had, um, we were on our way to Australia and we had three days in Hong Kong. Um, myself and my two mates, we went out one night and we literally would go to a corner. We'd flick a coin, whether we go left or right. And we basically just went into all sorts of weird and wonderful places in the back streets of Hong Kong.

16:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Everyone has their own way to decide which street to go down.

16:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, But you see these people just sitting on the side of the streets, like wrapping crabs. And they just literally have a hole in the wall. And that's their home. And we went into this restaurant for dinner. And it smelled absolutely amazing. And there was all these big round tables. It was all shared seating. And they were trying to find cutlery for us. We're like, no, no, no. We can use chopsticks. It's fine.

17:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
We ordered this food, which we thought was like sort of sweet and sour chicken, stir-fried beef or something like this. Came out, smelled absolutely amazing. I wouldn't be the most adventurous of eaters, but my friends would be way more adventurous than me. And every single one of us, as we put the food in our mouth, we're like, this isn't fucking chicken. And this isn't beef. There was just something really, really wrong with it. Yeah, I don't know why, because I know some restaurants serve dog there. In Hong Kong, not really.

17:51 - Jorge Lewis 
No. In China, very few places, well, certain provinces, or sorry, not provinces, villages actually.

18:03 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a lot more prominent on the news than it actually is, as is anything.

18:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we end up trying, we end up going to I think KFC and even KFC is different there. They've got everything is spiced and got different stuff in it.

18:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know how you guys as McDonald's are, but the McDonald's in Hong Kong compared to the U.S. Is like, it's great. One of the U.S. Is terrible.

18:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
I remember there was, um, I think it was Burger King or McDonald's. One of them was doing a promotion where there was like a happy meal with a Snoopy toy. And there was literally just thousands of people queuing outside the restaurant to get them. They didn't care for the food, they were buying the food and just throwing the food in the bin to get the little plastic Snoopy. It's crazy. I remember, because we flew into Chepelot car, air-conditioned got into an air-conditioned taxi into an air-conditioned hotel and we were jet-lagged buggery and we were just in our Irish clothes like we were in it you know tops and we had jeans on and we literally went out for a walk and we were about maybe 20 paces away from the hotel and you could literally just see all of our jeans going dark with the sweat What time of year did you guys go down?

19:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

19:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
What time of year did you guys go?

19:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, gosh.

19:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think maybe August, maybe September. No, it would be the start of the summer. Maybe March, actually.

19:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, any month other than December to February is going to be hot, like hot.

19:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, and then we went up to Victoria Park. I had some dinner up there. That was nice.

20:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I've kind of written up what I think would probably be a better structure. It's kind of just out of intuition, but also kind of mixed with some of the frameworks that I've seen online, like CoStar having output formats separately from instructions. Separately from row and context. You might want to put in a description of what is the depth on the bottom there to the context.

20:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when we talk about adapt, is that, is that something that rag would be like, we'd have a document that this is what adapt is, what it's not when you're talking about food, you know, hair, we put in like, what is the depth or like, But should that not be central to all workshops as opposed to having to put that into each different facility? Like, would we want to have some shared context for every workshop rather than repeating it and having to change it like seven times if you've got seven workshops? Yeah, that's what it like,

21:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
It would be like context about workshop or and then it would be relevant context from document so that when it's running, depending on what the user is saying, it will catch the most relevant context using something like graph drag. Am I correct?

21:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
I wasn't catching that.

21:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
It was just catching the most relevant data about a workshop from documents instead of having to hard code it into the prompt.

21:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, using RAG. Yeah, for RAG, we don't want to be relying on that, really. What it's great at is for chatting with your documents, asking something very explicit. For things like context, that's usually not the best. That's best in the prompt. If the user isn't asking what is ADAPT, it won't give the definition. It won't know the definition.

22:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can we have a centralized context? So for example, in IntelliAgent, if JP's got like 100 workshops, he doesn't want to go into 100 workshops facilitators in order to update the same piece of context.

22:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we could probably use variables, like on the front end, make variables and then place them into text boxes.

22:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so we'd have, in terms of workshops, you'd have a centralized panel or a centralized or global variables section.

22:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I remember we were planning to make that for it.

22:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when I go into... Why is it not working? Yeah. So will this workshop builder be merged into this at some point?

22:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because the reason why we wanted like a central workshop builder platform that was independent from ADAPT and Intelligent, is that correct?

23:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because now that I see the power of this, I think this is something that we might want to figure out how we launch and sell independently. But if I build a workshop, I want to be able to build the workshop and use it in Adapt.

23:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I meant more like the workshop you create for ADAPT would be located in this workshop builder panel in a website instead of having to copy over all the code. We just keep it in one place and then through referencing from the database, we capture it into the ADAPT application.

23:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

23:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, you don't have to go deeper into how we'd integrate it in the other, in ADAPT and Intelligent. That's kind of the next step moving forward.

24:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because the reason why I'm asking is that there's, in the chat, like when I start chatting to this, there's a certain tone in a particular thing. And the current Adapt interface, where I can look at a chat and say, right, there's nothing wrong with what you said, but I prefer you to say it this way.

24:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's very difficult to, it seems more easy to do that in Adapt when I'm explicitly responding to a, or highlighting a piece of text that they've said. Trying to preempt the prompt in the workshop builder to say, if you ever say something like this, better to say it's something like that.

24:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
So let me try this thing.

24:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, this is all gone.

24:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Errors.

25:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
See, it's taking that weight loss conversation from here.

25:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
So I have to trash this.

25:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, is that on a different account, or what's the

25:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's my same account, but it's a different workshop.

25:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, OK. I see. Oh, that shouldn't be too much of an issue. It's just adding another filter that I probably forgot somewhere. That'll be fixed right after this meeting, probably.

25:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
But it really is quite exciting to see it and being able to go in and tweak it and stuff like that. Hi, my name is Maria.

25:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's asked two things there now. So if I go in, once the user names have been established, you can then also offer to tell the user. So it's not doing that. And it has been.

26:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is where I get very confused and I don't know how to tweak that. So if I stop this now.

26:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
And even in the facilitator, if I go down here.

26:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
We could even make that two steps, though. The second step could be offering to introduce the user. If anything, that's actually cheaper. You don't have to worry about paths to serve because that's less context in the prompt. That's where you'll have to learn how to use the workshop builder, probably better than both me and Jorge will, because you'll be using it a lot more.

27:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is probably the next feature that I need to have from you, which is I need to be able to put a step in between each of these. Because at the moment, I've got eight steps. And if I want to put something in here, it'll take me about two hours to put it in.

27:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, yeah. New step, and I'm copy-pasting everything now.

27:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that's sort of what I was starting to do. And it was becoming painful and just problematic. So if we can either create a step and then be able to drag it so you can change the order, whichever is easiest.

27:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
So are we saying, as a principle, a step should really only try to achieve one thing?

27:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, I think so, but that one thing can be like a combination of some things. It's probably what you're going to have to be testing since you're probably testing it more than I am at the moment. Of course, I am beginning also to test it, but...

28:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
So only after the user has shown... Can you send the end file for WB?

28:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Send the what?

28:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
The end file. Oh, environment type? Yeah.

28:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, Jonas, is the structure going to change at all to what it currently is in WB? How it is currently is all of it's clumped into the AI, and then we have graphs as the root one. Is that how it is going to be? Oh, we have graph and then memory.ts and then run.ts.

28:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

28:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So is that going to change at all when you kind of refactor or?

29:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
The file structure?

29:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

29:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Don't think so. The major thing that'll change is when I'm adding reviews. That'll be a new thing. Oh, reviews not yet.

29:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

29:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
That wasn't part of the POC. All right.

29:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
But you can see how that's kind of done in a depth, how the file structure is done there. Yeah, yeah.

29:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's a crash there now.

29:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Gateway time now.

29:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, it's...

29:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to come off my VPN, hold on.

29:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
You guys back now?

29:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
I'm here now.

30:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
I dropped off because I was on. I killed my VPN. And it does feel slower today than it did yesterday testing.

30:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
It feels slower? Yeah.

30:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, what servers are the... Where are the servers, Jonas? Because that might be...

30:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Sweden. Okay, no.

30:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
So it should be a password for QM, then it is for us. Yeah.

30:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
So yeah, so it's still lowercase, everything.

30:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, not the name, at least. Well, that's because I typed it in uppercase.

30:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's why. Yeah.

30:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Always use, oh, it's still the old always use lowercase for the word that, which didn't work earlier. So it might've came from like me editing it, but the first of it.

30:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Jonas, do we have the org for Startino on Superbase?

31:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
One moment.

31:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so this is something that it wasn't doing yesterday, and now it's suddenly doing it. Why is this goal... It's in step two, and if I look here at step two, it should be picking up That should have been scenario one. I want to lose weight. It's an explicit example.

31:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, maybe this is what it's doing here. Coach the user to understand why this goal is important to them.

31:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is too much in one step.

31:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how long would it take, Jonas, to be able to add a step within a step or to add in a step? Because that will allow me to tease out a part of this stuff as opposed to copying and pasting it.

32:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think it will operate one day.

32:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
If it's a drag-and-drop, probably closer to one day, because it's kind of a unique piece of web implementation to have moving UI when it's very structured HTML by nature. But a move button would probably be simple enough, but not over a day.

32:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I mean, if you can have just on a step and have a up arrow, down arrow, so you can just push it up and down.

32:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that's probably the easiest one.

32:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, if we can do that, that'll be really good because it's prohibitively complex to test at the moment. Also, the alternative way is that I go and I say, right, I'm happy with this. I go over to the Y2 workshop and I start to do it there and I build it incrementally. But at some point, I'm going to get, it's going to get wrong.

33:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I go over here, My name is Maria. I'm over here.

33:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm saying hello.

33:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So maybe I kill this one, and I start building it up over here until you've given us that ability.

33:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So did you facilitate your bot? No, okay, I need to.

34:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Has JP had any time to test the project yet? Nope.

34:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
He's been out with family. I think he should be around today. Alright.

34:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's definitely a UX issue in that when there's lots of text presented by the agent and it's just, boom, it just appears, it doesn't feel like a conversation.

35:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think we discussed that before, where it'll come as like a screen. Yeah.

35:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is stuff that we're going to do later. So why? So ask. So what they have, feel that that can help with. So the user has shared it to their goal. For me, step two is complete there. I don't understand why it's doing that and why it hasn't gone to step three. So can we try and do that? Because I don't think, I don't know how this is the prompt. It's very clear and it's very, very succinct.

36:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, it doesn't look like a clear goal. Like, I mean, to me, a clear goal is lose 70 kilos, not lose weight.

36:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so if I just shared, maybe the word clearest is causing it to do that. Yeah, I think so.

36:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Share their initial goal. Specify maybe that it doesn't have to be perfect. Just any goal is fine.

36:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's a difference here. Maybe you guys can help me.

36:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
I have been diagnosed with prediabetes is not a goal. I want to reverse my prediabetes is a goal.

36:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

36:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So will it know the difference between those?

37:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think definitely when reviews are incorporated, you can give examples like that.

37:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
So In the long term, from an infrastructure perspective, it shouldn't be an issue. Or from a fundamental standpoint, it shouldn't be an issue. It's more like to tackle. Yeah, so if I go here, for example, explain.

38:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let's see what it says.

38:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know what it is, but GitHub CY is so clean. I mean, sorry, Superbase.

38:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So looking at that, I would say there's qualities that it has a desire or intention to take action as a goal.

38:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

38:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, you could say like the goal must have colon expressive desire or intention dash list of requirements.

38:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what's the format of that?

38:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can enter and go down lines, right?

38:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

38:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
So how would I write that to say the goal?

39:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
The goal should have a colon, I think.

39:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, should the goal, the...

39:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
The should have goal. The goal should have goal.

39:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Should have, should...

39:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
express a desire or intention to take action to something like that. Yeah.

39:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
What's the point of the colon?

39:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
What does that do?

39:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, because the model is trained on mostly articles, mostly text on the internet, mimicking how instructions would be given to other people on the internet is a good way to do it, because then it's closer to what it's trained on. They're basically trying to mimic its training data, but nothing in particular, really. I just thought if you needed multiple requirements, then colon, dash, line, dash, line, dash.

40:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll let you guys go after this and I'm going to go and walk the dog and do more testing.

40:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

40:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's, I think I just need to get much better at the prompting and understanding that the structures that work.

40:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
thing now is like you've been testing a buggy system for like what two days and you've got like a pretty working workshop that's at least made me think when I run through it and such.

40:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's very very usable and it's very easy to tell it what to do there's just certain things we say right okay I've overloaded this prompt I now need to tease it apart I can't can't do this yeah I don't understand why it's doing that.

41:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think just explicitly tell it this shouldn't be a perfect goal, or just take the first goal the user gave you and run with it. Don't expand upon it, like tell it that explicitly.

41:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Represents stage is two, maybe two.

41:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
I can give the prompting a go if you want.

41:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Please, yeah.

41:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll edit the Y2 workshop a bit.

42:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, you get very bored writing in your fucking name all the time and then it gets abbreviated down just to a letter, whatever letter you hit on the keyboard.

42:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is it better to go happy path with weight loss the whole way through the program, or is once I'm happy with this step with weight loss, then I need to start doing it for lots of different issues and variations before we go to the next step?

42:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sorry, I didn't catch that. I was finishing the sentence.

43:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Should we go through the happy path of weight loss all the way through the workshop and then go back and start refining it for different scenarios? Or should I, once I'm happy that this step is okay for weight loss, should I then try pre-diabetes, try the, oh, I don't really know what problem, what problems could you help me with? You know, all those variations.

43:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Honestly, I don't know the best way to go about it, since this is such an innovative... I mean, this is the first time this kind of step process has been done. But how I imagine the way to go about it is refining one step at a time. But also once in a while going through the full process as you'd expect it to make sure that it's aligned with what you want in the long term. But since each step is so isolated from the other steps, probably when refining, I'd focus on one step at a time, but once in a while, make sure the whole workshop goes through as I expected to make sure the long-term vision of the workshop is still good.

44:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like, because in later steps, I say like, you know, ask the user to give a score between one and 10 their existing goal, not the future stage. Does it retain in memory what the initial goal is? Or is that, because if it's an LLM, it's always slightly fluffy. It's not very specific. So is there a way we can actually explicitly state, once you've this step, the output of this step is locking in this variable?

44:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that sounds like something that will be needed for basically all workshops, right? Yeah, I think so.

44:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

44:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
So that would probably be like a feature of the workshop builder that we'll have to implement, but it should be possible. Okay.

45:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um, yeah, it's still doing it. So I don't understand.

45:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's asking why it's important. Now I've tried to specify. What if I remove the make sure it fills the definition of a goal? Maybe that's throwing it off then. Ask the user a question to establish what issue they have, what is it they feel that can help with. Maybe it's the what is it they feel that can help with, which makes it go into like, oh, I should be going deeper. It's like all just theorizing about what parts of the prompt can be causing an issue.

45:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is just the initial goal, but you're also including that it should be asking what the devs can help with, which can be maybe conflicting for the LLM, because it's just going after the outcome, but it's also being asked to do something which is outside of the desired outcome.

46:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to get rid of that coaching offer as well, because it's just pointless.

47:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's just not letting go. The thing is, it wasn't doing this in the bigger workshop before. This is suddenly a new thing it's doing. How did it skip a step?

47:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, it's gone to step four.

47:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
purpose of the step is to show the user you understand their goal. It just skipped playback. I think what happened is it responded while expressing that it understood the user's goal, and then advanced step at the same time.

47:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
So it included advanced step in the playback message, which made it skip over that step, because when advanced step is included, it just ignores the message and goes to the next one. So what I think it did was it's, you'll need to somehow tell it to not include advanced step if it hasn't completed the current step or something.

48:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's an interesting issue.

48:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
In the back end, what happened was it went like, okay, I understand your goal, advanced step. And then it just jumped over that message because advanced step wasn't that message.

48:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

48:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that something that you need to fix?

48:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
It can be done in two ways, which is one, if anything but advanced step is included in the advanced step message, the rest of the message can be passed to the user. And then before advancing step, and then chatting again. The second way to fix the issue is just prompt engineering, telling it better how to use advanced step. Because currently, I think in the prompt, of the facilitator, all that's being told is, if the desired outcome has been reached, you must say advanced step, which means in the same message, it's completed the goal. It may include advanced step at the end of the message because it's like, okay, I completed the goal.

49:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Not for me following.

49:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

49:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
So the bot can complete the goal itself and in the same message advance step, which makes it jump over a step. So advance step happens twice.

49:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
I can kind of format it here.

49:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Basically, it made the message what was, okay, I understand your goal is to dot, dot, advance that. So that was its message. And because the message includes advance that, Yeah, it should be on your side.

50:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
You see that like section there under decide outcome where it's like quotation mark?

50:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
So because the text advanced step was in the message and it achieved its goal, it sort of skipped.

50:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

50:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, I wouldn't want that sort of issue to be in prompt engineering, that should be in the... That's functional in the background, isn't it?

50:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, what we can do is tell it, do not include events in the... In the message to the user for when you completed the move. Something like that.

51:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
But what I also can do is add some logic where when the person connected alongside advanced...

51:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, I need to go and walk the dog, so...

51:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you play with this and let me know if you can find a workaround?

51:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think either way, we'll probably want to pass the message it sent alongside advanced step when it's chosen to advance step and send the message to the user at the same time.

52:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because like with that solution, if you then decide to interrupt engineering, tell it not to advance step with a message, then that'll also work. So it'll fix both scenarios.

52:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what do we need to do then?

52:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think you can get it working on the prompt. I think you can sit there. This will be an implementation issue in the back end. I'll have to split up the message and push off of it. The part without the advanced stuff should go fine.

52:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you reckon that's something that you'll get done today or? Yeah.

52:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. And is there any sort of the step order? Is there any sort of dirty hack way that we could do that today?

52:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah, actually.

52:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
And I mean, it's very hacky, but you can go into the super base and edit the JSON manually and copy paste JSON up and down.

53:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
But that's very hacky.

53:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
But I think it should be download. Like, with just the up and down arrow button, I think I'll be able to finish that today, too. Let's assume. If not, early tomorrow, before you get up.

53:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because if I do some days, I'll fuck it up.

53:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
All right, again, if you can get this prompt advanced step issue fixing, then at least I can start playing with it and I can start being incremental with it before you release the next sort of step feature.

53:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Cool.

53:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
All right, cheers, folks.

53:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
See you. See you.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (5).txt"

0:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

0:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, Yeah, I've just done my ice bath, so I'm cold, but otherwise, otherwise good. I have a, I've had an ear infection for about six weeks now. So this ear is completely blocked. I can't hear anything. So I might do this because I can't hear, but

3:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay.

3:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. Um, so this is quite exciting, but also quite overwhelming in terms of what it's doing and how I interact with it and what I, how I tweak it or not. So, um, let me, let me take you through what I think I was trying to do. Uh, I'm just trying to load the page. Okay. Right. Let me see.

4:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you see that now?

4:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's coming up.

4:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I can see it. Cool. All right, so finding your y. And what I was trying to do was build a step, get comfortable with that step, and then build the second step, and third step, and fourth step. Yeah.

4:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
I copied these roles and supervisor roles from main because I didn't know any different. Um, I did actually create a second step last night because you can see here, it suddenly went into a second step. So let me just clear this down. Um, yeah, I changed this. It's not saving still.

4:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think I found the cause of the issue. It saves correctly to the database, but when the application reloads, it uses a local cache of what's been written, which is the previous cache and not the updated cache, and overrides it, and then saves it again, which deletes the changes. So I think I'm on the brink of fixing that issue. OK.

5:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. Makes sense. So does that need to be fixed before we test this? Because I think it's going to be really problematic if I'm doing stuff. Yeah.

5:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, absolutely. That should be. Or, well, what you do shouldn't be an issue because I'm testing on another workshop. But I imagine it's quite annoying and hard for you to test it when it's not saving properly.

5:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So if I say hi, just let's see where I get to here.

6:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, it's crashed. Which workshop is this? 517.

6:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
If I go back to finding your Y.

6:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Gateway Okay.

6:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, I want to change this text. So how much of this text is impacted by this purpose?

6:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
To explain kind of how the steps work, you can scroll down to the facilitator.

6:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's the one above there. This is the facilitator's whole prompt. And you can see that in the instructions, if you read them, it's saying you are currently in the step of the process. Your objective is to purpose until the desired outcome has been reached. Those curly bracket fields are being replaced by the text in the step above.

7:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

7:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what I don't understand is if the desired outcome has been reached, you must say advanced step and only advanced step. I'm assuming that's an internal messaging.

7:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

7:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
It doesn't say that.

7:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. So when it says advanced step and only advanced step, it advances the step in the database and then it calls the bot again with the new step. So with the new instructions.

7:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Well, that's not, this is a system message. It's not going to ever be displayed to the customer. The user?

7:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, no. Never.

7:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. That makes sense. OK. Yeah. And context message, you're creating a response for?

7:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
What does that mean?

7:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Message, you can read above in Facilitator. Message is the message the browser is responding to, so most likely the user's message.

8:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Right.

8:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
The message, hi, that you sent, is the one that gets entered in there.

8:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Fine. So that's the last message. That's all the history. Yeah. Is this not going to have a massive payload? You're including an increasing history of a very long conversation every single time.

8:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's an important task to rework that to use rag or knowledge graph, but it's not an urgent task since we're quite early in testing still, but when it launches to production, we'll, I think, or you should ask George about this, but on the notion, I saw the long-term memory thing was tasked up. So it's going to be implemented later down the road. And then the context window will be minimized and more smartly done towards just remembering what it should Yeah, because it could be a lot of garbage in there that's not needed to be retained.

8:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
It has no value. Fine.

9:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
But for now, we're just fitting everything in because that's the easiest way to test.

9:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that's fine. So consistently. Let's have them change this to traditional.

9:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't know if it will save properly now. I think I added some debug stuff. So if you had F12 on your keyboard, we can kind of see the commands that are being run on the background.

9:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
There, you can see it's saving the different steps with the updated data. And what I noticed is it's saving it correctly, and the database, it's being updated correctly. And then when the page is reloaded, it's overriding it with the old data. So it's some local cache that it uses, which it shouldn't be using. And I think I figured out where it's coming from

10:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

10:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so what I wanted to understand was the second step and how to tweak it, but I don't know whether we're gonna be able to do this until you've got that bug fixed. We won't know.

10:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
So what may work is like while you're editing the prompt here, never reloading the page and just talking with it in the chat. But I think everything you write will be deleted when you reload the admin page then. But for testing now, I think that works.

10:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
So for example here, if I've said, I think so, okay, let's proceed. It seems to double check. And I think it's because it's taking this fully understands and this is too strong a word. And so looking for re-confirmation after the user said, yes, like, are you sure? Are you really sure you're sure? And it gets into this cycle of like it's threatening for cut from moving to the next step seems very high.

11:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, you define that threshold. When the bug is fixed, obviously, you can edit that line, the outcome line, instead of saying fully understands, you can add it to when the user is ready to proceed or something.

11:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Again, so if I say the user confirms they understand and are happy to proceed. Just for example. So if I trash this, do you think this will use that text now or?

12:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's a little bit hard to know because it's on the deployed version locally. I can look at which prompts exactly were called.

12:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
But we can see if it advances when you say, I think so.

12:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
That's crashed something.

13:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think this means because there isn't a second step, it doesn't know what to do. You Yeah.

16:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
And it's sort of crashing now. Every time I try to send something, it's not working. So I'm wondering whether we need to.

16:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's because it's advancing into a step that doesn't exist. OK.

16:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I create a new step, which is basically establishing the users why I think what I had started to do was start copying and pasting this into notes rather than... Yeah.

17:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
But anyway, so I'll just say, okay, seek to understand why the user is signing up to the ADAPT program and what they want from it, why it's important to them. So the icon of the step is for the agent to be able to assess something, right?

17:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's for the agent to assess when to call the advanced step, which goes on to the next step.

18:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, good. Here. Trash.

18:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm going to be switching over to laptops, so I won't be hearing you for a second.

19:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you hear me?

19:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. So this is an odd question. This feels like it's been trained on, like your values or like, I don't know where this message came from and why it's doing that. So how do I tweak this?

19:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think tweak the instructions in the step. For the example, the instructions in the step is pretty like short, but I think you can expand it to be like quite a long piece of text inside the purpose. The purpose is kind of the whole instructions of how to go through it.

20:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Um, but can I see the question again? Let's start by understanding what truly drives you think about the time when the culture. Yeah. It's not really in line with what instructions you've had for the staff.

20:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. And when I did this last night and I had a second step, it was starting talking about what are your core values. Yeah. So it seems like it's taking, it's got an idea of what a value workshop is as opposed to this workshop.

20:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
So what I think is happening is because of the bug that's currently present, when you click New Step, it saves properly the new step of the default instructions, which is nothing instructions, basically. So it just kind of makes up itself. So I think it's got to do with the bug that I'm trying to fix.

21:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, let me jump off then. And you crack on. Just hit me when you've got that bug fixed, and we can try and reconnect.

21:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Perfect.

21:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, cheers. Bye bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (6).txt"

8:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hey, Jimmy.

8:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can't hear you, buddy.

8:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
How are you?

8:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Can you hear me? I can hear you now, yeah.

8:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
How are things?

8:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

8:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
How are things?

8:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
Are you feeling better?

8:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, yeah, I recovered last week, and I'm feeling way better. Thanks.

9:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. So what are the things you want to cover today?

9:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I wanted to talk about things that you also wanted to have a chat about, the daily mentoring, regarding daily mentoring. The check-in session, the long-term analyzer, and the, I think, part of milestones, if you want to cover it.

9:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, it's more important what you want to cover and what you need. Yeah, I want to cover majorly the check-in session.

9:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

9:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

9:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

9:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So do you have the link tomorrow? What I'm going to do is I'm going to rebuild the conversation in Figma Jam with you now.

10:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
But what I need, first of all, is the mural just to have reference. Actually, no, let's do it without the mural, because then we can see based on what is real today.

10:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
OK.

10:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do you want me to share my screen, or do you want to follow in Figma Jam as well?

10:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think I'm fine with if you share your screen.

10:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
I can follow you on Figma Jam, but my internet connection is not as good. So I think I'll get disconnected in between.

10:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me know when you can see this.

10:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I can see your screen. Go ahead.

11:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
We'll just use those three colors, one for the mentor, the coach, the user. All right.

11:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just give me a second. I'm gonna see if I can find the mural.

11:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Do you want me to share the link? Yeah, that'd be really useful.

11:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

12:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
I think I have it here.

12:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

12:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
How do I change the... Oh, there it is, finally.

12:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

14:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what are we going to do?

14:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so we can cover the conversation for the daily mentoring and then move to check-in session.

15:23 - Chinmay Pandya 
Will every, does every day, like each daily session, how many points would be same for every day for the agents to cover and how many would be different? If you can provide an insight on that. I don't know what you mean. I mean, does each daily session look the same?

15:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the structure is broadly the same.

15:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because we have established some to-dos or the tasks to be performed for each day.

16:06 - Chinmay Pandya 
I mean, are there some things which which like there's a system where each day is the same. And then there's a system where something new happens at intervals in terms of tracking items.

16:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
I'm not following.

16:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me just do this and then we can ask specific questions as we go through. How about that?

16:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, sounds good.

16:40 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah.

17:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
Thank you so much.

18:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
you.

20:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's getting warm. Gosh.

20:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So let me, are you still there?

20:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep. Okay.

20:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, um, So I would imagine the user waking up, looking at their phone, there'd be the quote of the day, which basically is aligned to the theme or the intention of the day, right?

21:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then there's like, we'll agree there'll be some type message when we know that there's, you know, so basically, This would basically be displayed on user reading the quote. So good morning, Carl. Welcome to day 10. Today, we're going to focus on the killer skill of forming new habits. Now, the day number and what they're focusing on comes from the LMS.

21:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay. Does that make sense? Yep.

22:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then there'd be like, there's some, you're the morning, the morning video where again, that comes from the LMS.

22:20 - Chinmay Pandya 
Got it.

22:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Like that's an example of an optional video that might not be there every morning. And they can watch it here.

22:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
And they can watch that in the app. They don't need to go anywhere. That content has been served to them in the chat interface.

22:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it. Makes sense?

22:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then once that's finished, so actually, what I might do is, is there a way? Yeah, like that. Why isn't that?

23:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I'm going to make that red because I don't know when we just. So imagine then I've watched the video. I'm now going about my day. The next thing we want to know is because you slept last night. The first thing I would want to ask you or you're able to tell me is how was your sleep last night? That's a red arrow just to say I don't know when that displays yet. We'll figure that out. And the idea is that, how was your sleep last night? And rather than waiting for them to type it in, we'll give them these two input buttons so they can just type in the time and the wait time.

23:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
Pre-populated with previous value.

23:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then that basically, so.

24:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
What do you mean by pre-populated with previous value?

24:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I make up that most people's bedtimes and sleep times are going to be very similar. So if I'm going to bed at nine o'clock every night, bedtime should say nine and I'm just confirming what it was.

24:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

24:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it's the previous night's value.

24:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Right.

24:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Same here, did you wake at all during the night? Yes, no. If it's yes, then how many times?

24:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now the question is, if they haven't done these things and we want to show the video, I don't know the UX of that yet. I think that's something we're going to have to play with and figure out what's the best way of showing the user. Because otherwise, there's a very small window of what we can show a user, right?

25:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

25:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I don't want necessarily to say you have to have done the sleep before you watch the video. That's not true.

25:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
So the video can be shown before any activity has been updated.

25:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Potentially, yeah.

25:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's not hard. It's not like a this, then that. And that's why I haven't put arrows in here, because it's not a sequential flow.

25:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then at some point during the day, we say, when you've done your walk, drop in your updates, your distance, your time. Drop in your calories. Drop in your carbs. Now, these might all be like they're there.

26:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
And yeah, I don't know how this works. So that's the, I'm imagining that as we go, every time the user updates or opens the app, there would be either a notification that drives them in or yeah, there might be.

26:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's possible they open the app to notify, I mean, by themselves to update a tracking item.

26:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

26:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
And so that would be, I think, a standard daily flow.

26:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
Now, at the end of the day, I might not have entered any of the data. I might have watched all the videos, but I might not have watched the data. I might not have watched the video. Yeah. Now, the most important thing is, on the day, I'm watching the video and I'm using the content.

27:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So it could be a video, it could be a picture, it could be a PDF. It's like, watch the video, read this, do that.

27:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

27:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
Do the nudges have, like, will the nudges include the text that, here's a video for you?

27:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
Or like, here's a picture for you if you want to watch notifications like that for the user.

27:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
If they haven't even opened the app at all.

27:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we would want to notify them to start driving them into the application 100%.

28:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

28:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then periodically throughout the day, you've got notifications for You've got nudge notifications, you've got reminder notifications.

28:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do reminders could be examples of...

28:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
As an example, let me just do in here. So hi, Carl.

28:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hope you had a great day, a good day. How was your walk today?

29:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
For example, if we haven't had any updates from them, How was...

29:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Last we spoke you were struggling with sugar. How did your eating go today?

29:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
just these are example messages okay and so I suppose if they you might go What did we do? What's that called?

30:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
This will come from the Streaks, right?

30:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

30:46 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, to be clear, are there any minimum criteria for streaks or any activity can be included in a streak?

30:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry, two seconds.

31:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
Um...

31:48 - Chinmay Pandya 
So let's say you have a minimum criteria for a user. The user has to walk 15 minutes a Even if he doesn't walk for 15 minutes and he only walks for let's say 5. Will that be counted in his streak or he has to walk more than 15?

32:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is what I was trying to convey to George. I don't think he was picking it up so I'm really glad you've asked the question. So if I've agreed a target for example of 1200 calories and I'm hitting 1300 calories Oh, that's not bad. 14 to 1500, you need to do better. You're eating 2000. So a streak has two qualities. One is the recording of the activity. And then two is the integrity of the of the of the habit to the goal. So there's like, I ate 1200 calories. I'm absolutely on track. Then there'd be a buffer. So let's say a hundred calories, which we'd still consider it to be good. Then there's slipping, which is maybe a certain percentage over. And then there's, okay, you're doing it, but like everyone eats every day. So on eating, you're going to overeat. I'm walking. Yeah. I walked to the car. It doesn't count. Like you did it. You're recording it, but you're not achieving it. So there is absolutely a quality of the, yeah, to the agreed mile, to the agreed measure of the habit.

33:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

33:27 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think he was pretty clear on this. He said the exact same thing which you said to me, that within a range it can be accepted, but below or above that range, if it's something that has to be achieved above a minimum amount, then I think it won't be accepted if the result is below.

33:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, but whether you lose the streak, this is what I mean.

33:53 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask. I mean, the milestone won't be achieved, but there's a streak for walking every day. But is it just walking every day, or is it walking 15 every day?

34:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I don't have an answer. I think we need to figure out what we think is the right way to do this. Because if one way, I think there has to be a consequence for not doing your thing.

34:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

34:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think there's some tolerance. So if you basically walk 50 minutes a day, yeah, I think we give you the day. If you don't walk at all because of your son was sick, that's different than I didn't walk because I can't be arsed.

34:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

34:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's always those contexts where maybe over the course of the program you get three freebies, you get three misses. After that you start to lose stuff.

34:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I got you.

34:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I think we have to come up with a framework which basically says, for example, Let's see here. So I think if you're here for calories, and the target is 1,200, then we'll have a...

35:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Uh...

36:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just making these things up right now, the exact amounts, but those figures should be in admin, so we can set these variables. Now, the question is, I think here for target, you should be allowed There has to be some form of a trigger event. So we might say, basically, Does that make sense? We're saying, if you're green, you're green. If you're amber, you can do that for five days in a row. And then we would say, you need to be, again, we might say trigger event one, two days in a row, coach to green.

37:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then five days in a row, coach to green.

38:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
Escalate to form going to lose your streak.

38:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Five days in a row, streak lost.

38:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Something like that. Does that make sense?

38:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
So to confirm with you, even if the user performs bad, it will still be added as a streak, but it will be marked as a warning zone. I think if we divide a streak in safe zone, warning zone, danger zone, I'm just making labels up. So it will be added to a warning zone. And if the warning zone is greater than 5, then the streak will be back to 0. Or if the danger zone is greater than 1, then the streak will be back to 0. Am I correct?

39:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think so.

39:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Something like this. Got it.

39:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
So we're clear. I think I'm clear on the streaks because I was working with PR on how to implement this. And then we had a chat that the first thought that came to my mind that if something is below not expected, it shouldn't be added as a streak. That is why I asked this question.

39:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I think we can have the same framework here that if we can put this in admin, then we can set what the threshold for amber and red is and then what's the threshold for days. So you've got a matrix of off-target and then number of days and then that triggers the event. Got it.

39:46 - Chinmay Pandya 
Can you add a note here highlighting that this needs to be added in the ad?

40:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect, thanks.

40:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that would apply to sort of both of them. And so, you know, the original theory when we were looking at this was that this was a combination of a website. It wasn't just a mobile app. So with a mobile app, the chances of you, like, so there's a couple of scenarios. You've had a load of notifications, and you haven't gone into the application.

40:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
You've received a notification.

40:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
You've gone into the application. You've seen the invitation to track your walking, whatever. You either, you've either filled it in or you haven't filled it in. So I'm sort of wondering whether the end of day check-in makes sense anymore, because that's when there was going to be a website that you went to to fill it in.

41:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

41:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because if you, if you haven't at the end of the day, you basically get a reminder notification. So these could be like, End of day, which is basically saying, fill in your stuff.

41:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
What did I have in Mural?

41:52 - Chinmay Pandya 
Do you want to add a feature which would automatically disable any more updates for the day? Let's say after 10 p.m. You should be done by our updates. Now is the time for checking.

42:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
Don't think so.

42:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Interesting.

42:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I was really busy yesterday. I did everything.

42:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
I wake up in the morning.

42:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
And I want to put in yesterday's data.

42:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

42:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
I don't think that's happening right now. No, but we have to be able to support that.

42:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

44:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

45:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's, yeah, I want to do something for yesterday. Okay.

45:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
And that's a normal day flow. I wonder if these are, I don't know what the best UX is.

45:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, there has to be a limit in this new feature. I mean, we cannot allow a user to fill in data for more than one day.

45:41 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because that seems like a very personalized and very good UX, but it increases complexity by so much.

45:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is yesterday OK, but not beyond that?

45:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
Even yesterday, beyond that, I'm for sure it will increase complexity. Yesterday, I cannot say for sure, because it's hit and try. Because right now what happens is, as soon as you open the app, your session is being created. So any time you open the app in the same day, you always update to the same session.

46:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
So alternatively, what we can do, you just say, pop over to your profile, and you can make the updates. Yeah, yeah. Click this link.

46:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
I will take you.

46:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll just do this.

46:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Shall I take you? So I get rid of all of this.

47:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
So then would it happen manually?

47:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
No, it would just redirect.

47:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
It would update the app and just redirect the page. It would load the new page.

47:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it should still happen via chat?

47:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, it's in the chat, but now I'm on the profile page. I'm not on the chat page anymore.

47:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, OK.

47:26 - Chinmay Pandya 
I thought it would redirect to a page where you have a form, and you can just fill it in. Yeah, but not on the profile.

47:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, OK.

47:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
Where you have all of your the program content the previous days all that stuff okay I need to confirm this with George as well because this was not part of the current scope and it's George around I think I think he's out for dinner. Maybe.

48:12 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

48:20 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, the note which you have added in the notifications about the badge. If a milestone is achieved right now, then and there, if you update about something, and I see that you have a streak, you will be rewarded that milestone in the chat. So if you want, I want to be clear on this. If you want milestone notifications only on chat or only on notifications or on both, Because if he's already awarded that badge in the chat, it doesn't make sense to award that again in the notifications.

49:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so for me, if I'm not in the app and I haven't been served the badge, then I should get that through a notification.

49:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, makes sense.

49:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then the notification is driving me into the chat, and then it would have more information. Well done, Carl. You've done this, blah, blah, blah. Now, the question is, where do I see all of this outside of the chat? There needs to be the LMS pages where I can go through all the previous, what I've done, my reports of my health and that sort of stuff. But that's the whole LMS page.

49:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, got it.

49:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
So if they haven't opened the app, it would happen through notifications. But if they have done, they will be rewarded the batch the same moment they enter or update about an activity.

50:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
So about the end of the day check-in session, let's say you've had a busy day.

50:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm just turning on the fan.

50:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's a bit hot in here. Yeah, no worries.

50:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

50:28 - Chinmay Pandya 
Let's say you have a busy day, but you want to update all of your activities when you get back home or when you open the app later in the day. So there's still an option where you can enter all your activities at once or one by one. It depends on the user. And then the user can move to the check-in session.

50:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, this is where I need some help with you guys in terms of how the UX is going to be. Because if you think about it, so Um, uh, I've come in. I've seen that message. That message is now gone. This, this message here is how was your sleep? If I just watched the video and I stopped, is that the message that I've seen? Is that the first message? Cause like, Maybe the notification is just driving me into this message and saying, hey, thanks for coming back. Thanks for coming back in. Let's track your sleep.

51:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
See here, so all of these messages here could actually, where is it?

51:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just trying to get this figured out.

52:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I should know, that would basically say, so end of day. So the end of day notification, it was, how was your walk? So if I had the sleep, so if you think about it, what are the things that I want?

52:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there is bed time, wake time, wake count, We have walk time, walk distance, And carbs and calories, right? So there are all the metrics that we want to track.

53:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if I've done some of them, like if I've watched the video and I put in the bedtime and the wait time and the weight count, then this message would be appropriate, because I'm coming in at this point here.

54:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
If I've done all of them, but this one, then that would be the message. If I've done all of them, it's here.

54:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because whether I filled in all of these, so let's say I've done all of those are, does that make sense? If these are all filled in, this one isn't, then I'd see this. If these two are filled in, then I'd be seeing this. If they're all filled in, then I'd be seeing that message.

54:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, makes sense.

54:38 - Chinmay Pandya 
Let me just check.

54:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
How about you have a general message for user to prompt like Let me think of an example. Hey, let's make sure that we get your tracking items. You haven't updated yet. Just a general message, not referring to any particular activity.

55:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, I think it should always be relative, like say, hey, thanks for your sleep earlier on. How did your eating go? The notification has to be sensible. But I think what's important is This sort of end of day notification isn't such a formal thing anymore.

55:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm going to take her through this and see what she thinks differently.

55:48 - Chinmay Pandya 
I think there are some edge cases where the user doesn't update about some of the activities. And there's an edge case where user doesn't even open the app. But there's always the case that user has updated most of the activities. A few are remaining. And we can start with the check-in session.

56:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hold on a second.

56:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
So here, so we're on the toilet forming habits. Actually, let me put that back in.

56:31 - Cuan Mulligan 
Here, then I would say here.

57:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

57:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
027.

57:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Something like this. So, Jemai, Sonia's just popped in, so I'm just going to give her a catch up on what we're doing just to see if she's any thoughts on it, OK? Yeah.

57:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

57:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hi.

57:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
So what we're trying to figure out is the entire conversation of the day. And beforehand where we had bits on the website, bits on the phone, chat, this is now predominantly a chat interface. So imagine you've opened up WhatsApp or Telegram and you're having a conversation with me or Chinmay, whatever. So you wake up at the top of the page there'll be a pinned theme message quote which is basically the theme of the day which is from our point of view is around I'm making it up it's day 10 and Aristotle, we are, but we repeatedly do accidents, then it's not an act, but a habit, something like that. And then you get a message, morning call, welcome to day 10. And that could also be a notification.

58:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
So if you're not in the app, we want to drive you into the app. So that's the morning notification. And then I'm saying, I forgot to enter my data yesterday. Can I do that now? You pop over to your profile, and you'd have to fill it in, not through the chat. So chat is only today. Profile is anything else. And then there is, like, Simon's got a quick message for you to get your day off to a great start. Watch it here.

59:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is an optional video, and it comes from the LMS. And then I'm saying, hey, Carl, you're smashing it. On your walk today, you will have walked over half a marathon. Nice job. Good luck today.

59:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

59:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
And you might have things like...

59:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Do we want to talk about the weather? I'm giving you an example, yeah. Just people can be all over the world.

59:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's going to be contextual to where they are.

59:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK.

1:00:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this ad hoc message here, Chinmay, is basically, we now know that this person, if they do their walk, is going to achieve a milestone.

1:00:09 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

1:00:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
This would be an upcoming milestone match notification. So that could be for, you know, You're going to lose your pound of sugar. It could be you're going to achieve a milestone, both streaks and achievements.

1:00:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
Then after that, we now need to track your data. So how was your sleep? And then these are input buttons, bedtime, wait time. Did you wake at all? Yes, no, how many times? And sleep for me is the first one, because you'll have already done that. That's what you did last night.

1:00:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
And you want to capture that before you forget it. Yeah.

1:00:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
But we don't know. Again, that's going to have to be a notification.

1:01:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Actually, that's another thing we need to have.

1:01:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
Where did I have that?

1:01:09 - Cuan Mulligan 
Oh, here it is.

1:01:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:01:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
So they may or may not fill this in. So they would have had a notification on their phone. They may ignore it. They may not go to it. But if they do that, then there's another notification which is saying, hey, here's your bottom line video. You need to watch that.

1:01:51 - Cuan Mulligan 
at a, or a PDF, whatever, when you've done your walk, drop in your updates, when you've done your calories or your carbs. And the idea is towards the end of the day, if they've done this, this, actually, let me, can I do this?

1:02:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
So they've done that, they've done that, they've done that, they've done that. Then wait time would mean you would get this message. Hey, Carl, hope you had a good day. How was your walk today? Because you're prompting them to put in the walk. Because they've done all the others. They haven't done walk. Or for example, they've done walk time and distance, but they didn't do carbs. Hey, hope you had a good day. Last you spoke, you were struggling with sugar. How did your eating go today? Or he did everything, Carl. You've been smashing it. You've recorded all your habits for 10 days in a row. Awesome job. You've unlocked the calorie commander badge, as an example.

1:02:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
If I go back to the mural, so this is all capture. We talked about if someone's on a streak, and then there is the, this is the, End of day wrap-up.

1:03:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Right.

1:03:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, So that's the end of day.

1:03:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then I think there is a, this is the analyst bot, which is basically somebody is a regular, regular behaviors.

1:04:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
And you say, right. So I'm just going to move this down.

1:04:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:05:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
These are just examples of irregular messages. So this is the other thing I posted in here. So if their target for calories, for example, is 1,200, it's actually like that.

1:05:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
So their calories is 1,200. It's green if it's within 5%, target 5%.

1:05:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
10% it's amber. If it's more, again, 5-10, we don't know what the numbers are. And then if they do it for two days, if they do it two days in a row, we want to coach them to green. If they're doing it four days in a row, you're going to lose your streak. And the fifth day they'd lose it. They'd lose their streak as an amber. On red, one day of red, you coach to green, you're about to lose your streak. And the second day they've lost their streak. And that would be the same for calories or carbs. You can't do that for sleep. Yeah. But for the formation of the calories. Would you do that for walk? Yeah. It's walking and eating. Yeah. OK. Walk and eat are the two. Yeah. So actually, let me do that now for just so that we have it here. So we have that for calories. And we have walking, which is one hour a day. We can't commit to distance. We're doing one hour a day.

1:06:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
you know, 50 minutes plus is great.

1:06:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
They do 40 minutes plus is amber and then anything under 40 maybe 30 something like that.

1:07:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we have those two there.

1:07:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we have irregular behaviors. So that's the analyst bot, which is looking at everything and saying, okay, we now have your data. If they're irregular, we're doing this. And then we have disengaged behaviors.

1:07:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
Shemai, are you following all of this still?

1:07:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
And this will be a notification like... No, this is a chat.

1:07:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
It could be a notification.

1:07:48 - Chinmay Pandya 
So this is the check-in session, right?

1:07:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Most likely, yes.

1:08:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it is, if I got it right, the check-in session is all about the user patterns and how regular he is.

1:08:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Got it.

1:08:26 - Chinmay Pandya 
So how does this sound? The moment the check-in session starts, this like today's overall performance will be evaluated and added to the streaks in categories of course if it's good then green if it's not then amber and if it's bad then in red and then a report kind of will be generated which will again divide the conclusion in three parts either regular or trying their best almost there and the third one is irregular I think so.

1:09:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're going to have a coaching session, it's probably an hour, isn't it? You're running another workshop with somebody. An hour's a long time, because these things aren't...

1:09:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
minutes, let's say.

1:09:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:09:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Trying to find an hour of someone's free time, you don't want to do it in two weeks' time when they're free. No. You're better off getting in 20, 30 minutes, like today, tomorrow. Because it's not deep stuff, like what I do now, and I get through loads of stuff.

1:09:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
And this will be very specific, like while you record and what's going on, it's about getting them back on track.

1:10:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
And is that happening on the chat as well? Yeah. OK.

1:10:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
This is the agent coach, not the human coach. Yeah, I know.

1:11:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, something like that. So this here, so you've got your morning start. We provide content. We have ad hoc data capture. At the end of the day, we're checking in. So this really is the end of day check in from here.

1:12:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
If they're a regular, you'd have this session. If they're disengaged, you'd have this session.

1:12:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then eventually you end up what your end of day is.

1:12:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
What happens if they're regular?

1:12:35 - Cuan Mulligan 
If they're regular, they will have entered something in and you would just go down to here.

1:12:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well done, you've recorded everything. Yeah, well, actually, where is the...

1:12:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
What you'd have to have here, which is... They'd have some level of their milestone achievement message, because we now have all of their data.

1:13:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then you have your wrap-up daily message.

1:13:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, got it. So I think there's an ambiguity in my understanding here because I thought that irregularity or disengaged would be decided on their performance. So if irregularity or disengages depending on the tracking items updated?

1:13:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because they can still be irregular even if they have all the tracking items updated.

1:13:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so that's what we're now saying that to be irregular is more... Sorry, I don't know where it is here. Irregular is amber and red is... Disengaged, but over time. So this is for one particular metric. But the analyst needs to decide whether somebody is interacting with this regularly, irregularly, or they're disengaged. And we need to agree what that means. So if they are green on their tracking of the data, and they're good data, then they're regular.

1:14:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's tracking and good data, because it could be tracking and bad data. Yeah.

1:14:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's what Amber. Yeah. If they are not tracking.

1:14:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
So there's well, there's two.

1:14:47 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, irregularity is more engaging with the platform. You're not watching the videos. You're not filling it in. Yes.

1:14:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Right.

1:14:55 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's red.

1:14:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're not engaging with the program. You've paid for this. You're not engaging it. That's a red. That's disengaged. We want to speak to you and understand why. We want you to get the best out of the program. If they're sometimes doing it, sometimes not doing it, we need to figure out what that threshold is. If they miss the day, but if they're missing one day a week.

1:15:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
If it's on the third day, then that will be red. They'll become disengaged.

1:15:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Depends, but these are individual metrics. This is like, how are they engaging with ADAPT? If they're not doing the program, They're not doing the habits. If they're recording the data, but the data is shit, that's also a problem. If they're doing the activity, but they're not recording it, that's also a problem. So I'm calling it engagement. So that irregularity or disengaged is an engagement metric. Does that make sense?

1:15:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

1:15:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
So there's a performance metric and also an engagement metric.

1:16:06 - Cuan Mulligan 
I wonder whether engagement is just a combination of all of the things like, do they read the content or they use in the app? We need to have agree. What are the, what, what does it mean to be engaged? And either somebody is regularly, I think regularly engaged is they're filling in all the data. They're watching all the videos. You know, that's easy. Disengaged is also very easy. They're not watching the videos. They're not entering data, or they're entering data, and it's just really bad data. The bit in the middle, that's the how long's the piece of string. We need to figure out what's the right threshold to say somebody is irregular and needs help.

1:16:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:16:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, so you mean that there are three categories right now in the check-in, regular, irregular, disengaged? All activities updated, but bad data is still disengaged?

1:17:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Or no data is disengaged?

1:17:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, OK, let me create something here.

1:17:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
So we have regular, irregular, and disengaged. I always think with these things, Shamay, it's really better to do visuals than just talking about them in words. I think it makes it a lot easier. So what do we have? So we have consumes content.

1:18:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Updates, dragging items.

1:18:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
Enters good data.

1:18:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just enters data.

1:18:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:18:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, to be regular, you consume data and you enter good data.

1:18:25 - Cuan Mulligan 
And you're disengaged if you don't consume the content.

1:18:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
If you're not consuming the content, you don't enter good data.

1:18:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
So you've got does not enter data. We've done it with that. If you don't enter data, you either have that.

1:18:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
You either have this.

1:18:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
You're entering good data.

1:19:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
You're doing it sometimes.

1:19:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is what disengaged is.

1:19:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
and irregular is sometimes consuming data, sometimes entering, sometimes like that's the irregularity is somewhere in between.

1:19:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Make sense?

1:19:47 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, although still confused on the criteria for irregularity. Because if sometimes is also included in disengaged, then I think we'll have ambiguity over irregularity and disengagement.

1:20:05 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, so irregular might be, shall we say, They've missed three days of content, or three days missed. So if either one of those is true, they become a regular, and that would cause the coaching session.

1:20:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
If they don't consume the content for five days, or they don't enter data for five days. Yeah, so that's five days and that's three days, something like that.

1:20:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay, so for the user to be irregular, they have to miss three days of good data.

1:21:09 - Chinmay Pandya 
Not just three days of data, because that will go to disengaged.

1:21:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, no, five days would be disengaged.

1:21:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:21:19 - Chinmay Pandya 
So even if they do not enter anything for three days, they're still irregular.

1:21:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
I think that's it there.

1:21:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

1:21:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
So it depends on how many days they missed, the difference between irregular and disengaged. I think so, yeah.

1:21:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

1:21:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
Got it.

1:21:48 - Cuan Mulligan 
Does that make sense so far?

1:21:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

1:21:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm wondering whether we pause there because I think to do another topic right now might flood the brain.

1:22:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I agree. I think we've covered a lot of topics. We've covered some notifications. The possibility of a new feature for entering previous day's check-ins or tracking items. We have covered the streaks. We have covered the check-in session. I think you'll also give more feedback on this with irregularity and disengaged and more feedback on the UX regarding the notifications and the daily flow.

1:22:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool. Yeah.

1:22:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, let me know if you have any questions. I'm sure that's going to digest. And you've got questions as they come up. Let me know.

1:22:45 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I mean, I've asked most of the questions while you were making the diagram. So I'm pretty clear. Up till here, I'm pretty clear.

1:22:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sounds good, man. Thanks. Thanks, Kevin.

1:22:59 - Chinmay Pandya 
It was very insightful. Cheers, buddy. Talk to you soon.

1:23:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Talk to you soon.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (7).txt"

0:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see. Place.

0:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah. They have the most per capita, right? But Texas probably has the most. I don't know. Or China. Wait, no. China is in the state. But yeah. Never mind.

0:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Between.

0:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you say China is a continent?

0:21 - Jorge Lewis 
They're right. Actually, their economy is starting to, they have deflation right now.

0:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow. Didn't Japan have like mandatory deflation for like a while?

0:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, Japan had a big... I think it's still a big issue. Their population is decreasing. Like, how does that happen? That's just...

0:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, do you want the explanation? Because I haven't...

0:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I know the explanation, but it's just like... Do they just watch? Do they make plans for 10 years and then just watch it and don't change?

0:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like, all the politicians, because it's an age of population, all the old people are voting for the people that give old people benefits, and the young people are getting fucked, so they can't get, like, they aren't in a financial

1:14 - Jorge Lewis 
position to get children. But I mean, like, do they not see that? Like, we're talking about, like, probably at least 100 people plus working on this, on, like, these things.

1:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, they aren't getting the votes.

1:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Interesting. New York City is the highest with the Bay Area, Tokyo, Singapore, London, Los Angeles. Millionaires total.

1:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Wow.

1:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:46 - Jorge Lewis 
How's Texas not here? I don't know. My mom was like, Oh, Texas is the most millionaires.

1:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I finally got the motorbike and it's the exact motorbike I've been looking at getting for like two weeks now. So that's nice.

2:05 - Jorge Lewis 
We haven't checked up on the wise has been sent, but I don't know if you've, I don't know what that is looking like,

2:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's arriving tomorrow, right?

2:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Tuesday.

2:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, okay. Tuesday.

2:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, yeah, just, uh, it's fine for now. They're the latest internationally.

2:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Three Texas cities have the most millionaire billionaires among the U.S.

2:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
cities. On the way back, I had to follow the car which the other guy was driving, and going 90 down the freeway on my first drive was not what I had planned. But the thing is, my phone was in his car, so I didn't have my phone. So I just had to book it after him. Because otherwise, I had no shot of getting home.

3:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I'd have to somehow find a corner and ask for help. Was it between Central Festival and Maja, or...?

3:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
It was going from, like, slightly into Old Town to southeast, like way southeast. Oh, okay. Across the bridge and through a bunch of turns and everything. And on the highway, as noted by the 90K. Yeah.

3:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
That was up in the highest gear and all the way pulled back.

3:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Does it have a gearbox, at least?

3:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh yeah, it's a manual. Or, well, it's semi-auto, so no clutch, but gearing and everything.

3:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Those ones without gearboxes just...

3:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, no, it doesn't have a gearbox. I'm just... That's shifting.

3:51 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, how do the... No, but like...

3:54 - Jorge Lewis 
How do they make a stone comfortable? Like, surely... The bolt drivers, you mean?

3:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
They're just shit. Like, they're actual garbage. Like, when I went to the course, they didn't have enough automatics. And I was the last guy in queue, so they just gave me a semi-auto. And I was like, yeah, I wanted to learn this anyway.

4:14 - Jorge Lewis 
When you're driving, you don't feel the... Like, when I was driving the car, when I was learning how to drive the car, like, if I'd make a sharp turn, you don't feel it when you're driving. Because you've got your hands, like, on the wheel and it's just like, you're in the way of the turn. But, like, when you're in the back seat, everyone's like...

4:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but the gear shifting, like, the first was like... Especially when I shifted down, I didn't... It had no gearbox, so the RPM just got translated over and it just... Yeah. It didn't go faster, it just kicked at the same speed. And then I slowly but surely learned how to switch gears with it being better.

5:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
You're muted, I think.

5:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you talking to the others?

5:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello?

5:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
No audio. Can you hear me?

5:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello, hello?

5:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hello, hello? Yeah, now I can hear you. You just cut out, and then I saw you just...

5:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
I was trying to...

5:52 - Jorge Lewis 
For the Ferraris and the Lamborghinis, the gearshifts, they just press a button and it just looks cool.

6:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've gotten pretty good at getting the smoothest of gearshifts now though. It's interesting.

6:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Especially shifting down in here. I have to do the perfect braking before shifting.

6:18 - Jorge Lewis 
it just reminds me of like like it just I don't know it's just so fun for me like all that stuff like doing like lamborghini uh stops and just like or not limousines um breaks and stuff like that or stops or whatever yeah um yeah one thing before we go into the topic is So for some, so like we have the mindset of the longterm with some of these guys, like investing into them, but like, since we're so inexperienced with hiring people and kind of their culture in general, and we didn't go to the university ourselves. So it's like pretty, and we just, we're too young as well. We haven't met enough people their age to kind of understand. Okay, do they have the potential? Like for Chinmay, for example, I can see he has good potential. But for someone like Cas9, like for example, the Primogen, what's his real name? I never said it, never.

7:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
But it's out there.

7:37 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyways, that guy, like no one probably thought he was going to be like, oh, the greatest of greats.

7:45 - Jorge Lewis 
so it's like for okay so for the one I'm speaking about is like someone like b was in house nine for them like how does english get better sorry michael it is michael it is michael yeah he has mentioned it michael or at least someone has mentioned it michael yeah and it's for someone like has nine his english is it needs a lot of work um Like, it's just not something that we can take to clients. Um, like it's, it's conversational, but I feel like we should be, we need people that are fluent, like Chinmay and, and I don't know if Biwas is fluent actually, Will's fluent. Um, but anyways, like there's, there's, it's not, so the language is one thing that of course can be learned. Um, but there's also, Like Nazif, he's become as good as he is in English because he spends time improving it. Hassan doesn't really, he just does things on the internet that are inherently English. But there's some behaviors that, like for example, Chinmay and Nazif, I just know I can work with them because they aren't going to tell me, oh, that's a good idea. Like every single time, like they, they participate in conversations. I had a conversation with, with the whole team on, um, on Adapt and it was just me and Chinmay talking like the whole time. Um, like I like Has9. Um, like, of course we get along well, but it just, I feel like there's going to be maybe, like, I just can't see. If there's potential or not. I'm not saying I can't see potential, I'm saying I can't see if there is.

9:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
And also, just from a fundamental standpoint, if we're at the stage in our business where we should be investing in people that we're unsure about for the long term.

9:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and it's like, when you, like, I think there's so many people out there that it's like, if you hire another person, like, or I think The objective way to go about it is you should fire him and look for another one, another one out of college or like another young person.

10:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

10:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
At the motorbike course, I actually met a software engineer. He's in his like 40s now and he's like started two companies. He had like a lot of insight there. And basically he just said, like when he interviews, like he usually rejects like at least five people before he finds one that he deems like fit. If that makes sense.

10:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like that's the minimum.

10:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we did quite a few. We did one-way interviews.

10:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I mean, sorry to elaborate on that, that's bringing them on the team for like, basically like we did, but we accepted every single person. We brought on the team but he just like throws them off the second he sees like okay this isn't it just oh it's not what yeah like for example be worse he's got a great worth ethic and yeah maybe

11:15 - Jorge Lewis 
like because like think about it like this as well when I first started programming I put try statements everywhere I had no clue what I was like, When you first started, you just like, there's different types of people. There's people that start with like good, you know, foundations like Nazif and perhaps yourself. But for someone like me, where I just, I was just like, I'm just the type to just try everything and just like, just the grind. And then you, and then you get to a point where you're, you've learned things.

11:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
So, I think he is similar to that, because some of the things he figured out with NixOS and the old tech stack, I did not. I straight up tried it for half an hour, just gave it to him, and then he figured it out. He may have taken more time than I would, but he figured it out. He found weird-ass solutions.

12:13 - Jorge Lewis 
I just can't remember back when I first started. I told him to evaluate I'm getting a weird echo or something.

12:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

12:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So I was speaking one, two, three.

12:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, not for me.

12:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so I told him to evaluate the leads or to improve the, the, the rest system. And I told him when you're comparing the results of a, of an analyzer compared to the actual system, he was using an LLM to compare their yes or no, their Boolean value. And I was like, oh, bro, there's no reason, like you've over-engineered it, there's no reason to use LLMs. And he said, hmm, okay, yeah. But then he came to me again and he brought up the same point, but as he was saying it, he realized that I already suggested for him. So I'm trying to figure out, would I make that same mistake in trying to, over-engineer, perhaps, because when you're naive and inexperienced, you just kind of think, oh, the most fanciest solutions. Perhaps it could go over my head that, oh, there's just a property that we compare Boolean. We think of it as common sense now, but maybe that's just in hindsight. I don't know. So it's tough to say, but at the same time, it's like, we're putting money into him in the hopes that he gets better in the long term.

13:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. And also like when they get better, when we like form them into what we need, they may just up and out.

13:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. I mean, as long as there's more potential at Futino than other companies, I think they'll stay, which I think we'd be able to provide with how ambitious we are.

14:10 - Jorge Lewis 
One attribute of Chinmay that is just very clear is that he has goals. I think you were listening in on the part where he knows he wants to improve in terms of salary and everything.

14:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
He wants an American California salary.

14:31 - Jorge Lewis 
I want to tell him in a nice way, unless you go there, you're not going to make that.

14:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Well, that's why he was looking into starting a business, right?

14:42 - Jorge Lewis 
But in, I don't know if he wanted to do it in India or in the US, but they all wanted to start a business by the way.

14:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
You said, well, Chen Mei is the one that's most like looked in. Yeah. And like when he was talking about MBA, I think he wanted to take the MBA for the actual learning, not for the degree.

15:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I got the guy that at the end as well. But I was like, I, we just kind of went into a different topic. But I could hint that, oh, he thinks he needs to learn about business to do business.

15:18 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, one of the things I can maybe has nine doesn't show that kind of that all the things all the nice things that we see in China, because his English is not a good like, if you're, if you're Second language is not that good, you just speak less of it usually.

15:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, I think the reason why he's not good at English, like compared to me, which I also didn't study English like Nasif is doing, is because they speak Hindi, which you can find a tutorial, you can find YouTube videos, you can live on the internet in Hindi. You can't live on the internet in Norwegian. So I was forced to watch everything I watched, entertainment, tutorials, everything in English. They are all watching it. Like I had a discussion with them, both Biwas and Hasnain, they always watch in Hindi. Like if they need a tutorial for something, they always find the Hindi version. I advised Biwas not to, I advised him to watch in English instead to improve his English, but I don't know if he took it to heart.

16:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. You know, you know, I was reading back at my messages and see if, and we were talking once. I remember about like how his, um, the way he works is just kind of different from what we like, But I think that's not true. I think maybe it's just the way he expresses himself is, is how he was. Uh, Nazif Nazif.

16:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, Nazif. Okay.

16:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Like I was looking at our WhatsApp chats and, um, And we were talking about, okay, let's do this. And he was like, oh, excited to be part of this new adventure. It's like a dream coming true for me, and I'm very grateful. So I think for him, working, getting a full-time job for a company, or at least like an aspiring, an ambitious company is kind of part of what he likes. I think he's, I wanna ask him some more questions when he gets back. I don't wanna, of course, interview him, but I wanna figure out, like, What do you prefer more to be a freelancer or to have a team that understands you and you can work with both sides?

17:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
If we were talking about developing, the way we disagreed with his frame of mind was that he wanted to focus on getting just the best at one thing, but we think it's better to explore all the avenues because that makes you better at the one thing. Was there any change of perception from your end there, or is that still the same?

18:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or was it just on the like wanting to be a freelancer compared to wanting to have a full time?

18:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think I think I confused those two. I probably remembered wrong that the main point was that he wanted to focus on one thing. Whereas when you're in a team, it involves working on all other things, I guess.

18:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not even on the team, just like if you're a developer in general, you should learn everything.

18:31 - Jorge Lewis 
An employee, yeah.

18:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not like outside of a job, I'd just be learning new shit every two weeks. I'd be learning Rust, I'd be learning SIG, I'd be learning HTMX, I'd be learning, just jumping from thing to thing because when I jump back again, I'll be so much better than if I just focused on that thing.

18:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually good developers are the ones doing everything. They're not really...

18:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe we could help him open his eyes to that. At some point, we've had our idea or our dreams were like, oh, we're going to be experts at this one thing. Everyone has that. But since we've been forced to try everything else, we've kind of realized, oh, trying everything else helps us become better at that one thing if we wanted to.

19:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm kind of surprised he's like a fan of the Prime Engine. The Prime Engine is a big advocate of just trying stuff.

19:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
He made a Doom game on Twitch.

19:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he's making Doom and... What is it?

19:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
ASCII.

19:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. But like, he's learning OCaml now. I think he finished learning Rust. He's learning Go now. He's just advocating so much for just trying stuff. Someone even asked him, should I try Vim? And he said, it's not about Vim, it's about trying it. Try Emacs.

19:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
You just gotta get experience, try everything. Because if you spend one year on VS Code compared to six months VS Code, three months Emacs, three months Vim, you're and you eventually choose VS Code, you're going to be better on VS Code, because you know the fundamentals, you know how to compare servers, you know where it's a live server.

20:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I didn't actually... I sent a video regarding that Vim. I think it was a video from the Prime Agents saying you use Next for the wrong reasons.

20:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or you use Vim for the wrong reasons. Or don't use Vim for the wrong reasons, yeah.

20:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's you use Vim for the wrong reasons.

20:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I think the problem is different from the title. Maybe.

20:41 - Jorge Lewis 
But it was pretty funny because that day or the, yeah, I think it was that day, me and Will were talking about, or I was telling him, people listen to people like the Primagen and don't realize that they're spending more time configuring their Vim setup than writing solutions. And there's so many reasons why people like, the main thing is just, you have to think for yourself and figure out, okay, Should I be using Vim or should I be using VS Code? And I feel like for most people it's VS Code. For most people.

21:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like if you're in... I'd argue VS Code with Vim bindings though. Vim bindings are just amazing.

21:19 - Jorge Lewis 
No, not Vim bindings. The emulator. Or the... I still haven't gotten it, but... Fabian told me there's like an emulator where it's actually like Vim in VS Code, which gives you the best of both worlds.

21:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not just the Vim plugin?

21:39 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's like, it's, I don't know. I think it was something else. I can't remember.

21:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you guys still get like the call on the command line and everything.

21:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I've heard of it, but that sounds difficult.

21:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. The main, my main point was with, with Will was just like, yeah, it's, you can't, why use Linux if like you have to really just think what benefits do you get from it other than looking cool when someone else sees your screen? Cause. Damn, I felt cool when I was in the airport with my Linux, NixOS and my Vim. When I'd be in the co-working space and other people can see my Vim and I'm like, yeah, new Vim by the way.

22:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like for me, I think like the time I've spent with Wynn now, if I moved over to VS Code, I'd be much better at working with VS Code or whatever, Editor, Emacs, like at setting it up to how I like it, knowing what, how it should work to work most efficiently with it, all of that. I feel like it's almost more true the opposite, where I think Will, he literally just copied Primogen's config and used his Vim because Primogen said Vim is good. But Vim is all about being a personal development environment where you decide exactly how it's most efficient to you.

23:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Will seemed to have a good understanding that Linux is only for certain people. He showed that he had good understanding of that, but there's one point we disagreed on, which I can't remember exactly what.

23:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyways, before we go into the night, let's just kind of dive into the topic, and then we can see where it goes afterwards, just so we can finish that up at least. So yeah, as I said in the Discord message, So ideally, next time or on the third time, we can set up a podcast. So we both set up our cameras or our phone cameras, whatever you want to use, and treat it like a podcast. We can livestream that. And then we post-process it. We can add in some voiceovers, animations, and all that to make it into a concise video.

24:04 - Jorge Lewis 
But right now, so I've made a day in the life video. Um, it was just ad hoc. It was like, it was midday and I was like, all right, let's just record. And I just kind of recorded the whole day. Um, and I've learned so much and I'm just, that's why I've decided, let's not start with a podcast. Start with this. We'll pretend it's a podcast. Um, or at least, I mean, it's like most podcasts are uploaded, not live stream.

24:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
So that's the podcast. I'm not live podcast. Live podcasts are very new thing.

24:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. But then the, I guess the most, the most of the setup is regarding your, your, your equipment, like your cameras and stuff, but also being in the frame of mind to be able to speak properly. Like if you write that. So right now when I, what I learned is I'm terrible at speaking into a camera. I thought I was good. I thought I was like, Oh, I'm a good speaker. But you put yourself in front of a camera and know that people are going to be watching. You're like, uh, and in your head, you don't sound that bad, but you watch it back and you realize every two words is a filler word. And you're like, wow.

25:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

25:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Also. Yeah. I mean, I guess when you're in a podcast, you don't have to look at the camera, but I've realized like just regarding my YouTube channel. Um, I don't have like in this one video that I made the day in the life, I don't have time to edit that. It took me way too long to edit. I recorded it Monday, by the way. I'm going to publish it this Monday. It took me a week to get done with all my other stuff. That's just not the schedule I want. I don't like the stress that it has, but I really enjoy the filmmaking and the cinematic and that part. So what I think I might do is at the start right now, since all I want to do right now is just document, I'll make the similar style videos as I just sent you from Joe. What's his name?

26:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Joe, Joe. Wow. Oh, wow. How, how, wow? D-Woz is at your table, by the way. Oh, bruh. What's he saying? I just heard clicking half the time from my microphone went together and so D-Woz, he also waved at me.

26:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
What would you say?

26:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'd make videos like Joao, where it's just like you maybe write a script for like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and then you speak off of that. And it's just very minimal, mostly stories, so that when you're speaking, you don't have to do research. And it's just from your experience. It's not opinions. It's just experience. And, um, that way the quality to make, or the effort to make those videos is really low, but you can dish out, you can build a fan base. And later I would, as when I could be able to afford it, I'd hire an editor to edit my videos, but make my own cinematic or kind of, I guess, cinematic films. Cause I want to, I want to have like, like, for example, who I am is, is a video that I would spend probably a couple of months on just as like a passion, just like the, He's trying to join

27:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
from his personal account.

27:39 - Jorge Lewis 
But like right now, I just don't have the time to work on it. And I've been at least told probably five times this one week to focus on one thing.

27:53 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you need?

27:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Just checking in.

27:59 - Jorge Lewis 
We're doing a... It's good to see you. Well, good to hear you. No, I haven't seen you for like a month at this point.

28:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Since, I think, last Thursday.

28:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Way before that.

28:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Since Nexus OS got installed on this computer. I think it's Linux in general because like the research like we did or when troubleshooting it we googled the laptop model and it seems to just be struggling every distro.

28:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Some wine.

28:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Some wine?

28:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

28:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can I make a cocktail?

28:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Are Just some classic one. Enjoying it with my beautiful classical musician over there. You can hear that?

29:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I can't, but I've had a keyboard like that. I know the sound it makes.

29:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Is my mic fixed by the way?

29:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I went to the- No, we can't hear you.

29:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Bye, I got a motorbike now.

29:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Finally. The Honda Wave 125i.

29:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
You know what?

29:44 - Biwas bhandari 
You're renting or buying it?

29:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Renting, and then I'll probably buy it, but I'm also looking at Facebook's marketplace to see if I'll get a better deal.

29:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, yeah.

29:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Most of them are in Bangkok. The one selling it, it seems like, legit, I'm not joking, probably 20% or like 10% of them are the Honda Wave model, and no one's selling it. Everyone just wants to keep it. It's good.

30:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
The one I've got now has a whopping 480,000 miles on it, or kilometers. What, how much? 480,000?

30:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Bro, it drives like butter still. It's just like the 10,000 one I just tried before, which was double the price.

30:36 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you get 480,000 in 5 miles?

30:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like locals. That's the one that they drive to.

30:46 - Biwas bhandari 
It's like it's running since the sixties. Continuously seven years old.

30:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Oh, yes.

30:58 - Jorge Lewis 
As your, as your clients, I would expect more updates for my rest, my Read.AI tool.

31:04 - Biwas bhandari 
I create everything is done and I created the PR because what do you haven't, I think most did yet.

31:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is that how you speak to a client? You ask him to merge your PR requests?

31:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm still waiting for my manager to merge me.

31:23 - Biwas bhandari 
I pushed it, but my manager haven't merged it, I think. So it depends on him.

31:35 - Jorge Lewis 
I applied to the Thiel Fellowship, by the way.

31:38 - Biwas bhandari 
You applied?

31:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, I usually don't apply. There's a deal with Spencer link to the field fellowship, Peter Thiel, I believe. And I usually don't apply to those grants, because this usually requires like a lot of mentorship, like they want to bring you up and kind of say, Oh, we've raised this guy. But what it looks like on their website, it's just like, we literally just give you money and you like to enable you to go do whatever you want.

32:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Apply or like only you and then you got me and it's less, it's less Oh, your name and your email. Uh, you cut out there for the entire explanation. I just heard your name and their email.

32:23 - Jorge Lewis 
My hair.

32:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. You're back.

32:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Uh, yeah.

32:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Do you know about building space? And they also do the, uh, yeah, they also do the same kind of thing.

32:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. But most, most of the time is those, those things require you to kind of, they, they, they make you do a lot of programs and like mentorship things. And then I just, I'm not interested in that, but it seems like the field fellowship is kind of all about just being, just giving you money to enable you to build a business.

32:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

32:58 - Biwas bhandari 
When I was looking at this, um, I don't know. That techcrows do you know about those guys let me see their channel there one one of the audience said that if you are building a startup or something like that uh they gave you yes same like the fellowship program but it's canadian I think Um, if I find that video once again, I'll send it.

33:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

33:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, Jorge, could I get just from a, like 1% to like a hundred percent confidence level of getting a grant here and how much, just so I have any context because yeah.

33:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Um, there's an off of the top of your head number. Doesn't have to be accurate. Like seven.

34:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Because they're, what is it? How did you find it?

34:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Uh, yeah, I mean, my friend sent it to me.

34:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So they don't have any marketing. It's just word of mouth. And like the people that are getting, that are trying to apply or people like us and his friends. So I think my resume is.

34:28 - Jorge Lewis 
there's maybe it shows it depends of course what type to invest in whether it's people that have a year or two experience or whether it's people fresh but people over there fresh usually don't take money very well yeah well like how much and what was it seven percent you said it's a hundred thousand grants over two years when you realize Next year that wouldn't be so much to us.

35:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, yeah, but the current mouse, that would help.

35:12 - Jorge Lewis 
In case you didn't know, we're trying to reach 100k this year, by December. So far we're about 40, 41, I think so far. Um, but we have, we have, that's not considering, uh, uh, promise.

35:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, okay.

35:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Uh, besides Kuwan and JP, I haven't seen other clients. I mean, I was trying to reach other clients out after only completing these two.

35:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, so the biggest or that it was mostly just small clients like the below 1000 Oh, we had one above 1000. That was a Guy with money that doesn't have time. And he doesn't put any time into his website. He just gave us money and told us to make it. And then we made something, delivered it, and has he gotten back to us?

36:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Very interesting.

36:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wait, isn't this month that we're supposed to ask for a retainer?

36:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Next month.

36:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Have you been in contact with them at all?

36:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, here and there. Not recently, but I think the last time I checked was maybe January.

36:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
What's your confidence in getting that retainer?

36:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Pretty high. If you consider that they're the biggest garage company in Hong Kong. How much were they doing a year? I think it was 50 million.

37:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
I wonder if it'll be more like, ah, I'll support the small fry. Or if it'll be like actually valuing the website, because is he still running advertisements for the old one?

37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
That was so weird.

37:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
We made him a whole new modern website, much better than the old one looking. And the week after, we searched up his company and got an advertisement for his old website, not the one we made.

37:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I think my dad found it.

37:40 - Jorge Lewis 
My dad searched up Wonderly and the ad came up for their old website and my dad checked it out and was like, you made this?

37:50 - Biwas bhandari 
And I was like...

37:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me send it to you. Maybe it's still up. Oh no, it's down. It's because we took their domain. But it was like 1990s, like raw HTML.

38:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the old one down?

38:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I mean, there's, cause we took the, we took the wonderland.com domain.

38:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Oh, we better not like the, the, the domain name management of that one, by the way, is seven years has paid off it. We'll get no notification, but before it runs out, we have to transfer it.

38:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Dude, that's a 3d animation. Oh yeah.

38:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh yeah, go to wonderly.com if you want to see some of our work. You can see all the remnants of our past projects. If you look in projects, you can see itino, startino, wonderly, reditor, oneoffs, oneoffscaptures. Can you see the screen?

38:57 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, yeah.

38:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's probably lagging.

39:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I have to refresh to get the fresh animations.

39:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, I remember you made this like, and while you were making it, you were trying to make everything into work with, uh, Lord.

39:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
I hope that didn't traumatize you too much.

39:49 - Biwas bhandari 
I brought back some bad memories.

39:53 - Jorge Lewis 
That was like the most naive thing we could ever think. We were like, dude, let's give us LORC. It stands for Library of Reusable Components.

40:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't need to go any further. We thought we were being like the newest. We thought we were like so innovative.

40:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
We tried to save every component, everything we made into this like component library that we were planning to use internally in every project we had.

40:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
So we tried to write all our code reusable.

40:50 - Jorge Lewis 
At least now I know what it takes to build a reasonable library.

40:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Just an interesting note on that, over like five projects or so, we'd be able to use all of our code and input it to a code generation system.

41:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Like it would be really good at, so I mean, actually what I want to try is, been on my bucket list a while, Shed CN code generation thing.

41:23 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, that's what I said. No, uh, generative UI.

41:31 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, not generative UI. I mean, like, like code, like generative, like it creates the code that makes the UI.

41:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

41:40 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, that, that that's generative UI. That's like in a chat bot, it can create new UI on the spot. I'm talking about like an entire code base. So like backend plus frontend, like everything. Oh, you mean back into, I mean, like the Vercel does it in ShedCN. You know, that's using ShedCN. Yeah.

42:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Also, I think my one recommendation will be, for example, every time we do a project, we need a signup login compulsory. So we just, why don't we just create a template of that?

42:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we've had that on our to-do list for a little bit, a little while.

42:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let's see if I was supposed to create a template quite some time ago.

42:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Because every time we do project, we do not need to spend time on those things.

42:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

42:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Because we've done it already twice for Oak and for Itino. So it is something. So whatever Will is working on right now, those two weeks that he's going to spend on it should realistically be like half a week.

42:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, if you don't mind, it's already past bedtime already and I still have to finish this whole thing with Jonas.

43:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, what a hard thing.

43:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you read in the chat that I added you in, that's kind of why I added you there, so that you would read the text that was there and get some context.

43:15 - Jorge Lewis 
But the study joined.

43:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
I added you because if you read right above, it says, let's pretend it's a podcast so that we can learn. I'll be recording our session. Basically, we were going to be recording the podcast, YouTube video, Ugly Codaskin. Oh.

43:40 - Biwas bhandari 
Will you upload it? Huh? Yeah. Then I'll also go. It's already 11 here.

43:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
11pm. It's 12 here. Jorge, you never answered my question. How sober do I have to be for the podcast?

44:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Undetectable to a stranger.

44:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've had water in this but I can fill it up with something else.

44:18 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm gonna go have a good night guys.

44:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Have a good night. See you tomorrow.

44:23 - Biwas bhandari 
Just the mic is peaking but otherwise it's nice.

44:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have this one. Don't worry. It's out of the allowance. What is that?

44:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I wouldn't care.

44:51 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a valid purchase. What is it? Well, I can't even read that like it's yeah, it's like Samsung.

45:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like the it's rum. Basically, it's just rum. Cheaper whiskey.

45:09 - Jonas Lindberg 
So it's 40%.

45:10 - Jorge Lewis 
You just have that there or any special occasion or just like, I might as well?

45:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like, I mean, just straight up, I like the taste of Coke better with some mixed in. But also like some nights we hang out just in the living room here.

45:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I've found a passion for wine yesterday and I was like, I'm in the mood for some wine. I'm glad this wasn't that expensive. It's not! This was like $13.

45:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, it's $13 too, which...

45:53 - Jorge Lewis 
There goes your weekly allowance for food.

46:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I hate though. It's like you're in Thailand and just everything is great. But then you leave and you're like, you just enter depression. And I think there's a term for it like, like, yeah.

46:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like the motorbike I'm renting is like the nice version of it. It's the one, two, five, five. Okay. It's, it's got but they also had another one, which he said was like 10 years old. And I was like, why does it have kilometers? Oh, that's because it's gone to a million and flipped over.

46:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, it's like, I think for the month I paid $2,500.

46:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Why did you...?

46:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I have no clue what he's saying. Matias, what are you doing? It's 1am.

46:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm doing the dishes.

47:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Matias, what are you doing?

47:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think he may have...

47:18 - Jorge Lewis 
You're just filling cups up and then... Just go sleep. So your brain can develop.

47:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

47:37 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

47:41 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen. So I prepared videos that we can just kind of We can watch.

47:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let me just pour a little bit.

48:07 - Jorge Lewis 
This not being able to open a YouTube tab is really annoying.

48:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me know if you can hear whatever is being recorded, or whatever is being...

48:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, I can't. How about doing it on Discord instead of Google Meet? You have OBS, right?

48:57 - Jorge Lewis 
On this, I do. But does it run?

49:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Thailand's great.

49:24 - Jorge Lewis 
You sounded like you just got there like a week ago.

49:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm saying it as a conclusion, like now I've lived here for quite a while, right? Four months.

49:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I was there for like, like 10 weeks.

49:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Start of April, then left for two weeks, April. Yeah. So.

49:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, hasn't... Oh yeah, you got out at the right time though, to be honest. Like, it's been quite... Every night it rains, so... You can imagine nightlife isn't that good at the moment. Though I'm not going out often.

50:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, here it rains pretty often as well.

50:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I see you have the WetUSDT tab.

50:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, my Chrome.

50:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

50:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is it at 0.025 now, or is that from ages ago?

50:42 - Jorge Lewis 
No clue.

50:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
How's it going? Oh. Oh. Oh, that's the time.

50:59 - Jorge Lewis 
It's hit. I checked my Binance accounts, I'm down a K.

51:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm down like 6 K total I think.

51:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Cheers to that.

51:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

51:15 - Jorge Lewis 
To the moon.

51:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing is though. Is still going strong, and if this is an ABC pattern, like up, down, up, you know, ABC, then it's, if BTC pops up, I think we're getting the C curve of the ABC, and it should be nice.

51:41 - Jorge Lewis 
We're relying on this Christmas season to like, this October, November to kind of pop off. If it doesn't, then RIP.

51:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are we, like, according to my friend, which has been saying this since forever, it's going to be like 2025, which is the year it pops up. He said, like, the bear season was coming a bit, like, before it came now. But he's always said 2025 is going to be the year.

52:15 - Jorge Lewis 
It may be. No.

52:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, you can watch them.

52:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Wasn'T… I'm on my laptop.

52:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I can move to my PC actually.

52:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow, finished already?

52:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Way more than half.

52:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean like the glass.

52:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't, I don't, I don't know why, but I don't like pouring a full glass.

52:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it's a, I like to feel like you want to swirl it.

52:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like, no, just when you finish, because if it's a full glass, you finish and you're like, wow, I finished the full glass. But if it's a half glass, you're like, no, I only finished half.

53:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

53:17 - Jorge Lewis 
This is going to take a while trying to figure out how to put a cork bag. Good night, buddy. That'll do.

53:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I wonder what's going to happen if I go to the US, or if my parents go to the US.

53:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hmm. Yeah. Texas. How expensive is it there?

53:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, expensive.

53:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can you at least like live with your parents and still do the high-ticket networking?

53:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, that's the only option. Like I can't live by myself there probably. I guess at some point, that's not a limitation.

54:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
What about like moving to Chiang Mai?

54:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it would depend. So let me just turn off all the lights. Um, so they're probably going to decide within like two weeks. Um, So if they do end up going, what I think I'm going to do is stay in Asia until Christmas, and then fly over there for Christmas. And then if we do end up bringing the whole team down to Chiang Mai, then I'll fly back down for that.

54:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think most probably I'd join in the house, by the way.

54:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nice.

55:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
How's sales going? How's what?

55:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Sales. Pretty bad. I've been trying to handle loads today.

55:21 - Jorge Lewis 
why it's been the responses haven't been they feel like they haven't been high so I was trying to figure out so one assumption I had was because I was doing comments before as out So even though it makes the account look bad, and potentially all that, it did, I think, get more responses. So I was evaluating that earlier. All right. I am going to connect to my laptop or to my PC. I'm going to use the Russian first.

58:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yo, yo, yo.

58:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yo, let me connect my iPod.

59:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

59:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. All right, nice.

59:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

59:14 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, let me go ahead and share my screen.

59:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, yeah. Can you see my screen?

59:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Uh, yeah, I can.

59:41 - Jorge Lewis 
If you can hear anything.

59:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
No.

59:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bro.

59:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let me see if it's my side Yeah, there's no like the unmute button.

59:55 - Jorge Lewis 
That's great that I think you need to share the browser not the entire screen I'm sharing the browser But I need to share a tab to share the audio yeah, oh wait, I can just I know what to do

1:00:18 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the What's the command or what if you change the URL to?

1:00:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Question mark of user equals one.

1:00:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
Don't work for me.

1:00:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
What's the number? Like if you go to Gmail and change to your personal account, what's the slash you slash number? Change to that number.

1:00:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Just opens in its own.

1:00:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Can I just add a tab without a...

1:00:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just try all the offuser equals something until you get one that's correct. You can't have that many.

1:01:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I just, I don't think it's going to work.

1:01:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

1:01:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are you signed in with your personal account?

1:01:20 - Jorge Lewis 
No, not signed in with this one.

1:01:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but like, uh, go to like Gmail and then add account and add your personal account.

1:01:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Click on one, then it should be off user equals one.

1:01:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I can, I can join from the

1:01:55 - Jorge Lewis 
the browser with that signed into my personal one.

1:01:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:02:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
For, if you're using brave, which you should be, you should create two profiles.

1:02:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you're using brave, you should create two brave profiles, one for personal and one for work.

1:02:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So hopefully what doesn't end up happening is that we just end up watching these whole videos and we don't stop in the middle if, like, we don't stop them.

1:02:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's like the worst thing or what?

1:02:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, because the point isn't to watch the videos, it's to discuss the videos. Yeah. Hopefully our creativity does something. All right, I've got them here now.

1:03:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think just one person has to be in charge of when a point starts. So you just play the video and stop when you want to come in something. And then we just discuss that thing.

1:03:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then I can mention something if it's explicitly like something I want to talk about otherwise. Bad code is good.

1:03:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is pretty much the entire statement, I think. Although my title is ugly code is good. So I guess I think bad code is better, but yeah, let's get into it.

1:03:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
Lately I've been thinking a lot about bad code and how, honestly, it gets a bad rap.

1:04:17 - Speaker 1 
I really believe that writing bad code is a critical skill in a great software developer's tool belt. As crazy as that sounds, I hope by the end of this video, you'll think so as well.

1:04:31 - Speaker 1 
In case you're new here, let me introduce myself. My name's Troy and I've been writing code now for over 15 years. Throughout that time, I've worked for tons of companies from small early stage startups to huge tech giants like Amazon. Most recently, I co-founded my own startup where I'm the CTO and make all of the engineering hiring decisions. And one of the biggest problems that I see is that engineers aren't writing enough bad code.

1:05:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think that was his the nicest way you could put it that they're moving too slow.

1:05:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So what is bad code? Generally speaking, you can put bad code in three separate buckets. There's code that's poorly abstracted or tailor-built for one specific use case, the code that is slow or inefficient, and then there's just code that doesn't actually work. To be clear, I'm not trying to say that you should write code that doesn't work, but these first two are valuable tools to have in your tool belt when it makes sense for what you're working on. It's important to remember that when we're writing code, we're writing code for a business, and there's a real why behind the code we're writing. For example, say your business wants a way to send real-time messages back and forth between your customers. So you architect this really nifty solution that lets customers send messages that then go into some queue that automatically get prioritized by a series of customizable functions and then show up in a support queue for the designated department to address. That solution sounds awesome. The only problem is that your company is a soft drink distributor, and even at massive scale, you're only expecting to get 10 to 20 requests a day. So honestly, it would probably be better for you to just build a pretty basic real-time chat app by copying someone's tutorial on Medium. I remember at a previous company having a heated debate with a senior engineer that we had hired from some tech giant. He was pushing back on my suggestion to use a code generation tool called Hasura in our architecture. His argument was that at his previous company, they had used a code generation tool in the past, and when they got to a big enough scale, they had to move off of it, and it cost the company millions of dollars. From his perspective, that makes sense. He joined the company years and years after they started using that code generation tool and only really got to experience the pain from moving off of it. He was missing something, though. The company's decision to use that code generation tool was very likely the reason that they got to the scale that they did. It let them build faster, prove out the product market fit and make changes really quickly. Sure, having to spend a bunch of time rebuilding it sucks. But there's a very real chance that they would have never made it to the scale where that was necessary had they not decided to use it. We ended up moving forward with my suggestion and using Hasura, and the tech stack that I designed there has supported the company well through being valued over a billion dollars. The point I'm getting at here is that when we're developing, we have a ton of tools at our disposal. What's really important is that we pick the right one for our specific business needs. Knowing what tool you should reach for is what can make the difference between a good engineer and an absolute wizard. There's a tightrope that you have to walk between delivering business value and providing high-quality, scalable systems, and admittedly, it's a hard line to walk. I've worked with tons of brilliant people who get it wrong. To close, not every piece of code we write needs to be brilliant. I've written thousands upon thousands of lines of code that weren't well abstracted or super efficient. And most of that code is still being used years and years later. So please, go build an incredibly robust, efficient system when it's warranted. But don't be afraid to write some hacky, bad code when that's what the business needs. By the way, the majority of people watching aren't subscribed, so if you- Yeah, so what'd you think?

1:08:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he nailed one of the three main points down as abstraction, which I think is where we may be disagreeing, because I do not think abstraction is, like, not abstracting is an issue at all. I think not abstracting is very good code, because then you can jump in at any point, and you can just run through the file, see what it does, compared to if it's very abstracted, you have to get to know the code base very well to be able to work fast in it. But other than that, yeah.

1:09:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:09:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, he hit pretty much every point. Um, and you know, like we probably, we agree with most of what he said because his background is very similar. Well, other than the part where he worked at big companies, but he started his own startup and in startups, this, this whole bit is super important where if you're just moving too slow, the code that is good code, then you're not going to make it.

1:09:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it's also interesting that with Amazon being the big company is worked at, that means like for Amazon It's a tech giant, but their logistics lie in not specifically tech, if that makes sense, compared to Netflix, Google, like all of those live completely online. Amazon lives in real life and on text. I heard it quite like...

1:10:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Amazon has more logistics, but...

1:10:35 - Jorge Lewis 
You're like, this is a good example or at least just every example where it's just like, yeah, you, there's no, you have to understand the needs to, to figure out what, and the need is, is a, is part of understanding the vision and mission of, of the whole product or the whole project. If you don't understand that you're building for a hundred users and you're, you're trying to build a platform that scales for 10,000, like there's just something totally off. And I've got into this so many times with the team recently. Like, for example, for the milestones, the simplest way to do it is for every time the user inputs new tracking data, we're going to pull the list of milestones, all the milestones, we're going to pull the history of of the checking data, and we're going to do a couple things. Every time we get new tracking data, we're going to calculate the sum of that new tracking data. We're going to compare it to all of the milestones. Does it compare to all of them? In terms of efficiency, that is the Least efficient way like there's no I mean you could on purpose make it more less efficient But like just the default that's the default like you just pull everything you get everything and you can just compare it one by one That's the slowest way you could do it, but that is good enough like on the server side comparing what is it like 500 rows per user maybe two times three times a day isn't like you just have to compare put in richest in how relative it is to the project of the project like I don't know it's like how good do we have to make this code not good at all like I mean the what has nine actually started with was using an AI agent to compare the milestones that was kind of the code looked quite nice because it was all a prompt but the the simplest way is to just use if else statements if this is if the sum is greater than this or if the streak is greater than this so it's like the best code like the best way you could architect it would probably be I don't know storing some sort of values in a cache throughout the day or Like, there's different architectures you can apply to make this more efficient. Like, undoubtedly, but

1:13:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
To add on to that with, like, I remember before when we were building up the graphs and everything, getting the engineers on, we're storing all the events and all the messages just in the database. They want to optimize it. To instead store it in a cache and then upload to the database, not every single call, not having to get from the database every single time you open the application. But that's trying to optimize performance and trying to optimize database usage for all our total of zero users currently, which like, It's not where we should be. It's not what we need to be working on. Also, one of them suggested we should be backing up our servers. We have no valuable data on our servers. It's just kind of like the video by Code Statics, the triangle of velocity, Optimization and I have those videos queued up by the way.

1:14:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I have premature optimization queued up.

1:14:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1:14:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
But basically just know what to work out with on at which point, what is important to get down at which point and yeah. Yeah.

1:14:31 - Jorge Lewis 
It's interesting. I think our points so far have been not bad code, but more so Like so far, all we've mentioned is design or I guess planning or.

1:14:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I think it comes down to when you're working on an application, you need to think about like, what is the number one thing that needs to be done right now? Not what is something that could be nicer hair? Like what is the number one thing that's required from this feature? What's the number one thing?

1:15:15 - Jorge Lewis 
So one thing though, for Arrest for example, I've taken a look at that codebase and the whole superbase thing. It is terrible. It needs to be reworked. I'm trying to go into that codebase and change some things but it's just so tough because everything is so badly made. It was made in two days.

1:15:43 - Jorge Lewis 
There's, I guess, I don't know, it's like, there's also that side where it's just like, at some point, if you make code that's, or you design your, your, your code base, that's like made to last a week. I don't, I have to, and that's the code, that's the whole term code that, or tech debt, where it's like after a month, you have to refactor or not refactor, but you have to re kind of redesign, I guess.

1:16:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, rest is a smaller project, like in everything, so I don't know how accurately it applies, but... Your need to optimize it comes from it being, it working and it being out there so fast. Like you got it working and up there and got us clients through the application within two days. If you spent two weeks making it perfect, I don't think it would be as efficient at doing the thing it was like number one thing it was supposed to do, if that makes sense.

1:16:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Exactly. Like, and recreating it from scratch is not as much work. Like, so we're looking at two scenarios. The first scenario is you make it perfect the first time. The second scenario is you make it fast in two days and then you make it again for a week. I think the duration making it perfect the first time is longer than where you make it two times. It's the same with the, it's the idea with the pottery, the, the research or the study behind the pottery thing. Where it's like, if you make a lot of them, you'll get good at making pottery. If you make one perfect pottery, you're not going to get that good.

1:17:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:17:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Also taking the example in the video, the support ticket system. You can make the simple one, just customer sends a chat to support. Once that's in place, which takes super fast, it's much easier to recreate it and create the more advanced one when needed. It, then it would be to like create the more advanced one immediately because then you understand the needs, then you understand all the requirements, then you also haven't invested much time into it. And the time you have invested into it is a very simple piece of achieving this one mission.

1:18:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. One question I have is like, did Netflix design was their first, like when they, when they had their first, let's say 10 was that version of the code base scalable? Was that, could that handle hundred 10,000, thousand users?

1:18:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
No, no way. That's what the primogen has been working on. He made Falcor, which I don't know if you've heard him talk about Falcor, but I think it's the media codec relay thing that they used to send they send so much data out to users now, but like everything has to be scaled using microservices. It's definitely something that's been modified time and time again, and it's probably still constantly being optimized.

1:19:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Cause it's just like, like for example, the milestone thing, if we made the most efficient thing for what, like we're saving $10 over a year.

1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis 
for like super base calls, or we're saving, you know, like 50 milliseconds every day. I don't know. It's just, you really have to, it comes down to understanding what you need, not what you want, not what's sexy. It's like, what would be sexy is if we had the fastest thing. What was what Maiden?

1:19:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Facebook.

1:19:36 - Jorge Lewis 
PHP.

1:19:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I think they went through a process of going from PHP to, they made like their own compiler, their own like subscript of a PHP or something.

1:19:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Now, I mean, now I have no clue, but

1:19:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think they're using OCaml now pretty heavily at Facebook. And that's like a nitty-gritty functional programming language. And I think they went into the nitty-gritty functional fancy-schmancy perfect language way after the platform took off.

1:20:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but it's like those are...

1:20:23 - Jorge Lewis 
those are some really big scale projects where it's, it's very easy to take examples out of like, Oh, what was Facebook built off PHP? Okay, cool. So let's use what we know. I think everyone kind of understands, Oh, let's use what we know. Like, or I feel like that's easy to say, like we right now I'm good at Python, so I'm going to use Python and, and whatever front end I can use. But I feel like the bigger thing we should be going into is, is the more does Hmm.

1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause picking what you know is important, but like there's, there's also like a balance, like for example, so, so let's, um, let's go, there's two, there's a couple more videos. So let's go through one, one more and then see, and then just go from there.

1:21:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:21:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay. This one I quite liked. Let me share.

1:21:32 - Speaker 4 
In Canada, I was doing a project for a big communication company. This guy, we used to ride share and he'd come round and beep the horn and pick me up and it was like minus 30 outside. So I'd slide my way towards the car and every morning he was talking about functions. What do you think about that?

1:21:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Well, I think it depends on what stage you're in your business, what stage you are in. Like with Facebook, the OCaml is the beautiful functional programming language that he's mentioning. And that's because they need that artistic perfection at the moment with like the, but you don't need that one starting.

1:22:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But do there, They switched to OCaml not because it was beautiful, but because it was functional, like because it served its purpose.

1:22:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Of course. Yeah. I mean, that's the beauty in it, how perfectly it serves its purpose. That's at least one. Yeah.

1:23:00 - Jorge Lewis 
If I'm not mistaken, it's about to get into what I'm about to say, which is the like i've never thought about my code in terms of the code but just what it does like at the end like if I can do this like that's the beautiful part like the output these books like clean code and pragmatic programmer these these are very controversial there's actually a video I think I'm gonna look for it right now but while we're watching

1:23:25 - Jorge Lewis 
this there's The I'm gonna teach you how to create code that is clean or beautiful Which really means that it's easy to read. It's easy to maintain So there is some functional advantage to doing that but I just think a lot of people just get lost in the code and lose touch of what the point of the code is and exactly what

1:23:49 - Jorge Lewis 
we need to enforce within our company.

1:23:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think much more valuable books are like programming patterns, for example, learning how dependency injection works, learning what inheritance is, should you use it, when should you not use it, like learning all the patterns, not the ways to make it more readable.

1:24:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I've never actually read those books, but there was one video I mean, I'm looking for it, but I'll find overtime. I mean, it's just like, if you get lost in the code, it's very nice to see that you love what you do. But if you're spend, like, spend your, your, you know, your over out your extra time or doing that not not the time I pay you.

1:24:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Did bro get hacked? Yeah, he did. Me? Who? No, Asim.

1:25:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh.

1:25:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

1:25:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
RIP.

1:25:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
RIP.

1:25:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
He posted on our server too. Yeah, I see that.

1:25:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, you're ready.

1:25:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:25:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just kick him from the server. You can add him back when he's… Feels so bad. Rift my guy.

1:25:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Like you said, getting lost in the code, I'm not forgetting I get lost in the code. Sometimes I'm like, oh, this needs to be perfect. But I have time to lose. The extra four hours between 8 and 12 that I spend on it is to no one else's demise, but to mine. It's just because I want to finish that today, and no one else is paying for it. It's not like you're getting employed to do it.

1:26:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like I'm perfecting this because I find, I find a lot of joy in myself perfecting stuff, like going into stuff that isn't immediately useful because that's what's made me the programmer I am today. Like it's, I just like, it's more so the learning experience from perspective than perfecting it and figuring out how it works entirely. Not just to figure out that thing, but just to increase my knowledge overall, that that's the value.

1:26:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:26:54 - Speaker 4 
One way you can figure out if you're lost in the code yourself is to ask the question of, if I can automate all the coding and make it so that, I don't know, you just dictate through some sort of AI chatbot the requirements very specifically, but in natural English, and it just generated all the code for you, would you see that as a good thing or a bad thing. And I think from my perspective, surely it's a good thing. It's like how today, rather than spending days creating some kind of intricate photorealistic image, you can just type your prompt into Adobe Firefly or Mid Journey and it will create you an amazing looking image in 10 seconds. Surely that's a good thing, because If I can create software that fulfills some requirement in 10 seconds rather than 10 hours, then that's 10 hours of my time that I get back to potentially do more productive tasks. Because ultimately, code is just a tool to achieve some sort of outcome, to do some calculation or present something to the user in a certain way.

1:27:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you think that's how people like Hasnain, BOS, and Shinmay think of it? Do you think they think it's a tool to reach the outcome?

1:28:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm not quite sure, but for me, usually the coding part is never the issue, especially in the tech stack we're working in. The coding has only ever been an issue when I'm learning something new, and that's how that works. It's all just a bit business and state management, or like the business logic and state management, coding that in properly, which if I was prompting an LLM, I'd also have to explain it properly. Code is just a language to express the business logic and the state management.

1:28:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not the thing I'm trying to make beautiful. I'm just expressing myself in it, if that makes sense. Making that code beautiful or in the best optimized way possible has never been the issue. If I go into like some way like how to do this in JavaScript, that's to learn for myself so that I know in the future and can do it faster. It's not for any specific task ever. It's not to make any specific piece of code beautiful.

1:29:25 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what companies care about. And that's definitely what users care about. They don't care how beautiful your code is or whether you're using a functional or imperative programming language. I mean, the way that this guy in Canada was talking about our functional code was like, he'd just been on a first date or something. And now that I've...

1:29:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Did he start focusing around?

1:29:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
He'd just been on a first date or something.

1:29:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, is it?

1:29:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, it is.

1:29:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it 1S?

1:29:58 - Jorge Lewis 
And now that I've started building my own projects, like I built this thumbnail tool for YouTubers, and I'm having to realize that users don't care about my code, and there's a very good likelihood that the tool that I create, it's not going to be that useful that people are actually going to start using it depending on how good I market the tool, but if there's such a good likelihood that nobody's going to use it, then it's better to get the tool out there as quickly as possible without obsessing over the code quality, the test coverage, because until you get your software in front of the We've never we haven't done a single unit test in our at all

1:30:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
like Because it's you'd spend all this time making the video and The the thing that matters most if someone clicks on it and starts watching it is the thumbnail, which is the thing I'd probably want to spend the most time optimizing, if that makes sense. Like, I don't want to spend 18 hours making a video just to have an LLM generated shitty thumbnail that no one will click on, or few people will click on. That's like the eye catcher that needs to be optimized, right?

1:31:13 - Jorge Lewis 
this is you know that guy we met in um in the in the um the hoop what is it the shisha place um adam he he does like the you don't randomly like the automated youtube videos I'm guessing that's

1:31:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
what it's for oh yeah yeah lies the users don't care about my code code, and there's a very good likelihood that the tool that I create, it's not going to be that useful that people are actually going to start using it, depending on how good I market the tool. But if there's such a good likelihood that nobody's going to use it, then it's better to get the tool out there as quickly as possible.

1:31:57 - Jorge Lewis 
This guy needs to work on his... I've noticed this because I do this a lot. He adds a lot of cuts in the middle of his speaking, which is what you'd need to do when you don't plan what you're going to say, or you use a lot of filler words.

1:32:13 - Speaker 4 
Well, without obsessing over the code quality, the test coverage, because until you get your software in front of the eyes of users, you don't know whether it's actually solving a problem that they have. You don't know whether that software is going to go anywhere by obsessing over code.

1:32:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I didn't realize it until I said, without even saying something between. Maybe it's automated.

1:32:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's very, oh yeah.

1:32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause there's been like, I didn't realize it was that many.

1:32:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it cuts forward to him saying, ah, and then kind of get into him speaking.

1:32:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Maybe.

1:32:53 - Jorge Lewis 
You're procrastinating by doing something that's easy for you, which is polishing code endlessly, writing more and more tests until you feel completely satisfied rather than doing the hard thing, which is actually push that code to production, try to find

1:33:08 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm so glad our developers aren't experienced enough to even know what a unit test is. Like I'm so glad that I have not seen them make a single unit test. I don't know. Like there's the, there's the

1:33:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Unit tests are only useful if you have a very specific algorithm or something that you need to code for your specific business, and you need to test that that's working correctly. All our code is just something to do with the front end or directly interacting with database or AI, which is completely unpredictable. We never have code, which is running some calculation on like some person's account. Like that's something you test, like calculate this guy.

1:33:53 - Jorge Lewis 
We're only dealing with strings. Yeah. And the strings, there's no, there's no like extreme values.

1:33:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
There's just like, And extremely long string is extremely useful for applications where you have logic that's consistent. We don't have any logic that's consistent except for database interactions, which would be integration tests, not unit tests and just front end stuff, which doesn't need to be tested ever.

1:34:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So integration test is something that we should take a look at sometime soon.

1:34:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
integration tests are mostly useless and give you a false sense of security because what integration tests really do is make you put into code your perception of how the world works, not how it actually works. And then you're testing it against your perception of how a database works, not how an actual database works, if that makes sense. So you're always testing it against what you expect, not what you don't expect, which is what unit tests are better for.

1:35:09 - Jorge Lewis 
There's always a range of things that you could test for, and I guess when you test for those, that should be sufficient. If there was a way to test everything to 100% accuracy, this wouldn't even be a discussion. So I guess it's just a matter of, I hate this, but everything's a balance.

1:35:35 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I feel like most of our stuff is just a super basic wake call, like, get this table. Our stuff doesn't need any.

1:35:48 - Jorge Lewis 
It returns two things, data and error. If it has an error, you treat that error but if it doesn't then it's good.

1:35:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
A place to use an integration test is like if you have like an edge function and you want to make sure the edge function is returning the correct thing from your input. Yeah. Not if you just want to upload the thing to the db and for thread.

1:36:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah our programming is so simple really like it's just it's it's just very basic programming but we need to do it very like which makes it that if we do a bad job, it's pretty obvious. Like if we use three, four loops in a loop, that's like our really, really, that's our only code. Like we don't have much code really like,

1:36:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, three.

1:36:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

1:36:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, three. Oh, three. No.

1:36:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, I've never, I didn't study computer science, why would I? I did a competitive program, I should know.

1:36:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I wouldn't. My programs were always log n.

1:37:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Wow.

1:37:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

1:37:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Log n?

1:37:09 - Jorge Lewis 
No, but like, our code base is so simple. It's like, if you really take a look at it, there's there's not much code, like there's no, like there's no, nothing needs to scale, nothing like, I don't know.

1:37:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:37:37 - Speaker 4 
That software and face the reality of whether what you've created is part of Steaming Turd or actually it's the seed of an idea that could go somewhere. I have been the person that's been polishing code for a lot of my career. I kind of became obsessive.

1:37:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Now that I mentioned it, he just has so many cuts. Like I can't stop seeing them now.

1:38:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Test coverage, clean code principles, naming and all these things are really important if you're working on a code base which is going to be used by like hundreds or thousands of developers. But there was this one time I was leading a particular project and all the times that my boss was telling me that we really need to speed this along and I was polishing the code endlessly like the software was somehow An extension of me and if I didn't make it good, then I wouldn't be good. But now I see that boss's perspective and kind of wish that I'd said to him, Hey, we're going to push something out the door and it's, it's not going to be great, but we'll see whether this feature is actually something that's going to be useful to the customers or not. And in some way, beginners have a big advantage here because they don't even know that clean code is a thing, but they don't know the methods that are hundreds.

1:38:54 - Jorge Lewis 
That's actually a good point. He was shipped his code like super fast because he used tried catch everywhere. But that's a point I want to touch on later. I actually have a talking point. I have two talking points. One of them is how the experience and skill of a programmer affects the whole statement of ugly code.

1:39:16 - Speaker 4 
Lines long are necessarily less readable. Beginners are just focused on getting their web page or application to work.

1:39:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess that's one of the benefits. That sounded very nice actually. A junior developer, all they're trying to do is to get it to work. And that's all you're trying to do in a business world. You need it to work. You need it to accomplish what it needs to do. That's it.

1:39:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
I feel like you're right, but the problem is juniors don't know what is needed. They usually have the wrong perception of what is needed to make it work and end up working on things that are not relevant.

1:40:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. For them, what's needed is just whatever's in their head and it works great if it's their portfolio website, but yeah.

1:40:19 - Speaker 4 
that are hundreds of lines long aren't necessarily less readable. Beginners are just focused on getting their web page or application to work. Once you've been in the software development industry, especially if you've been working for larger companies, you get this mentality that...

1:40:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Why was there an electric scooter?

1:40:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Industry, especially if you've been working for a large...

1:40:42 - Jorge Lewis 
What?

1:40:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh no, it's not electric. That's not electric. That's just...

1:40:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's kind of a given that you're gonna make the solution. What's the next challenge? You can do it's make this solution work plus make it as polished as you possibly can and Hopefully later down the line when people talk about that project, they'll be like that code man.

1:41:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
That was something else I As you know I think in my previous company I was like working for large part converting a legacy code old 20 into from Visual Basic to new C sharp laser amazing everything you know yeah that code base was something else yeah There were comments in both English and Norwegian, and most of them weren't explaining why anything was done. It was just like, this line does this. Thank you. Yeah, I could read that, but why?

1:41:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Comments is a whole topic of itself.

1:41:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:42:01 - Jorge Lewis 
He brings a good point that I think about it. No one gets praised for good code. When have you gotten praised for good code?

1:42:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing is, I think if I code good code, if I learn how to code good code, just to play devil's advocate, what happens is the next time I'm coding something similar or like what I learned from that, I can apply to a lot of scenarios and therefore move faster. I can move faster than B was has name, whatever, is because I have just like gone into the deep dive on so many topics that I know where I should prioritize my time where I shouldn't. And I already know, like conceptually, how I should be structuring things and where I should be putting my focus, where And I know the implementation techniques fully. So all I'm thinking about is the business logic and like, yeah, just states. I'm not thinking about implementation details at all.

1:43:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And that's exactly where my statement of how the experience of a programmer affects the whole statement. Cause if you're building code, that's just like just terrible. It could either be because you're trying to do it fast or it's because you don't know better. And if it's because you don't know better, then you have to be like, okay, if I don't know better, is the better solution, so for example, the try-catch.

1:43:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Why do senior engineers tell juniors not to use a try-catch statement? If at the end of the day, it makes the code ship faster.

1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Because in the long term they'll become a better fast-removing developer if they don't try catch Yeah, I when when he Like when I removed his try catches, it's not like I removed them and that's it. I had to I had to catch the error somewhere but there's a proper way to catch the errors that not only allows you to move faster in the future, but that's also more, like it's just more efficient in the longterm. It's easier to read for developers. There's like, I don't want to go into the specifics of like, Oh, when you use proper error catching and typing, you can, you know, blah, blah, blah. Like that, that part's obvious, but I feel like I'm trying to apply a general statement where it's like, if you learn, and it's exactly what he said, if you learn the best practices and kind of, how to make better code, you apply that in the future to be faster. It's similar with, if you learn how to properly catch an error from Superbase, you'll have to learn it once and you can apply it every single time.

1:44:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think where the problem comes in is when you're trying to put glazing on a cape, which you're only making once. If you're improving codes on a code base, that's totally irrelevant to every other project. It's like a piece of code you're only ever going to code on this project. And the thing you're optimizing and making pretty is something that's something How should I put it? That won't translate moving forwards. That's when it's a problem. That's when it's not worth it. But if it's a problem like you don't know how to handle errors in TypeScript, then you should learn how to handle errors in TypeScript because it's just a thing you know, and when you know it, you know it. But if it's like, you have this function and this function could be translated into a class, which could be used as a factory hair and hair and hair. That's not useful because that's just translating it into something you think is prettier. You already know how to implement both patterns and everything, but it's not useful. It doesn't speed you up. It doesn't teach you anything for the long term.

1:46:01 - Jorge Lewis 
It's only like, I wonder how different our perspective on programming is. Compared to people that went to computer science that took degrees because from what I know is they learn a lot of theory and they learn some practical stuff like they might learn some C++ to learn an algorithm. They do algorithms in their own code, maybe just JavaScript. They learn things like classes and inheritance all through theory. I learned that stuff in my code. So it's just, I'm, I feel like we're so out of sync with these guys, like with the general population of programmers where they learn things the formal way. So maybe it's just tough to see, see it from their eyes and

1:46:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, like, because they've learned it from theory, they could go, hey, this file, the functions in this file should be part of a class, they shouldn't be functions. Meanwhile, like, an actual problem that they should be focusing on takes is, I don't know how to handle errors. Let's learn how to handle errors. That's just like a straight up objectively better thing like that's going to help you long term and that you're always going to apply compared to an opinion piece on what's theoretically better.

1:47:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like, for example, for me, I've I, I don't remember learning classes. The only way the only reason I know classes is because I know of the concept of what a class is, which is it's just groups, properties, and functions together. And it's just a more compact way. I don't know. I'm just getting back to my point of I'm trying to view the code how they see it, which is so rigid. It has to be this way.

1:48:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not even it has to be this way, just I think it would be a better practice to do it this way, even though the other way already works and is in place and everyone understands it. I think it would be better practice if we put this AI file, made it a class, added the properties here that we actually just store in states for now, like just converting a thing that works into another thing that works, that they deem as prettier.

1:48:50 - Jorge Lewis 
It also goes down, like going down that rabbit hole, it's just like, The prettiest thing is what everybody understands the most.

1:49:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Like if everybody understands, like if your company or if you're like, usually for us, at least for small agencies, there's a style that people use or that the company uses. And for us, we have our style. We can't, we maybe can't define it in words, but we do definitely have it. And if we just keep that style consistent, that's the most efficient way to go.

1:49:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, that's the whole argument for why formatters and keeping code style is important because formatters allow coders to code in any style they prefer. But when it's formatted, the look will be consistent. As you scroll through files, your eyes will be better trained to catch and interpret what's on your screen.

1:49:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I mentioned this earlier, but I couldn't pin it down. But what we should be focusing on here is not, I think, the code aspect because, or at least for us, have you had a developer trying to make their code perfect when programming? For me, I've only noticed that when design, like architecting a solution, designing a solution.

1:50:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
For me, I've only noticed that when I already have the solution and I'm like, but these two functions could be one function and the parameter that I'm passing in here could be a property.

1:50:36 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, exactly. Like that's what I do as well. Like for the rest thing, everything was like its own thing. And at the end of it, I was like, Oh, let's just make this a class. It was just, it was done within five minutes.

1:50:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so I do clean up my code. I don't like, it's just.

1:50:56 - Jorge Lewis 
It's so, the whole topic is so...

1:51:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the problem is when you're trying to make the clean code first, like you afterwards saw, oh, this can be a class and then made it a class. If you're before that trying to plan, okay, this should be a class because I have properties. That's when the problem comes in because then you're taking a long time thinking about how it should be structured and so just implementing it and then formulating it afterwards.

1:51:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And I could see university students going down that road because they learned, Oh, we need classes to make code. We need to make our code, our code using classes. So first let's start with what classes we need. But rather if you start from a functional first standpoint, it's like, what do we need? Okay. We're going to need this ID. We're going to need this, this, uh, post title, et cetera.

1:51:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Should you even switch from classes or from functions to classes?

1:51:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think in any of our, like even Adapt, I don't think we have a single class. And classes are like kind of this dumb. I think structs are the ones that are being loved more so now, just like having proper objects. But all of that just comes down to opinion pieces, as I mentioned, like how you structure it shouldn't be the important thing.

1:52:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's just I feel like it's just every time you speak, it's getting into this one point of how experience does matter. Because if we told our junior developers to ship code as fast as possible, every single time, they would never learn how to handle errors. Yeah, it's like So it's that and that's what my life my whole programming journey has been it's been to ship as fast as possible because From making video games. I don't care about how good or how pretty my code is like never like So, but at what point did I learn?

1:53:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I should be air checking and I I I think you kind of, I mean, like, just after having experience and having the goals set by yourself, while when you're creating five prior catches, you kind of realize, hmm, this can just error and I don't know what will happen. What will save me time in the long term and will be a thing that I just have to learn once that is how to handle layers properly so I don't suffer down the road and so I don't like or so that I just work more efficiently in general. So then we just look up the documentation. It's like the same with ShedCN. If like when we started with ShedCN, we wanted to make a landing page, The fastest way we could do it is just do it tailwind, draw tailwind, just YOLO. But we know that like, hey, ShadCN is going to be the thing we're going to be using. It's going to be helping us. It's going to be keeping things properly consistent with UI and everything. The benefits are worth it. And it's a thing to just learn once, then we apply it. That's when clean code does matter, if that makes sense. But that's not clean, that's making it readable. No, that's not making it readable, that's actually practical. Same with the error handling, that's not making it readable, that's the practical difference.

1:54:33 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a practical difference, but in the code it's...

1:54:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So who... So this statement, I came up with a statement because I, I guess I assumed it's the common notion. So I was, of course, when you, when you think of titles, you think you're trying to think of something, uh, like with, with, uh, conflict, I guess. So, which means that the Going with the grain would mean that making your code look pretty is, is the best way to go. But I don't think that's, that's how it is in the world. I think it's.

1:55:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the term people use is clean because it's not about making it pretty, it's about keeping it readable and clean.

1:55:23 - Jorge Lewis 
But that's not like a big issue in this.

1:55:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Making it readable is not an issue because we have formatters and we have Like for me, the issue is people over engineering solutions or or designing solutions that just aren't what we need over engineering. So.

1:56:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
be like, that code man, that was something else. But what really matters was the outcome of the project and the users that you served. And hey, if you can serve those users just as well with a monolithic application rather than a microservices architecture, then why the hell not? So the This is just a reminder to remember why you're writing code. Is it because you really love code or is it because you want to create something that code allows you to? Maybe once you figure that out, you'll do like I'm trying to do and not spend so long obsessing over the tiny details that aren't actually important.

1:56:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
The last part is actually pretty interesting because I feel like my adventure with coding was I want to create games, so I'm going to learn how to code to make this thing for my game. Then I really liked the coding, so I coded more things for the game. And then, like, as I got into coding and started loving coding more than creating the thing, I got into, like, other parts of coding which are more technical, less visual, like CLI tools, whatever.

1:57:08 - Jorge Lewis 
But did you fall in love with the coding or with the things that coding brings, which is doing, like, you can make things happen with code?

1:57:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's still making things happen, but it's got less visual.

1:57:27 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, I don't think, and maybe, maybe there's people, maybe like our team, and this is like, we need to figure this out. It's like, do they validate, like, are they looking at the code from a perspective of like, oh, look how, look how good this code is. I go from this to this instead of just like, oh, I have the output.

1:57:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know if I explained that very well.

1:57:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I remember when we were going over the fact that our client is the one that owns the code we write, that was quite the reaction out of one of our developers. Because he values the code, not the product. The code he wrote, that's his hard work. The product that comes out of it, that's their product. But the code he wrote, that's his code. That's his baby.

1:58:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and for me, it's easy to say. For me, my hard work is the things I've learned through that project. From all the projects I've made, what I take most of it is the learning, because I can scratch whatever I've made, make it again, better, faster. And in the back of my head, maybe there'll always be that, oh, I wasted all that time making that previous version. But it's like, did you really? I don't know.

1:58:54 - Jorge Lewis 
But at least this new version, it's fast, it's better.

1:58:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:59:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
All right.

1:59:04 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think, was this just a, I don't know, we were going to watch this one.

1:59:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Here.

1:59:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Grandpa. It's time for grandpa.

1:59:15 - Jonas Lindberg 
Grandpa?

1:59:17 - Jorge Lewis 
With the most clickbait title.

1:59:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, yo, it's this guy, continues to deliver.

1:59:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
We all say that code is bad, this code is terrible.

1:59:30 - Speaker 2 
But what does it mean? And what should we do about it? That's our topic for today.

1:59:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hi, I'm Dave Farley, Continuous Delivery, and welcome to CICD.

1:59:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Mr. Who?

1:59:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Mr. TDD. He is a huge advocate of learning test-driven development and using it consistently throughout your coding as the foundation of how you think. I see. So I'm quite excited to see his opinion. If you haven't been here before, please do hit subscribe.

2:00:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
I hope you enjoy the content.

2:00:16 - Speaker 2 
Today hit like as well. Bad code is probably a bad name for bad code, but at least colloquially, if not technically, we all know what we mean when we say it. That is not how I would have done it. Or if it's our code, that's bad. It's not how I do it now with the benefit of hindsight, bad code is code.

2:00:36 - Jorge Lewis 
This is just totally irrelevant, but one thing that I, I don't know if it's a language barrier. But some naming conventions, or not conventions, the naming of things I've seen are just so bad.

2:00:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Like they represent nothing of what they should be.

2:01:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So just keep that in your mind.

2:01:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Is not how I would have done it. Or, if it's our code that's bad, it's not how I'd do it now, with the benefit of hindsight. Bad code is code that is difficult, or at least unpleasant, to work on. In this episode, I want to explore what bad code really is, what's a sensible practical definition for good code, and what it takes to build good code and avoid traps in bad code based on some real-world examples. Fundamentally, bad code is defined, I think, by two things. Either it doesn't do what it should, or even if it does do what it should, it's too hard to change it when we need to change it. I'd argue that that's it. Everything else is changed.

2:01:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So if we use these two constraints, then the code I wrote for REST would be bad code because it's hard to change.

2:01:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I disagree. If you wrote it in two days, you can change it completely in two days.

2:02:06 - Jorge Lewis 
By remaking it, you mean? Yeah. Yeah.

2:02:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
And I think coding in a way that's easy to change would be more harmful because it would be structured in a worse way than the recreation would be. And it would take probably more than four days to create it in a very easy to change way.

2:02:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So for us, these small components where it takes days or even a week or even a couple weeks, then remaking things make more sense. But for, something that where you quote, it's going to take a couple of weeks or months, then remaking it doesn't make any sense. Like you want to design it properly, but I guess like it's just a whole different ballpark. It's you're, you're either going to, you're either dealing with something that you've never done before and that's why you're making it fast or you're, you're dealing with something that is going to last a thousand years.

2:03:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like the two prongs of programming what you're making will either be disregarded within a month or it'll last for 20 years. There is no in between.

2:03:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Change it when we need to change it. I'd argue that that's it. Everything else is secondary to those two things. If it does what it's meant to, and it's easy to change, then it's good code. This is not about engineering as art, or over-engineering, or software developers being over-precious about the beauty in their code. This is practical, pragmatic stuff. It works, and it's easy to...

2:03:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Does it remind you of Cohen?

2:03:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That one sentence, the past five seconds.

2:04:01 - Jorge Lewis 
rewind it this is practical pragmatic stuff it works and it's easy to change these things have a direct bottom line impact on the product I don't know just just like I feel like I've heard this definition for good code and what it takes to build good code and avoid traps in bad code based on some real-world example.

2:04:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think the reason why it resonates, like, reminds me of Kuen is because it's trying to be technical from a completely non-technical perspective. Yeah, it's like Because writing good code takes effort, but effort is the product of our work. I feel like I'm hearing nothing, it's producing nothing, and it's going out as nothing.

2:04:56 - Speaker 2 
Argue that that's it. Everything else is secondary to those two things.

2:05:00 - Jorge Lewis 
That line right there, like, and that's it. Everything else is secondary. That line, like... Do these guys take the same adjusts, Chrome Master, Black Belt?

2:05:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's easy to change.

2:05:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is not so much the effects of something as hard to change.

2:05:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Like hard to change, bro. Make it a microservice. Like then you're, you technically have good code.

2:05:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

2:05:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Like if you make microservices, then it's easy. What was his two conditions?

2:05:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like, if you remember from the end of the other video, that one said, like, you shouldn't like, if it's a microservice or a monolith, it doesn't matter. But microservices are quite inherently difficult because you have to, structure in a way where it can be a microservice. Like, you know, the, the, for us with a depth, just having our Python API and the other thing, imagine having like another Python API for every single function that can be done. Yeah. Just to make it so that it's easy to interchange.

2:06:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'm saying bad code is good for, for most people, for most projects. When do I want to change my code? Like when, in what scenario do I want to change my code?

2:06:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. So, so I guess in with his definition, bad code is good because I want things to be like, I don't need, Because or it's assuming that making bad code is fast.

2:07:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Like that's what it's assuming because making things that are hard to change is fast. Like doesn't do its job. Like that just, that doesn't, that just, that's not even code.

2:07:18 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like code is, I mean, I think he's just using the term bad and going, yeah, but code that doesn't do its job. Of course that's bad.

2:07:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is actually from the other video as well. There's three of them.

2:07:36 - Jorge Lewis 
There's three of them and he pointed out two of them. I can't remember.

2:07:50 - Speaker 2 
I'd argue that that's it. Everything else is secondary to those two things. If it does what it's meant to and it's easy to change, then it's good code. This is not about engineering as art or over-engineering or software developers being over-precious about the beauty in their code. This is practical, pragmatic stuff. It works and it's easy to change. These things have a direct bottom line impact on the productivity as well as quality of the systems that we build. If you want to go quickly and build lots of features, you don't get to do that by cutting corners and writing bad code fast. You do it by working more carefully to create good code from the start. And so saving lots of unnecessary time and effort correcting the fallout that your bad code caused later on. I wish that more of us techies believed that and defended that idea more strongly to misguided people pressuring us to cut corners.

2:08:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can I make one comment here? Because cutting corners simply doesn't work.

2:08:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
So he's arguing that creating this bad code, this hard to change code, is something that will directly affect the bottom line, down the line, because it's something that will have to be changed. But I'd argue having to change it and it affecting the bottom line is a great sign of its success. If your codes that you've wrote that's hard to change is used so much that you have to rewrite it, that's a great piece of code. And it's great that you've got it out there.

2:09:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I can see your point.

2:09:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
When you have the funds to do a massive rewrite, which affects the bulk of this thing that was created before, that was created in a hard-to-change way, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. If you are in the position where you have to change old code, yeah, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

2:10:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because that means you're in Dora data.

2:10:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Says that teams that produce higher quality code are significantly more efficient overall, spending 44% more of their time.

2:10:34 - Jorge Lewis 
I wonder where this came from That has to be enterprises.

2:10:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:10:45 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's interesting because this guy, whoever he is, saying this, you have to understand his audience are people like Chinmay, Biwas, and just people that, like programmers. And a majority of them don't work at enterprises. They work at, if it's a medium company, then sure. But if they're either doing their own projects or they're doing, they're working at a startup or at an agency as a freelancer, then this just does not apply to them. If anything, it's the opposite.

2:11:21 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm producing new features than teams that don't. 44%, that's a big win. Quality matters for commercial reasons because we go faster overall and we create better.

2:11:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I don't, how does that?

2:11:39 - Jorge Lewis 
44% their time.

2:11:42 - Jorge Lewis 
How does this work? Like, so it's saying...

2:11:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
High-performing organizations, so yeah, enterprises. Done 22% less time on unplanned work than reworked as a result.

2:11:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:12:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I feel like this data, this is...

2:12:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
I feel like this is someone that implemented agile with their 25 meetings per week. And the actual work that's being done, yeah, it's always on like the task they planned, but the time they took to plan it is probably like a 200% like that's hidden from this graph because here they're only considering unplanned work and planned work. Also, if they were planning the work, if they included one more for like how much time is spent planning the work, I'd love to see that.

2:12:37 - Jorge Lewis 
It's okay. So there's also the big thing I think is reworking. When you're reworking, you're forgetting that it provided so much, it provided value like with, Like you're reworking it because it provided value, like going off your point. If it didn't provide value, we wouldn't be reworking it. But if it was perfect, so what would be the downside of making it perfect? Is you would risk spending time, well.

2:13:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
You only know what perfect is in the scenario where you have to rework it. That's when you have enough context to like properly do it.

2:13:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Perfect.

2:13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
And that's when you're making things that have been done before. So, but like, that's when you're making things that have been done before and you have reference to that. So you're in an enterprise where you can refer to a bug that took 20 hours of somebody else's time to solve. And you can just look at their log, like their log that they took eight hours to make. But if you're in a startup looking at a stack overflow that someone spent two minutes writing, that's not going to help you make a perfect solution.

2:13:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's very applicable. Reworks are kind of necessary in smaller, in anything but enterprise or at least in anything innovative because you will not have, like whatever you're making has not been done to the T before. If it has then what are you doing? Then you're doing something like error handling which you should learn Right Yeah, like I mean if Okay, for example when for us we're storing our messages our AI messages on a database instead of caching them on a writer server or whatever If whatever we are making right now, this chatbot, this adapt, or this chatbot that relies heavily on long-term data where the time of day matters a lot, the number of sessions per day matters a lot, and et cetera, then we would just implement their solution. And we'd have kind of a perfect solution because they iterated on it so many times before.

2:15:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I'd say every case, that's not the case. You're either using a different stack, you have one feature that's different that affects the rest of it. So rework is almost always necessary at anything but enterprise level. At medium scale businesses, even there, even enterprise businesses, at most points you've reworked.

2:15:34 - Jorge Lewis 
like when you don't rework we're talking about like UI and like frontend and and like I don't know maybe I don't know what I'm talking about I'm producing new features than teams that don't 44%, that's a big win.

2:15:51 - Speaker 2 
Quality matters for commercial reasons because we go faster overall and we create better quality code. So as software professionals, we have a professional duty of care to do a good job. This is not about self-indulgence or over-engineering. This is what we are paid to do, our professional duty of care to build software as efficiently as we can.

2:16:15 - Jorge Lewis 
To do that, we need So this was relying on the assumption that if you make better code, it'll save time in the long run, which is not the case for us.

2:16:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I kind of disagree with that. Like fundamentally coming back to my point, like if I, like if my employee wrote a piece of code that was so important that we have to rework it, that's great.

2:16:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
If that costs us time down the line, that means it made us enough money to where we're spending money on fixing it and making it better.

2:16:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like if REST didn't bring the value that it did, I wouldn't be working on it right now.

2:17:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. I don't want an employee to spend more time than they have to on a piece of code, which could be from the trash or could be over optimized in some way. I want them to focus on the core value. Just implement that. Don't make it scalable. Don't make it clean. Don't make it in a way where we can improve on it. Just make it. If it works great, then we invest in it.

2:17:25 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's like for me, so, and also I think it's more enjoyable making things from again, rather than improving your, like Rather than improving something that was structured before you knew the end goal.

2:17:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or before you knew what it looked like in practice more accurately.

2:17:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:17:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Need to build high quality software, not create crap quickly. Because if we optimize to build...

2:17:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I like crap quickly.

2:17:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:17:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
If it's working crap, that's so valuable, I need to rework it.

2:18:04 - Jorge Lewis 
If you make working crap, you're a good programmer. I think that's the title. If you make working crap, that you're a good programmer. A good programmer is someone that does the best for their time.

2:18:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me pause there and say thank you to everyone.

2:18:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm going to start saying that to everybody.

2:18:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Not working, valuable. If you make crap so valuable, we have to rework it. That's it.

2:18:41 - Jorge Lewis 
But when you're saying valuable, it's so ambiguous. Working, it's more clear. Cause it's like, what does working mean? And this relies on them understanding what is the, like, what do we need from this whole system?

2:18:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
But you get what I'm saying?

2:18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like we need, we don't, we don't need anything good.

2:19:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
We are extreme. You start the routine. I support void it. Here is chat. GPTs take on defining bad code. It's not perfect, but it's also not a bad summary either. So if bad code is hard to maintain.

2:19:22 - Jorge Lewis 
It's it's just these buckets are just.

2:19:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Like who made these buckets? Or who made who? Why is this unscalable code bad? It's not because like,

2:19:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I mean, I'd agree with these, that these are the ones that are generally considered bad code though. What do you think about the security? Like if, if one of our employees coded something that like used, for example, server authenticated code on the front end, which just is impossible to use in production, but it's working and doing kind of the things it's supposed to. What do you think then?

2:20:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because it's very easy to speed up development of features by ignoring authentication as an example, by ignoring row-level security, by ignoring all those things.

2:20:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
That lets you ship a lot faster, or that lets you get to a point where the application is working and the ship will stay much faster. But it will be very insecure.

2:20:42 - Jonas Lindberg 
So you'll have to fix that before shipping to production.

2:20:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Then clearly it isn't easy to change. If it has scalability issues, then it doesn't really work as it's meant to. And all of these other things also fall into my two categories of doing what it's meant to, and then being easy to change.

2:21:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Which I think are the simple and more foundational...

2:21:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like a lot of these... He's, he's, I feel like at this, this is the point of the video where experience doesn't do its job.

2:21:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
If it, like, if I need a feature, which is innovative, a feature, which hasn't been made before, and you make it work with like HTML, no CSS looks, I don't care. You made the feature work. We can improve upon it then. Like we know it works. We know it's valuable. We can improve upon it.

2:21:48 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not, not doing its job.

2:21:53 - Jorge Lewis 
How about this? This whole title is wrong because what your code looks like has no correlation to how good a programmer you are.

2:22:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'd argue somewhat it does, because a lot of what dictates how your code looks like, it's just how much you know about the language. But at a certain point, it doesn't matter anymore. Like, do you know how to error handle? Yes, then it'll look better. No, then it'll look worse. And it'll dictate if you're good. But it's not the thing that dictates if you're good. It's just an indicator of experience for yourself.

2:22:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like a good programmer knows error handling in general. A good programmer knows typing in general. So.

2:22:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, for.

2:22:54 - Jorge Lewis 
You know, for example, like, Like so. Take REST as an example. I just got into Lanchain at that time and just got into, that was my first personal project for Install Kit. The code was terrible, but I would still say at that point I was a good programmer.

2:23:22 - Jorge Lewis 
My code looked like I was a first time TypeScript developer, but if you took someone that has been developing for 50 years, They could see the patterns of, oh, this guy understood this principle of this and this. So, yeah, I didn't do proper typing. I used any. I didn't use nulls. I used question marks. I didn't even try catches, though. Sorry, B-West.

2:23:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is a nitpick, but I disagree with the typing. I think that's just inexperienced with the language because no matter what I'm doing, I can do the typing properly because now I understand TypeScript typing so well that I can just like, I can get the LSP to tell me what I need to type like in two seconds. And then I type it and it makes me work faster because the intellisense helps me.

2:24:18 - Jorge Lewis 
But, but this, this, this statement saying if your code, is using any, you're a bad programmer. I wouldn't say I was a bad programmer, but I was using any.

2:24:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think it just indicates your experience with the specific programming language more so than if you're a good programmer or not.

2:24:38 - Jorge Lewis 
And it also depends at what experience level, how long you've been doing that, and if you're still doing the same things that you were doing a year ago. Like I stopped using any after that one project because I learned it since then. So it's like, for example, if you're using try and catch, if no one tells you to learn error handling, you will always use try and catch.

2:25:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
And more useful ideas. Fundamentally good code needs.

2:25:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

2:25:05 - Jorge Lewis 
It just comes back to the point of how your experience affects the statement. Like if you're a junior engineer, I would say that. The code you make, if we make the same code as a junior and a senior, it's a whole different world. Because as a senior, I understand the principles going on behind everything. I'm trying catching so I can save this five minutes so that I can just see my output. You're trying catching because you don't know how to air handle. Or you don't know that there is air handling.

2:25:45 - Jorge Lewis 
At some point you want to learn things and to make your code better. You could say like error handling and using classes when you should and that just comes with experience. I'd argue against that one.

2:25:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
The using classes when you should, when to use classes over time. Functions and state and sub-stores, for example. I think that's just all opinion pieces. It's all going to be opinion pieces.

2:26:11 - Jorge Lewis 
No, that's what I just said. It's experience. You gain an intuitive feeling of, oh, I want to use a class here. Why? It feels better.

2:26:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe, but I think the arrow hunting is more set in stone. But the classes, I think it's almost going to be like, it'll flip back and forth depending on experience. You just start out, you don't even know classes or anything. You learn about classes, classes are great, always use classes. You learn when to use them, okay, never use classes. Then you learn object-oriented programming, use classes. Then you learn, oh, functional programming is a thing, never use classes. Then you just flip that. Error handling is like, when you learn it, now I can do it.

2:27:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and then you always do it. Or at least you do it better every time. For me, the first time I did error handling, The first time I did error handling, I just checked if error. And then as I went on, I was like, okay, if error or if no data, okay, if error, then do this, like you just learn over time. Um, but like, for example, the, for the point of like, where things are just ambiguous, like when should I use a class? One of our team members working on, on, um, on a simulation feature, he was like, he used a recursive function over a for loop. So I asked him, we pseudocoded a for loop, why have you changed it to a recursive function? And he was like, hmm, we could do both. We could do a for loop. And I was like, yeah, we could. Why do you use a recursive function? He couldn't really come to an answer.

2:27:58 - Jorge Lewis 
In the actual scenario, I would say they're about even in terms of pros and cons. But it's just a matter of me, I would use a for loop. And I would say I'm more experienced than him. So you could say the better answer is a for loop. But at that point, I'm not helping him by saying you should use a for loop. I'm just saying, OK, cool. Why did you use a recursive function instead? And then he's trying to think it through for himself. And then I'm like, OK, cool. The next time he's working on something similar, he'll think again, oh Jorge asked me that one time, should I be using a recursive function or for loop?

2:28:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'm going to be honest, I've never ever made a recursive function outside of what's a recursive function.

2:28:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
I haven't either.

2:28:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've never made a recursive function like that. I think you can just achieve the same thing with a for loop and being smart about the flow state.

2:29:08 - Jorge Lewis 
But you see, he's done these code questions, so he was thinking recursive function, binary tree, binomal ethereal.

2:29:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing is, if he used that because that was a solution he had in his head, great. But if he used a recursive function over a for loop, which he would have done better, if that's the scenario, then it's kind of bad. But I'm guessing just because he does those code questions and that, the recursive function was just natural to him.

2:29:44 - Jorge Lewis 
And just as long as I prompt the question in his head, Because what's default to him is the recursive functions. But we should be promoting the critical thinking where should I be doing this or this? That's all we have to do. We can let him do the rest. And that's like classes. Should I be using a class or should I not?

2:30:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Play devil's advocate there. That's not where critical thinking matters. That's where like, if I, if I like, that's the reason I've never used recursive functions because like, to me, it's always using a recursive function. The only purpose would be to make it fancier, to make it prettier because I can achieve everything I need to with for loops. And those were great. I've never needed recursive functions. I've tried them out.

2:30:34 - Jorge Lewis 
like there hasn't been scenarios where Yeah, how no we've had to have made a recursive function, but just not realize like we've had to know we've we've had like We just I don't want to think that I've made a

2:30:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
recursive function once and it was in a recursive function tutorial and You see where I'm coming from, like, I don't know if that's where we need to promote critical thinking because then they'll be hung up and should I use a for loop here or a poster function? Well, you should just use what's natural. Like it doesn't matter.

2:31:15 - Jorge Lewis 
They do that. That thought process will become natural at a point where it's like, should I make a class or not? Um, yeah. And there's, Sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's subconscious, where you have reasons, you're like, okay, I've reused this thing three times and I want to make it on property, I want to add a function to it.

2:31:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think for that kind of question, what it really comes down to is which will be easiest to implement, which do I think will be the best one to work with in the future, and which one do I want to learn more about. For me, If I want to use the class in TypeScript, I know I'm going to be slower. I don't know if it's going to be easier to work with in the future. So it's likely going to be because I wanted to learn how to use classes more.

2:32:06 - Jorge Lewis 
You know, I've never made, I've made like probably one class in TypeScript.

2:32:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. It's like, you don't need them.

2:32:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
You don't really need passes at all, you just need objects.

2:32:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Objects and then you just hammer out the object until it's in the correct form. You don't need to attach the functions to the object. Like, yeah, that's the whole thing with functional programming. Oh yeah, we've got a lot left of the video.

2:32:33 - Jorge Lewis 
The next one is big premature optimization. Oh.

2:32:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Everything else is just a special case of those two things. It's possible that I'm being a little bit overly reductive here, but in this case, I don't really think so, because I can make my code scalable or write it to eliminate security vulnerabilities, and it still might be bad code if it's hard to maintain or offers a poor user experience. So if you fix all of these things, is the code good now? Well, maybe, maybe not. To achieve good code, our code needs to fix all of these.

2:33:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know how true this is, but it's just a thought. How do you know what is maintainable? That's like, we're talking about the future. How do you know the future? Like if we're talking about a, like you just don't like, or at least in all of my experiences, like for rest, there would be no way.

2:33:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Or I think there are tools which objectively keep things more maintainable.

2:33:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, like for example using...

2:33:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Code localized to where it's used. Like instead of using a utils.ts folder where you dump every single function, keep the functions where they're used. That just makes it more maintainable.

2:33:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like also using JSON in a database versus its own columns. Like these small things, but it's...

2:34:04 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a very small example where it's just something we learn over time. Like if you see someone using a utils function and putting it in its own file, you'd tell them, hey, you're using this twice. Just, I don't know, just kind of put it in the code maybe.

2:34:21 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think those things like Making that bad code into good code isn't more effort though. It's just I have more experience now. The effort was learning.

2:34:36 - Jorge Lewis 
It's all just coming down to experience. Good code, there's no good code or bad code. It's just experienced, like experienced and not experienced.

2:34:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think that's the realization we're coming to.

2:34:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's not that ugly code is good code or beautiful code is good code. It's just, it'll be what you're most experienced with. Like if we told B was to make the most beautiful codes, it wouldn't even be close to what our bad code is, if that makes sense. It's hard to pinpoint the statement, you know.

2:35:18 - Jorge Lewis 
It's I feel like we could make a can we be able to concisely summarize what we have now into probably like three different rules where it's like, okay, yeah, it needs to accomplish the task. But it relies on, like it just there's something we have something here now we have we have like an idea that we're trying to get to which is it all comes down to your experience and it's just there's we've discussed a lot of good things and we just now need to figure out a way to articulate and that's always the hardest part these things, and depending on the context, probably several more not listed here.

2:36:00 - Jonas Lindberg 
If uptime matters a lot to my business, I was asking the same thing.

2:36:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
If you get one week to do something, and you make it one time each day, compared to if you're trying to make the perfect thing over the whole week, which will give the best outcome.

2:36:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, and I was thinking of like could we try the experiment with like our developers to we should we tell them spend three hours Making one code and do that three times versus making one project like we have has nine chin may be west nazif And me five developers. Let's say three make three of them spend one full day making a project and then two of them make three small projects, and then at the end of it, ask them to make a new project. Just the similar study that they did, but with code. I wonder how that would do. But we'd have to do it, it'd have to be in something totally new, like a new language, a new everything, so that everyone is, so that I could obviously, we need to do it at scale probably. Maybe we could try that study out sometime, as just a fun, interesting thing. Cause it's, it's something like that can prove a good point.

2:37:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
The thing about it is. If you did the like projects just quickly once you wouldn't learn error handling, you wouldn't learn type handling. You'd just use any across all of them because you're doing free quick projects. You don't have time to go.

2:37:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So, like I said earlier, when did I learn that?

2:37:43 - Jonas Lindberg 
Because I've always, I've always seen the vector inside of ourselves, which kind of just goes, Hey, this is something that was a good time.

2:37:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:37:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, Junduz has nagged me enough about this. Maybe I should learn this.

2:38:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
But yeah, like what made me nag to you about using any and not nag to you about your horrible file structures, for example?

2:38:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Like, I was trying to pick something that I haven't even gone into. Like, when I look at your code, I just immediately go, bruh, Annie, bruh, horrible error handling. I don't care what the code does. These two things can be improved.

2:38:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it also when I experience the problem of that bad code, like when I'm not logging, typing an error, do I experience the problem that is solved by typing things? That I'm like, oh, typing would solve this.

2:39:03 - Jorge Lewis 
When did I realize types were good? Because before this, before TypeScript, I was, I didn't like types. I liked my Python dynamic types. I was like, huh, statically typed types. Come on.

2:39:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Why would I not want to make my industry when you type like a profile dot and then the whole list of things that could be. Yeah.

2:39:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:39:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

2:39:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Because now I can very clearly explain to someone why I use TypeScript and not, or why I use types and not use types. But it's, I think it's just from experience, but it's, there has to be something that I can say where it's like, because this, so I started using types, like, because I've seen this error. So I started using types, but I don't think there is like, so this is where you tried it out and you liked it.

2:39:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:39:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So this is where it'd be helpful. Just documenting where you just really get to understand what happened in the thought process. So like with starting business, if I wanted to do another one, I would not be able to understand why we, and I learned this thing without documenting it through the process. Like I right now understand why I use types, but I don't understand how I got here.

2:40:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, let's, it's already 3am.

2:40:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Resilience may be a much more important defining characteristic.

2:40:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, I think so. Going over the, there's quite a lot left to go over. If we want to, yeah, if we want to go into like proper conversations, like we have been instead of just speed running the rest, I think it's best with a part two.

2:40:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe we've discussed enough so that I can write a script.

2:40:58 - Jorge Lewis 
It's never going to be perfect. My video that I'm going to publish tomorrow night, I am by no means proud, if anything but

2:41:09 - Jorge Lewis 
of my video I made on Monday and edited it since a couple of days ago. Shots are way overexposed. The frame rates aren't matching.

2:41:26 - Jorge Lewis 
The audio is so terrible. But it's not a matter of making that perfect. It's just I'm going to publish that and publish the next one better than that. So with this video, and I don't know if you've realized this yet, but when you watch your YouTubers, you don't remember their first video. You remember what you're watching now. Um, like your first videos, no one will remember, like your friends and people will remember because like, Oh, you know, or how do I explain it? So I don't want to share this video I'm going to make with my, my friends from high school because they're going to be like, Oh wow, this guy sucks. You know? And At some point, they're not my audience anyways, but at some point, my real audience is never going to see my first few videos. The real people that are going to be watching me every day.

2:42:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
But I think it's important for yourself to upload it still, because then when you publish your next video, who you should be comparing yourself to is yourself.

2:42:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Is that previous video.

2:42:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
Exactly. You shouldn't be comparing yourself to other videos.

2:42:30 - Jorge Lewis 
I take it down when I post a better one.

2:42:33 - Jonas Lindberg 
Don't even take it down, just keep it working up and be able to compare to yourself in the past rather than comparing yourself to other YouTubers.

2:42:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, I mean, just in terms of like more technically, you probably want to archive it or at least private it because just it represents your image.

2:42:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:42:53 - Jonas Lindberg 
Also being able to show yourself improve over time is good though.

2:42:59 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that's done other ways. I don't know. But who cares?

2:43:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
So no one's going to look back at your old ones.

2:43:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So the only person that's going to notice how you improved over time is your long-term fans, which if they're long-term fans, you don't, they don't need the other, the older videos published and yourself and yourself.

2:43:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
People that go, Hmm, I wonder how this guy was in his beginning. And then they can be like, amazing. Like, wow, he, he, he came from this, but what's the term glow up.

2:43:40 - Jorge Lewis 
He glowed up.

2:43:47 - Jorge Lewis 
At the cost of sacrificing your professional or your high quality image though.

2:43:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Does it? I wouldn't see that as a negative.

2:44:02 - Jorge Lewis 
That's interesting, yeah. Like for example one person that I watch when like every video he posts is this guy called Daniel Dallin Which I realized His the person managing his social media like his whole thing Is a person that I watched like for a long long time, and it's this guy. He's like 17 years old He's been doing social media for like a long time And I was like there's no way like it just feels like it's so weird that type of circle But anyways, I need to meet this guy by the way. Let me send you this video or his channel. He lives in Hong Kong And he's the fastest growing entrepreneur right now on YouTube.

2:44:37 - Unidentified Speaker 
Wow.

2:44:37 - Jorge Lewis 
He's about to reach a hundred K.

2:44:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
How do you measure that?

2:44:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, well it's very obvious.

2:44:47 - Jorge Lewis 
He's like his, his, his iconic, um, or, or his thumbnail is iconic. His POV thumbnail.

2:45:01 - Jorge Lewis 
You might have seen it actually around. Yeah, like where he just puts the letters POV in white on his thumbnails. And everyone has been using it.

2:45:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah.

2:45:16 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he lives in Stockholm.

2:45:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are we doing part two later?

2:45:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Part two, if necessary. I'm gonna... See what I can write from all we have here.

2:45:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, we can do like make little, yeah, if you're interested in watching the next of this guy's video, links in the description.

2:45:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Since we ain't finishing it today.

2:45:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So I'm gonna see what I can, I can muster up in a script. If I can explain, I hate making these videos because I want to make it so perfect that I don't want anything to be wrong. Like I don't want to be like, But it's just like things you have to publish.

2:46:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's painfully close to what we've been discussing today. Like the bad code versus good code. You just gotta do it like many times and then that'll be more valuable than doing it once.

2:46:19 - Jorge Lewis 
But perfect. Yeah. Like I can republish, I can remake this video and the third time it'll take me three hours to make rather than 20. That's an exaggeration, but like, because I understand the point of view, like the script's already going to be there. I'm just going to refine it and I'm just going to edit this. I I'm going to, I'm not doing the editing myself, but anyways.

2:46:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

2:46:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. A little B was yeah.

2:46:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah...

2:46:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Is anyone on? Will's been on the whole day today, by the way. Oh, okay. Yeah. Been nice. And I got two updates from him today. That's the most I've ever gotten. Ever.

2:47:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Did you have a talk with him?

2:47:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, no.

2:47:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
No? No?

2:47:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:47:15 - Jorge Lewis 
To do... He added me, but he didn't add me.

2:47:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, he did at Jorge, but it wasn't like my profile.

2:47:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
I guess that's it then. Better get going to sleep.

2:47:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I've been having some crazy dips between, you'll see this in my video tomorrow, I talked about it, between five and seven, which is the time I work out. So I've started doing, which I mean, I have been trying to do this and you probably know from the start, getting back to Hong Kong, I don't want to be waking up as like at 12. I want to be waking up at least at 10. That's already late. Normal people wake up around 8. Exactly. 10 is already like bruh.

2:48:20 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's not only what's the social stigma, but it's like the actual physical things, like your body is already shaking.

2:48:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have to get up at 5.30am to Tuesday.

2:48:37 - Jorge Lewis 
For what?

2:48:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have to go to the DLT and get my printed license. The driver's license. I've only got like temporary papers at the moment.

2:48:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I got a thumbs up from the Huberman. You know Huberman? Andrew Huberman?

2:48:57 - Jorge Lewis 
No.

2:48:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Nay.

2:49:03 - Jonas Lindberg 
Baddest names. It'll be nice to have first driver's license though, in hand. Card I can travel with too. Like I can travel in hand now without passport or everything. Just driver's license.

2:49:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Interesting.

2:49:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:49:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's like a full on like Thai passport basically or passport just for Thailand.

2:49:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That's the Andromeda I sent you in your PM.

2:49:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
I see. The Guardian says wellness bro, which is like the people I, I avoid. So yeah.

2:49:41 - Jorge Lewis 
No, he, he is the only wellness bro I will listen to. Oh my mama.

2:49:48 - Jorge Lewis 
This guy's a, he's a goat. I mean, you know, Lex Freeman, right?

2:49:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
No.

2:50:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, bro.

2:50:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, yeah, I do. I got it in three years.

2:50:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, man, this this Andrew human is like the he has this podcast of relating to health. I watched like three episodes back like a few years ago. I'm just not a big podcast guy. I don't know.

2:50:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, his content is great. But anyways, I watched a summary video made by this third party dude. And it was, he said, at least sleep well for 80% of your nights. And for the rest of the nights, at least have a good reason.

2:50:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Because before, I would stress so much about getting my sleep every single night that it would make my sleep actually worse. And it would make me just like not... Live happily. So now that he said at least 80% of your life, I can spend one night a week with bad sleep and at least I'll be okay.

2:50:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe, but it's like, if you listen to the doctors, they say, like, one hour miss takes, or what is it? Yeah, one hour miss takes seven days to get back. He is the doctor.

2:51:11 - Jorge Lewis 
He's the, one of the leading guys on the whole, well, besides Matthew Walker, on like the whole sleep thing.

2:51:20 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay.

2:51:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
So are you supposed to wake up at the same time the next day just for less hours or? I don't know.

2:51:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's just the most realistic thing to do. Like not stress. Like 80% one day a week is pretty realistic. Like that's like, Oh, you're going out with your friends or you're just, that's pretty realistic. Like one day you have, you sleep two hours later. I don't know. Just.

2:51:52 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'd like to know if I should wake up the same time or if I should wake up two hours later.

2:51:59 - Jorge Lewis 
That's what I've wondered. So tonight, should I wake up later and then the next day you you Like, the normal time? Or should I wake up at the same time and cut the sleep?

2:52:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, which one's better?

2:52:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, because I've always heard that you should always wake up at the same time when you go to bed, can vary, but always wake up at the same time. That's what I've heard. Your like mind clock singles in on that time no matter when you go to sleep your mind will just wake you up at the correct time and that's how you're supposed to work.

2:52:34 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll send you the video I watched it was like a very concise I think it was four minute or I mean I put on what speed but it was just yeah the wake-up time is the most important but I have another question is Does your wake up time also depend on like a 90 minute cycle? Like, can I move it around within maybe not 90 minutes? I think, I don't think so, but like 20 minutes, like a 30 minutes.

2:52:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
It is the 90-minute cycle, but from my experience, before I was obsessed about the 90-minute cycle, I always changed my alarm to match with when I went to sleep plus 30 minutes. But what I realized was that when I set my alarm to the same time every morning, no matter what part of the cycle I'm in, my body just goes, well, that's it. I wake up consistently like 20 minutes before my alarm.

2:53:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll send you the video I watched. It has a good explanation. Each of your cells has its own timer. It's interesting. I want to I mean, I'll probably end up waking up later than usual. But just so you know, for most days, I probably want to be waking up at least at 10. I want to see with Chinmay if we can schedule times throughout the day to catch up so I can wake up at maybe nine.

2:53:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
But yeah.

2:53:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, what do you think about when your body just naturally wakes up consistently, like 15, 20 minutes before you're alone?

2:53:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I haven't gotten, some days I, I usually never wake up before my alarm or if I do, I force myself back to sleep. But since I've gotten back to Hong Kong, I've done that like a couple of times and that's like super shocking to me. I'm like, wait a minute, what? Like I just, I just, I woke up and I felt rested and I was like, wait, what time is it? Yeah, I'm 30 minutes before. All right, let's just start the day. Usually I'm like, no, I need my sleep. And I go back to sleep. Like, but it's just, Yeah. See, that's the problem where I get where it's just like, I need, I need the sleep. And then you, you just.

2:54:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
I've heard of it. Like when you, when you wake up and it's like less than an hour before your alarm, you should just get up because it's. Yeah.

2:54:46 - Jorge Lewis 
But I don't have my alarm or my phone next to my, or a clock next to my bed. So I have to wake up to stand up and that's already got me woken up. So I usually just, if I wake up before, I'm like, no, it's not time. Go back to sleep. I should probably fix that. Bro, I can't wait for my optic fiber. A thousand megabits per second. Inshallah. I could go to 2,500. You're like about to maybe move out the second you get there.

2:55:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I could stay here for as long as I want, I think. So, well, maybe not as long as I want, but at least for a little bit. Like, even if your parents leave?

2:55:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
You just keep the house warm?

2:55:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, they'd probably let me stay here for like a month. And then they'd be like, okay, we need to start pulling some rent from it.

2:55:42 - Jorge Lewis 
But even then, the next two weeks, or like, they're going to decide, I think, in two weeks. So I'll have like a month, if they're going to be here for a month. So I'll have at least a month of just, a gigabyte per second speed. Oh man.

2:55:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's never truly one gigabyte. It's like slightly lower always.

2:56:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. But like comparing that to my 20 megabits per second download and my 0.5 megabits upload. I felt like that.

2:56:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
This is so bad in Hong Kong.

2:56:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's no, it's cause I'm using 5g and it's like, We're just, we're, we have trees next to me. So it's like, it's not like it's reaching anything.

2:56:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, but how is there no fiber in the whole thing? Like your pipe looks like Thailand, right? Like, or it looks like Southeast Asia.

2:56:32 - Jorge Lewis 
It does. The optic fiber is running through the the telephone poles and it just took them so long to do it because They were just lazy like the company was just lazy. They were like Seeds because it's their their offices aren't where we are. So they have to send someone out and do it But now enough people called them saying hey, we need optic fiber. We need cable. Oh So now our entire village, if you pay attention, there's cables running everywhere and it looks so bad if you notice.

2:57:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's the same thing here in Thailand. There's all like thousands of cables.

2:57:14 - Jorge Lewis 
But those are power cables. Isn't that even uglier? That's worse, that's worse.

2:57:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But I guess Thailand is like the third world, so Hong Kong is one of the richest cities in the world.

2:57:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is your village, like, does it even compare to how rich the actual city is?

2:57:36 - Jorge Lewis 
The real estate, no. The people, yes. Because it's the most quiet area. Where do rich retired people want to go? Not the city.

2:57:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
Fair enough. But the real estate, how's it?

2:57:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cheap?

2:57:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it's about like 1.2 per house mill. And then like, uh, 4,500 month rent for our house. That's what we'd be listing it at.

2:58:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's 4,000. Okay.

2:58:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I heard 450 when I was like, Look what I got got my little I actually got all my equipment sent from Amazon a couple days ago got my light Just charging now this tripod. It's a beast What else that's it?

2:58:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Why would you want it to bend that much? Like I feel like from tripod, I'd want it to not bend that much so that I know it's like correct. Does that make sense? If it bends that much, I'm relying on my, me, myself getting it level.

2:58:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so for example, if I want to hook it up on those bars up here, I can like wrap it around and then get a nice aerial view. Or if I want to hook it up to my monitor up top, like I just literally just bang.

2:59:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's just up, you can like hook it.

2:59:09 - Jorge Lewis 
That's the benefit. Yeah. Like, like it's just there already, like done. And then I can fine tune it on my phone. I have the grid lines and like the, what do you call it? Like the things that tell me if it's aligned or not.

2:59:25 - Jorge Lewis 
But like it's just it's just and and I can use it as like a stick as well or what do you call it? Selfie stick just bang I Do have normal tripods as well. I've got the full-size one here These are all from like before by the way, they're just sitting in the house and I have this from Antopia this trusty boy I Think that one's made its debut already a couple of times on my channel I But this thing I'm in love like it's just I slot my phone in and then although I'm this was a bad idea. My phone has MagSafe which it's a magnet so it sticks instead of this annoying thing where I have to put it in.

3:00:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways.

3:00:10 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah. Guess that's it though. Gotta get out of this thing.

3:00:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes sir. Our whole team is going to be on tomorrow and we're going to be like helping out like three in the afternoon. Hey good morning guys.

3:00:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, it ain't too late for me. I'm like, gonna be an hour late to sleep.

3:00:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'm already too...

3:00:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
probably gonna be. If we think about it in UTC though, we both should be waking up around the same time. Because we're going to sleep at the same time.

3:00:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wow.

3:00:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Look at the white balancing it does on my face.

3:00:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

3:00:54 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, wow. Yeah, you just got more information.

3:00:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Wow, that's very impressive. I'm learning all about this thing on my phone. I've got the Blackmagic cam app.

3:01:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Man, this camera, I'm just... Every time I think about that this was worth $1,300, I'm like, wow. But then I realized how much value I've gotten out of it with just work and everything. It's like, yes, that's worth it. And soon, in a month or two, they'll release their AI features, and I'll be able to use them on this phone. All right, let's go get our PC. I'll see you later. Thanks for your time. See you later. Bye. Bye-bye.""","Meet Meeting Transcript (8).txt"

Sat, Aug 17, 2024

2:07 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, Jorge, basically just to run you down on what he's said until now is that he's looking to resign at the other job in conclusion, and that he wants to move over to ours in full time, but he hasn't had the opportunity.

2:26 - Jonas Lindberg 
That's the gist of it.

2:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, he's not here yet. Yeah, he's currently trying to join.

2:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
And then he started kind of telling the story from the moment he got the Uber job and was going over it, but then his connection just died at the same time as he was starting. So it's good that you joined so that you can also get the story.

3:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Will, can you join Google Meet?

3:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Already joining? OK.

3:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, hello.

3:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Hey, how are you? No, the connection seems to be bad. The one on gather was just bad.

3:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll be turning off my gather for now.

3:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, go ahead.

3:51 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, you were starting to go through the story. Do you want to just summarize what you've said already to me for Jorge, so that he has the context?

4:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

4:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I'll be turning off my camera too, if it's okay, for internet.

4:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
The internet seems to be fine, huh?

4:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh, okay.

4:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In which case, just a short summary. I got accepted at this server admin job in around May, and then Jorge contacted me around June, which I was actually not able to respond because I got kidney stones during the first days, but my initial plan back then was to work at Stardino during the times that I'm also working at this other company. I kept it as a secret because In our local culture, working two jobs is often times from the pot, by the employer.

5:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So that's primarily the reason why I kept it as a secret.

5:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, that's where I left off.

5:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
We're already going to be discussing the ways forward, like the schedules.

5:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is it right, Jonas? Yeah.

5:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
You also mentioned that you were planning to resign at the auto company, right?

5:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh yeah, absolutely.

5:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm gonna send the resignation paper either next week, Monday, or next week, Tuesday.

5:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

5:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
One of the main issues that we've had with your time here at Cirquino has just been your presence, even during your work hours. You've just seemed like you've been on a different wavelength, like in meetings, you're tired, closing your eyes all the time. Just seemed like you're about to sleep and otherwise just haven't been fully present, if that makes sense.

6:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think I've been called out about it a few times already. I'm pretty aware. And probably it's because of the overwork too. But then again, it kind of feels like I'm saying an excuse. So the way I move forward with it is probably to create a means for me to read the messages better and also connect with the other developers more often.

7:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's possibly my way forward.

7:24 - Jonas Lindberg 
Personally, I feel like it's just kind of been the whole situation that's created the circumstances. If you're, as I explained earlier in Gather, if you're working from 7 a.m. In the morning till 9 p.m. In the evening every single weekday, there's no way all of those work hours will be efficient, you're going to be super tired. If you want any free time to spend in your weekdays, then you're going to be either missing hours or missing sleep. And if you're missing sleep on such a schedule where you're working every single hour of the day, you're not going to be working efficiently at all. I think that's the reason why you haven't been present fully.

8:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, other than that, I think one of my issues is I oftentimes lose track if I'm not writing notes of the meetings. That's a habit that I know works, but I don't strictly implement it.

8:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes, what?

8:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Write down notes, like notes of the meeting.

9:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I don't think there's any specific thing like that that's been ditched.

9:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
What do you think, Jorge?

9:11 - Jorge Lewis 
It's like, it's hard to tell because Any behavior that we experienced from you was affected by your other job. So it's like, I can't say, oh, it's this. Oh, no, it's this. Because everything, oh, it's this, we could say it was because of that, but we don't know. So for all I know, my concern is that you leave this other job and you join us full time, and some of those issues still remain. And then we can say, oh, it wasn't because of the other job. It was because of something else.

9:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, good point.

10:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

10:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to think about it.

10:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, it's a bit hard.

10:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I hear what you're saying. It's a bit hard. For us to figure out what's going on or I guess for the both of you to figure out what's going on to see which ones are an issue related to the other company and which ones are just literally behavior related issues.

10:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would argue the other company plays a huge role especially with my activity in from morning to afternoon, not being able to respond to calls, not being able to be up on gather, those things are related to the other companies. However, like the times where I sometimes, I sometimes don't, like, fall too much attention to meetings, like I'm a bit, how do I say it properly, like, lightheaded? Is lightheaded a term?

11:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay.

11:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would argue that even though the other company might play a role there, with all the stress and all the stuff, I'm sensing that it's related to a behavioral tendency of mine to be a little bit lightheaded if I'm not writing down notes. Because this is a behavior I've observed for a long time already.

11:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Are you guys waiting for me or something?

12:08 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

12:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm just thinking.

12:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Everyone's like thinking. Yeah.

12:22 - Jonas Lindberg 
Something you learn doing a lot of meetings is just being comfortable with silence.

12:26 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you think, Jorge?

12:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What are your takeaways?

12:47 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it'll be a great opportunity for you to grow as a developer, but there's also a risk that in the end it doesn't work out with us and then you'd be left in a bad spot. That's one of my concerns.

13:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
That's fair.

13:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think maybe it's because I'm overconfident in myself, but I honestly think I have the capacity to be hired in another job if everything goes wrong like I'm not that afraid of losing wait wait that sounds wrong I'm not afraid to lose no 30 um I'm not afraid of that prospect because I think it's easy for someone like me to be hired in a simple job like a simple server management a simple network like I'm not afraid of

13:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
losing your house or something.

13:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Basically.

13:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If all else fails, I can always be a fryer at McDonald's.

14:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
That is the way.

14:12 - Jonas Lindberg 
What we really need from people in Startino is a lot of self-initiative, a lot of wanting to move forward.

14:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
taking on responsibility and not relying on others, and I think if you're consumed with another job in addition to this job, and you're trying to optimise your time too much, what happens is you don't have the opportunity to have that self-initiative to over-deliver to take on responsibility to manage yourself, you end up just completing the things that are handed to you, and just that, and it's not in a proper timeframe either.

14:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
As an example, Chen Mei, especially when he started with us, when we got him on, like, and gave him a task. Usually he did the task and then over-delivered on it, looked into new avenues he suggested we go into, like, did a lot for us beyond just the task that we gave him. And that's only something that's possible to do if you have the time to do it. And if you have the mind space to go properly into it, you can't really get into that mind space if you're working a 18 day onto different things.

16:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Seems like well cut out again.

16:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe you can turn off your camera, we'll see if that helps.

17:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, hey, this might be.

18:01 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, the only thing I think is just, if he leaves his other job, there's a chance that he doesn't fit in here, and then he's going to have to find another job.

18:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he didn't seem too concerned over that, so I wouldn't feel that responsibility on my shoulders at least.

18:27 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, joined with the work account now, I think.

18:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, maybe using my phone will be a bit better.

18:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
It's sideways for me, but it's clear.

18:44 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, OK.

18:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So yeah, anything that you guys discussed without me?

18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Just to highlight it again, my concern is that we don't want the responsibility or the weight of having to keep you because you have no other job or because you left your other job for 13-0.

19:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
How do I say this?

19:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's not really that bad.

19:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, okay.

19:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here's how I think about the situation. Right now, I have a very... I basically have two options.

19:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I could probably focus more on Stardino.

20:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's a very simple job with not a lot of things to do. But my... But growth there is also minimal. Or I can focus on...

20:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I can focus on Startino, which I honestly believe would be a lot more stressful, but would force me to grow in ways I don't know. I could. I could possibly choose the other job for the sake of stability and some of the government benefits, but I honestly feel like five years down the line with them, or a year down the line with them, I would regret not taking this option because I won't grow as much. You feel me?

21:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And if, let's say, let's say, in a hypothetical universe that I actually don't align with the values in Startino, it's part of the business. At some point, at some point, yeah, there will be major differences that should be resolved immediately.

21:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There's nothing wrong about it, Para. Sorry, Filipino word, Para. Like, it's part of the game.

21:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, sorry if I keep putting in Filipino words.

21:40 - Jonas Lindberg 
Only I will understand them. Yeah.

21:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
But basically, my stance is that I would prioritize Tartino mainly because I feel like I would be growing much better as a developer than stay at a typical server management job in a small company in Makati.

22:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah I resonate with that.

22:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
What about you Jorge?

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah I mean I think that's obvious, that's pretty obvious. Yeah.

22:32 - Jonas Lindberg 
Jorge do you want to hop in another call and just discuss them or want to remain here?

22:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is in Will's court now.

22:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

22:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's basically my court because... I have to make a choice? It's up to you. It's your decision.

22:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, I'm not gonna lie, guys, but like...

23:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although it's in my court, yeah, my decision is to be with Startino. Like, you guys still have the final say. Like, whatever your decision is, I have to respect it. No, not have. I will respect it.

23:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nonetheless.

23:24 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we don't have much of a decision right now. As you know, we're open for you to join full-time. That's how it was initially. So if you're able to actually be on full-time this time, then yeah, that's the way we would like to go and then see from there.

23:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Although, I have a small request, Jorge, if ever I get full-time.

23:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I want to keep the up work, just lower my rate a little bit and to the proper amount of hours. I just realized how much it benefits me by letting me know how much I work for the day and how much hours I'm not actually doing productive things.

24:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, sure.

24:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's not a problem.

24:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I think we're pretty cool on that front.

24:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Would you like, Jonas, to have a little bit longer talk? I mean, a little bit longer coding session on Sunday to compensate the lack of coding we've done for today?

24:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, sure.

24:41 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can do it on Sunday instead.

24:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

24:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I was supposed to see Chinmay today, but he's not here.

24:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, he's usually not on when you have scheduled pair programming with him.

24:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
I see, like, Jorge is supposed to be pair programming with him. Oh, he's not on.

25:01 - Jorge Lewis 
To be fair, I hopped on, like, as it was supposed to start, because I didn't get a notification for this event. So I don't know. He hasn't put a thumbs up, so I think that's why. Yeah.

25:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
By the way, is it possible to move the Startino YouTube discussion, like, well, little bit earlier because it's like I prefer to go out for lunch like and it's currently like the right between over nothing that so it's like too early to go now and also it's too close but it's also very late to go oh we could do it later as well if it's Is everyone invited there or is it just the two of you?

25:45 - Jonas Lindberg 
We can just do it at that time.

25:46 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll just take lunch at like 2pm then, I guess.

25:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know why I'm feeling so tired. I think it's because of the rain. It's been really rainy the past few days. So I'm going to go shower and then...

26:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
Maybe we can do it tomorrow?

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Ideally, I don't want to push it back anymore because it's already been quite a while. It's just a discussion. It's like, uh, it can, it can even be like, I mean, it'd probably be like an hour or maybe probably an hour and a half, the whole thing. We can just do it right now.

26:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't have enough energy for it. So if you want, you're on in the evening. Uh, yeah.

26:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think so, yeah. It's just that I'm not very awake during the evenings now because my sleep schedule was thrown back and forth.

26:42 - Jorge Lewis 
After lunch work then?

26:50 - Jonas Lindberg 
Tomorrow morning I would. Today evening should work.

26:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
We can do after lunch as well.

27:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
I just like to get some programming done then when I'm like awake or so.

27:11 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, we could do tomorrow afternoon like, but like one.

27:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
What's that? So, so like 12.

27:21 - Jorge Lewis 
What time is your lunch on Sundays?

27:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Usually just go out like between 12 and or like 12. Yeah.

27:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
12 to 1.

27:34 - Jonas Lindberg 
Usually I'm done with lunch right before stand-up.

27:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's do tomorrow at like 1 your time then, or 1.30ish.

27:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

27:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll move it.

27:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sounds good.

27:48 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll accept it. I'll accept the move. I wonder if Chinmay's gonna get in.

27:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, who put Balloon on my desk?

28:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh that wasn't you?

28:01 - Jonas Lindberg 
I thought it was you.

28:03 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I don't want balloons on my desk. 100% that was Beelze.

28:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Who had the time to put 4 balloons on my desk?

28:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Which one's Beelze's desk? Oh yeah this one.

28:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, I tried to reschedule, what happened to it?

28:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Ah, okay, yeah.

28:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, okay, it's rescheduled now, then you get the notification.

28:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
It never asked me if I wanted to send or update it for other...

28:57 - Jorge Lewis 
I haven't gotten a notification, but...

28:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Copy to Jorge, say. For me it's still 1.30. Oh, I just added it to yours. And then...

29:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, now if you look at Sunday 18th, it should be there. 1 to 2 PM for me.

29:19 - Jonas Lindberg 
I think, yeah. 2 to 3.

29:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Guys, is it okay if I early?

29:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
If you what? If I go early?

29:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sure.

29:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Since I think I'm okay already. Do you guys have any questions for me or something?

29:38 - Jorge Lewis 
No, just whenever you can, posting an update about the signup would be good.

29:43 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, okay, wait, wait, wait.

29:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Good thing you brought that up.

29:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
With regards to the updates, I saw your announcement a while ago, but Are you expecting, like...

30:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Ah, okay, okay.

30:06 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In the channel user sign-up, do you have an expectation for me to provide an explanation still on what's happening on the auth?

30:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Because my initial assumption is that my updates are to be written in status, in the status subchannels.

30:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

30:31 - Jonas Lindberg 
In coordination with Chenmei.

30:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

30:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So put it from our perspective you're working for two days. I have no clue what you're actually developing I can hop in a call Which is which is what I do like here and there but kind of to put like as a baseline It would be good for everybody to be posting what they're working on and like in the technical channel so that I don't have to support them. For example, what I can do is I can spend a 10-minute checkup on everybody twice a day to gather the technical things, what's going on, are they doing the right solution, but then multiply that by three people and that's already a lot of time.

31:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In the Adaptive, I update what I'm working on and the status, I update what's the status for the feature I'm working on. Is that right?

31:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the features that are going to be deployed. It doesn't matter who's working on it.

31:29 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just what doesn't have to be crafted for current at all. It shouldn't be the problem. The reason has expected it to be is because you've also are us and everyone has been asking questions in the dev channel. We shouldn't be asking him anything in the dev channel. That's just for us. It's supposed to be showing him, Hey, we're working. Look at us. We're chatting. That's basically it. Yeah.

31:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Otherwise, what's in the status channel should be outcome focused. That should be what he can expect when. And it's to set expectations for him so that he knows what to expect when. It's not for him to put pressure on us or anything like that. It's just showing him when he should expect pain.

32:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think that's better.

32:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So basically, from what I'm hearing, we have to post two kinds of updates. One update, what we're working on. Second update, what's the status of the features assigned to us.

32:38 - Jonas Lindberg 
That update is for Jorge. Status updates are for Q&A.

32:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Got it.

32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Jorge plus the rest of the team, because like, for example, Chinmay has no clue what you're working on for the signup page, but it would be helpful for him to know. Oh, he's working on the signup page. So when he's done with that, we could hook it up to the whole chat. Like it's just that type of communication is just needed for projects. Kuin sent a message to me in a private chat saying you guys have no overlap between your call times. I put call in bracket because I'm available like 12 hours a day so I just put the times that Kuin can reliably call me. I don't know what your guys' times are. Yeah, wait, let me see.

33:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If I remember correctly, we don't have a lot of overlapping hours too.

33:28 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have on my calendar when I can be called there's like book a meeting entries which is 11 a.m. To 4 p.m. Is when you can book and then 11 the night to 2 a.m.

33:49 - Jonas Lindberg 
That should be very clear there when you can book with me.

33:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean I didn't respond to him just because like he doesn't need like that is a worry but I'm just gonna tell him, oh, those are the call times. Like for you. I don't know. But it's just like, because we do have enough overlap. Chinmain has nine, have at least like a couple of hours a day.

34:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just show him a screenshot of like your calendar with all the pair of homecomings and meetings between us and say, we meet. We meet each other. So it's just, um, Yeah.

34:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So when do you think you're, let us, I don't want to force you into a final decision now, but when do you think you would have an answer by?

34:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, I don't think I heard this properly. You asked me when signup is ready, right? Or when am I able to be full-time in Startino?

34:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
The latter. Okay. Yeah.

34:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll probably provide you with a definite answer on Tuesday.

35:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Tuesday. Okay.

35:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then Tuesday, you'll let us know. And then from there, if you are going full-time, when could we expect that?

35:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

35:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So in typical Filipino companies, resignation happens on a 30-day basis. So you have to render 30 days of service.

35:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
However, I can negotiate.

35:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll probably try to negotiate it to be shorter because that's also possible to be done.

35:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool. Sounds good.

35:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, keep us updated.

35:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, sure thing.

35:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right, cool.

35:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Great chat, guys. Jonas, good luck coding, and I'll be back on in like 20 minutes. I'll let you know if you're going for lunch then. I mean, yeah, we'll... Have a nice day, guys.

35:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye-bye. See you.

35:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye-bye.

35:55 - Jonas Lindberg 
At least on his phone.

35:57 - Jonas Lindberg 
Oh, on his phone.

36:00 - Jonas Lindberg

Fri, Jul 5, 2024

0:03 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Whenever you're starting a new channel, that channel has the purpose of serving one particular type of audience. They should be going there to get a specific format, a specific length of video, a specific theme. Like, if you can tailor it as much as possible, then you will have a more loyal audience. Sure, it may not be as large initially, but you will develop a more loyal following. So something that jumped out of me while I was going through the, like, audiences section that you put on there was that these are, like, from what I surmised, they were generally, like, some topic ideas. What you were talking about mainly was here. Though who the age of 25 to 55 startup founders looking to establish a software business that works Functionally great and all but something is that the age range is a bit too wide Like I want to give you my thoughts before you kind of go into it and show Oh, no, you can interrupt me at any time. It's just a discussion.

1:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I can kind of give you the vision and what I'm trying to achieve with it, in my own words. I know maybe some stuff should add, but yeah. I'm really trying to start a brand, a personal brand, for a couple of reasons. The business reason isn't as prominent yet, I feel like, Regardless, if I target it towards the ICP of my business, I think it'll provide value because they'll be, they do background searches as I'm very aware of, and they usually find all my social media, but they're able to see that and see that I post really high content stuff. I'm an honest person, I have experience, but I think I'll be able to target the people I want to, which are developers and young entrepreneurs, while still providing value to my business ICP. And maybe later down the road, I can produce some tailored content specifically towards that.

2:01 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah, that's actually a very good point that you brought up because the reason that you just said is something that actually happens with me in multiple times. A lot of the really high quality clients that I got up to this point were mainly people that had seen my content before or had seen me putting out content and establishing myself as like a brand and a figure that is present on the internet. And they listed that as one of the reasons when I asked for feedback. So like, for example, here.

2:27 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, the main reason was because if a video editor is starting his own channel, it's very appealing to me because then he'll understand more of what a video should be rather than just making it look fancy. I could have gone on Upwork or Fiverr and hired someone very cheap for there, but then I just know the quality wouldn't be as good and I'd get a much more holistic value for my money with you.

2:56 - Abdallah Ahmed 
I appreciate that a lot. And I want to touch on a point really quickly. If we're talking about the technical side, if you know exactly what you want to do, then Fiverr is going to be a very good option. But they won't have as much of the holistic brand building and channel direction and strategizing. The fifth That's the exact same reason that I started my YouTube channel for myself It's like how can you like help someone else on their channel and say that's your video editor when you have nothing behind your own self like that For example, this is a message that I screenshot it from one of my clients that those were the two reasons that they listed to your own video channel in the channel where you mentioned you earned your first 50 bucks it made it seem more personable and And it also felt like this guy goes above and beyond. Okay, let me just dismiss this. So like what you said earlier, this perfectly like shows that it does work. This is like, it has value beyond the intangible.

4:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Another one that's, I'm just kind of throwing things at everybody. Another idea is also that like, there is more collateral. I think that's always kind of in the back of our heads when we work with you. It's like, he has a YouTube channel. If he doesn't do a good job, then it'll be harmful to his own, his uh, his separate... Sorry, can you repeat that? Can you repeat that part again?

4:35 - Abdallah Ahmed 
There's a lot of echo that's going on and I don't know where it's from

4:44 - Abdallah Ahmed 
It's like I hear your voice and I hear it like, again, but a model of a feel to it.

4:53 - Abdallah Ahmed 
And now I can't hear you at all.

6:04 - Abdallah Ahmed 
I can't hear you. I don't know if you're trying to say something.

8:29 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Alright then, yeah, I was going to suggest that. So, anytime, just type into it and I'll respond. Okay, what were we talking about?

8:43 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Okay, let's just, yeah. Okay, so let's just finish what we were talking about.

8:53 - Abdallah Ahmed 
So the avatar.

8:56 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah, I think this age range is a bit too wide because you know that like the idea of if you're trying to serve everyone, you can't serve anyone. And if you're trying to make everyone happy, you can't make anyone happy. It's the same point. Like the humor of a 25-year-old will be vastly different to one that is 55 years old. The things they like, the things they'll be interested in, all of that. So my point is that the earlier on we are, the more important it is to kind of niche down a bit, as much as we possibly can, while attracting a big enough audience for what we're trying to do. You mentioned that, OK, so Which is the principal reason for you said that there is a business reason to it, but it's not the most prominent of them. Like what is your most singular important goal with the channel? Because there are two ways we can go about this. Like you can maximize for views, but it will be kind of diluted and vague a bit. Or you can go really central towards the specific audience that you're trying to get and you will be able to attract them. Same as how, like I just have 50 subscribers, but this call ended up happening. And those are the kind of two directions that you can go with it. You can go with a medium. But the thing is, the more you niche down, the slower the growth will be. And the more wide you go, there will be more viewers, but they won't be as valuable, depending on what your goal is, because maybe you're just trying to go for name and brand awareness. So just having eyeballs on what you're doing is more important. Maybe you're trying to drive sales and drive like clients to the software business and that's when it's more important to kind of niche down towards those specific people because I've seen some cases where people just have an Incredibly low amount of subscribers and general traction, but they're making absurd numbers So it all depends on what what your goals are going with this channel so that's like the first thing that I'm trying to ask about because that will Everything else will be downstream of it Yeah, like there are some channels that have incredibly low number of subscribers like absolute wise but they're able to make bank because the audience that they do have is very Yeah, there can be enough a very low absolute numbers wise but they're able to drive a lot of sales so it makes it a very profitable business with like less than 10,000 subscribers and you may have like hundred thousand plus and they're barely making any money so that's why I'm trying to discern the most important goal for you whether it's to kind of attract clients or it's more towards general like people knowing of your existence sort of thing it's also different if you're trying to go for yourself or for the channel as a brand so more for yourself not a very business side Yeah, okay, that's fantastic. That works phenomenally well. There are no issues with that. Yeah, okay, that's definitely something that we can do. There are a couple of caveats that I want to point out is that the more you try to center the channel around yourself as a person and your personality and your own existence, the slower it will be to growth

12:47 - Abdallah Ahmed 
there is nothing centered around, you get what I mean? Like there are no symbols, there is no fame and popularity that you can extract attention from them onto yourself. As if, to contrast that to maybe something like a gaming channel that's riding off the trend of a Red Dead Redemption 2, something like that. There is already inherent Inherit interest and liking in that game, so they will naturally be easier for them to attract more viewers But if you're trying to base it on someone that just popped out into the internet without any backing behind them, then it will take longer. It will be more difficult. The growth will be slower. But as I said, take this as a general rule, but the slower the climb, the more loyal and the more long-lasting the audience typically is. And the second part of that is also when it comes to, like, the format of the content itself that you're creating. Because say, for example, that's actually a good point to hit on right now.

13:50 - Abdallah Ahmed 
As I said, I watched through a bunch of the videos of the three channels that you mentioned about.

13:57 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Where were they? Ah, here. Daniel Dallin, No Boilerplate, and Trey Gustafson.

14:04 - Abdallah Ahmed 
All of them have their specific appeal that appeals to their audience based on the format of the content that they created for themselves. No Boilerplate is just audio. It's basically like advanced slides as the form of video. It's mostly technical content about coding, Rust, and that type of thing. And it very rarely veers off of that direction. And because of that, you can see it on their channel.

14:35 - Abdallah Ahmed 
is like It's very difficult to see numbers that are extremely below the number of subscribers like here. It's 278 92 95 Like like every once in a while what like, okay, that's a good point. See this when you podcast a phosphine catalog It's something completely different than what the other that audience is expecting Like here this video where for a channel that's talking about rust and coding and development and getting stuff done and You see those 7.5. Those are like the really dedicated Section segment of the of his audience that is just diehard watch anything he does and follow anything he does Every once in a while doing this is fine, but if you keep on continuously doing that you get cases like this I actually got this specifically for us and for this time, where this is one of the channels that I'm working on currently they had a problem where they had they were posting a couple of shorts that went really viral and it got them a lot of subscribers but now this like this is like recent content they published this is the views and this is the likes if we take this as just like a percentage of the overall subscribers, it's like not even comparable because this is also a reason why I really don't like shorts if you're trying to mix them on a long-form channel because it's a very vastly different audience with very different viewing habits and also another thing is that it's like It's not the type of videos and the type of content that they wanted and that they expected from the channel. So that's like, maybe like 29,000 of those aren't functionally there. They basically don't exist. And the more videos that you put out that are similar to what we just saw here, uh, where was it?

16:47 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Oh, yeah. And the more this happens and you find more and more people just completely abandoning the channel, not watching it anymore.

16:57 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Another thing you see is that when your channel is typically... How do I say this?

17:04 - Abdallah Ahmed 
It's also like the consistency with the format thing, but the more it is based on you, like the part that we said earlier about having a loyal audience, the more it is based around you, like what you as a person are, what you yourself do, the more consistent the views are, as like a proportion to the subscriber count like here it's maybe 46 like as an average 30% to 40% of his audience always consistently watches stuff and that's how you like bring on a loyal audience giving them the same thing at a very consistent time what they were expecting without any major deviations and that's why like you're trying to make it as consistent and as same uniform all the way as possible.

17:53 - Abdallah Ahmed 
And that's also like one of the things that I wanted to bring up is I want us to hone in a lot more on what kind of thing you may have in mind. At the start, you can experiment as much as you want. From what I understand, because you listed those three channels, that's the type of general content that you interact with and that you watch consistently. Travel, talking head about self-improvement, productivity, coding-related stuff.

18:23 - Abdallah Ahmed 
So the thing that we are likely to do, it depends on what your long-term vision are and how slow slash how instant you're trying to get to the results because what I would recommend from a long-term perspective is that you Like, spend a few videos at first just trying to get a feel for things, trying to understand what type of content you enjoy personally making. Because maybe you like talking to a camera just straight head-on and just talking about stuff, like the Trey Gustafson style. Maybe you really like talking about technical content. Maybe you just enjoy the traveling part and just want to shoot a lot of B-roll while hanging out with friends and I could just edit that B-roll into one coherent story.

19:10 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Why? Because the more you enjoy the content that you're making, the more long-term you will be able to make it consistently and keep the rate of your growth without any major interruptions. Because when it comes to YouTube, the growth tends to be pretty, like, exponential. Like, the time from 0 to 100 subscribers tends to be, like, the hardest period of it. Maybe that gap will take you a year, then from 100 to 200, it could take you three, four months, then 500, it could take another two months. It kind of snowballs onto itself because one, the algorithm as a system can... Okay, so do you understand how the algorithm works in general or should I just dive into that part?

20:02 - Abdallah Ahmed 
All right, well, I'll just give a quick nutshell. Basically, YouTube has a general viewer profile of every person that uses their platform. What kind of videos they watch, what kind of videos that they like, comment on, engage with, et cetera, et cetera.

20:17 - Abdallah Ahmed 
What's this?

20:23 - Abdallah Ahmed 
I have no idea what's that. Oh, OK. So you have some experience. I didn't hear about that. That's pretty good, actually. Like, that's very helpful for what we're trying to do here. That's great, dude.

20:39 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Why'd you stop it?

20:50 - Abdallah Ahmed 
I had an end channel back in my day. It was a passion thing. Yeah, like, it seems you were on the up and coming. Why'd you stop? What happened? Did you just lose the passion for it?

21:03 - Abdallah Ahmed 
I see. Okay. So like that kind of ties into what we're talking to, what we were talking about.

21:10 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah. You stop the passion for it. Like, um, yeah. Your uploads kind of became less and less common. Five years, four, then three, then nothing. They completely die that. Okay. So yeah. So that ties into what we're talking about. The more enjoyable, the more enjoyable it is for a process for you. The longer you can keep on it and see those gains come to happen. Because the hardest part is always the beginning, in any kind of skill, in any kind of improvement that you're trying to do. Like, the initial parts suck, but it gets a lot easier for a couple of reasons. One, you understand the skill better and you're way better at it, so it doesn't take you as much effort. Two, people generally enjoy what they're good at a lot more. So when you start to get good at it, you tend to enjoy it a lot more. So that's why I'm like I'm leading with that because we're trying to find what's most enjoyable for you so that you can keep doing it without okay you're signaling to the guy yeah so that you can keep consistent with it without having that much friction against it because if that happens then well you're seeing the channel this is just gonna be a repeat of it The main thing, generally, that we're going to have to be focusing on is your own, like, on-camera presence. Because I can create the thumbnail. I can come up with the ideas. I can edit the video. I can publish it for you. But I can't record it for you in person. So your main priority will have to be, like, getting comfortable with the camera being on you. This would be good if it kind of shows your face, but it doesn't seem like it did.

22:55 - Abdallah Ahmed 
So yeah, so that's like the most principle thing that we're gonna have to be working on. So just, there are a couple of ways to get around, like blitz through it so you can just get comfortable quickly. It's not only just as pain, I know how painful this is gonna sound, but it's just basically recording yourself talking about something, watching it back, and comparing it to someone that you like, or someone that you find charismatic and can talk on camera easily. Note down what is the difference between you and them, and just trying to edge closer towards that end. Not saying to copy them, of course, but try to take from their mannerisms what seems natural to you. But most of the common things that you'll find in that area is that you'll find yourself too stiff, your voice will be kind of monotone, and you won't feel comfortable to move your hands or just, like, Express with your body a lot. Those are like the most common ones What were you talking about, yeah, okay Length content theme So yeah, basically we're just even if you do it completely on your own without my involvement and also just in case like you're worried about I don't know, maybe. I'm just putting it out there. Maybe if it's like you don't want to be too invested into it at first without having a feel for it for yourself, this is just a way to like test the water and see what you enjoy on a personal level.

24:32 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah, so a quick like nutshell into the algorithm. YouTube basically has a viewer profile of every person that uses the platform, what they watch, what they interact with, the general niches that are related to the one that you like watching. For example, if you go on incognito on your browser right now and you type up watches, you'll find a lot of things that A lot of suggested videos, a lot of recommendations that are in niches adjacent to watches, like fragrances, skincare, pickup artistry, that kind of thing. Even though that's not what you targeted at first, but they know that the people that usually watch stuff about watches, they usually like to also watch stuff about skincare, women, et cetera, et cetera. So it's why when you're starting out, a more Quantity-centered approach tends to be useful for a couple of reasons. One is just like getting the reps out, not being as nervous. Yeah, okay, just have at it while just going to keep continue talking about what I'm talking about. And if it gets figured out, sure, great. If it doesn't, we can just keep going the same way that we are. Don't worry about that. What am I talking about?

25:58 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah. A more quantity-centered approach, one, to get the reps out so you can just become familiar with the process, and two, the more you do, the more you can kind of orient yourself better towards the type of content that you want to make, and so it helps you niche down and find your groove, so to speak, more. When you find yourself reaching Well, pretty much when you're comfortable with the process in general, you don't feel it as an obstacle and friction every time that you need to record, every time that you need to come up with the idea, et cetera, et cetera. When that point happens, you can focus on quality a lot more. But generally, you should... The goal is to generally be improving 1% with every video that you make. And that can mean anything. It can be in the on-camera presence. Maybe it's just an editing trick. Maybe you have a better mic. Maybe you have a more coherent storytelling structure. There are infinite ways to improve a video. But just having the RepSync can get you into a headspace to think more about that stuff. So that's why I'm talking about it that way. But the ideal, of course, is to keep pumping out as many videos as possible that are high quality. And that's like the holy grail of it. Because one, the more videos that you upload, the more profile, the more of a profile YouTube can create around your content. Okay, so the people that watch Trey Gustavano They will also probably like Jorge's content so recommend it to them, and that's how you get impressions Not fix that okay, I'll just keep going um what else what else Yeah Like I said earlier though the more that you focus on your I appreciate it. The more that you focus on yourself at the start, the slower the growth is, but the more loyal of an audience develops, but you can kind of like almost borrow fame and popularity from other things that are popular at the moment as well. When you've seen the initial upsurge of AI, yeah, I'm kind of hearing myself now.

28:28 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah, that's an interesting one. Try to say something.

28:37 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Try to say something. Is it working or not?

28:48 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Just leave it. It's all right. Just leave it. We'll figure it out some other time. Yeah.

28:57 - Abdallah Ahmed 
It's like when you saw like the initial upsurge of AI. Actually, that's a good thing. Let me just show you that while we're at it.

29:19 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Let's say, you know, just once.

29:31 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Okay, look, this is Google Transit, kind of lets you help gauge the... Yeah, sure, that sounds great, that sounds all right.

29:41 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Sure, we'll just schedule it up another time. When you have an opening, just let me know and I'll kind of organize things around that. Because I'm pretty sure that it's late at night, you're probably having dinner and you probably wanna go and just relax and head to sleep. Sounds about right?

30:02 - Abdallah Ahmed 
Yeah, I thought so. Yeah, sure. That sounds great. No, no worries about that at all. I just like wanted to give you the information so you can have just a rough idea of how things will go and how you might want to. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I just wanted to give you like the general nutshell of things so you can decide the steps from there. Yeah. And that sounds great. I'll let you have your dinner. Yeah, no worries at all. If you have any questions, any time, any kind of thing that you're wondering about, just anything at all, just DM me anytime, send a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible on it. Alright. Have a great night, man. Enjoy your dinner.

0:25 - Jorge Lewis 
And is he for you?

1:28 - Nazif Barassounon 
Hello, can you hear me?

1:42 - Nazif Barassounon 
Are you there, Nazir?

1:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello. Can you hear me?

1:46 - Jorge Lewis 
I can hear you, I guess.

1:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello.

1:55 - Nazif Barassounon 
How are you doing?

2:02 - Jorge Lewis 
It's on my side.

2:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, now?

2:08 - Nazif Barassounon 
How are you doing?

2:09 - Jorge Lewis 
There we go, yeah.

2:10 - Jorge Lewis 
I love how you've been talking for.

2:45 - Nazif Barassounon 
Did you return to Thailand?

2:50 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I'm in Thailand. Gonna go see Jonas later at the office. Here is very, I don't know about in Benin, but in a lot of places here, like in Thailand and in Vietnam, they have a lot of what they call co-working spaces. They're pretty much like cafes, but you can like, you pay to go there and it's like an office, you know?

3:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

3:13 - Nazif Barassounon 
There are places here for co-working too, but it's not well spread.

3:21 - Jorge Lewis 
The ones here, but it's like, you have to really weigh it out because it's a hundred bucks a month for like unlimited access. So if it's more productive there, then it's worth a hundred bucks.

3:38 - Nazif Barassounon 
It also helps socialize, you know, not being alone all day.

3:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. This was, this is my first time staying in an apartment by myself. And I like it, but it's like, if I worked here, like I did before in the apartment with Jonas, I would, I would go crazy.

3:56 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah.

3:56 - Jorge Lewis 
It helps with socializing, yeah.

4:05 - Nazif Barassounon 
On my end, I have no choice but to only be in my apartment. And people here... Yeah, I moved.

4:16 - Nazif Barassounon 
That's how it is.

4:18 - Nazif Barassounon 
Very good. There's a lot of space and it's quieter.

4:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Nice.

4:27 - Nazif Barassounon 
And here in my country, people don't know much about working from home. And they think that I'm a scammer, you know, like Nigerian scammer.

4:43 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I know how you feel, because it's like when I first started, I was like, oh, I do software. And they're like, oh, yeah, it's always very, the misconceptions are very strong for what we do.

4:55 - Jorge Lewis 
In America, too?

4:57 - Jorge Lewis 
When I was in Hong Kong, because I was quite young, and I was starting a business. Oh, you're starting a side hustle. It's just people have very strong misconceptions all the time.

5:10 - Jorge Lewis 
And they don't take it as real work.

5:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's not their fault. It's just life.

5:17 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah.

5:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, Jonas and I are, so he's staying at another apartment. The plan is to just work at the same place because we got tired of each other.

5:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I called it though, spending the entire 24 hours with someone is just, you just end up disliking them. So now we go to the office and we're happy, but at the apartment, we were just like, it was just too tiring. So our goal is to like, just go to the coworking space and work there together. And it'll be nice because in person, like we're working in person is a lot better. The communication and just things are just nice. Yeah, that's right. I think I need to add Jared. I don't think he gets notifications. That's my guess.

6:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you into investing and stuff like that?

7:05 - Nazif Barassounon 
On bitcoins or something like that. Yeah Bitcoin or stocks Yeah, but I'm not really I don't know much about it Okay, but like you're investing into it I Think it would be nice But I need to learn more about it hmm like crypto or or

7:37 - Jorge Lewis 
like stocks?

7:40 - Nazif Barassounon 
I know more about scriptos, but stock, I don't.

7:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for stocks, it's like, you mean know more about the companies, right? Or more technical?

7:59 - Nazif Barassounon 
The technical side, you know, how the money flows, how to choose stocks and what should I look for when choosing a stock.

8:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for me, it's just mostly for, I mean, I'm only into crypto right now, but when I want to get into stocks, it's, it's mostly just what companies are good. And I have a couple of people that work at the, uh, they have connections in Nvidia and they, they know that Nvidia is going to keep going up. I don't know if you saw, but Nvidia went 10% one.

8:40 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah. I know that Nvidia is a big thing right now.

8:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Crazy.

8:49 - Nazif Barassounon 
But to invest there, the entry bar must be very high, right?

8:57 - Jorge Lewis 
To invest at NVIDIA? Yeah. One of their shares is worth $1,000, but you can buy partial shares. So if you just have buy $10, $10 worth it. But only some platforms allow that.

9:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, OK.

9:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Crypto is expected to go up really high this year to in like November, December.

9:34 - Nazif Barassounon 
You know, for this kind of thing, it's a lot better if you have, you know, some amount of saving so that you don't put everything in those crypto stocks.

9:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, the yeah for the crypto is just like people the people that are really into it They they go all in everywhere. But for me, I've just put it put all the money like across of quite a few different coins Which clients I can V chain I know V chain XRP Solana, Polkadot, Cardano, and just very little Ethereum and Bitcoin. With the amount of money I've put in, it's not worth with Bitcoin.

10:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I think what's the target this year is I think 100k, I don't know.

10:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I heard that but I have no clue how accurate it is. Right now it's at...

11:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, this guy's taking very long.

11:19 - Nazif Barassounon 
Let me message him.

11:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I hate that I say my message.

12:11 - Nazif Barassounon 
So the final deadline will be two months from now, right?

12:21 - Nazif Barassounon 
According to the fact evaluated our specs.

12:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I said around two months in the voice message, but We could change it to whatever he's about to join. Like, I'm waiting. I can accept it, but we can change it to whatever we want.

12:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, whatever is realistic, of course. I think two months is realistic. Do you agree or? Yeah, I agree. All right, I'm letting him in.

12:57 - Jared Cairns 
Hello, hello.

12:58 - Jared Cairns 
Hello. Howdy.

13:07 - Jorge Lewis 
All good?

13:08 - Jared Cairns 
Yep, I can hear you guys, how's it going?

13:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Going good, yeah.

13:13 - Jared Cairns 
This is mustache era here, I can see.

13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, where's your one, huh?

13:19 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, right, no kidding. I gotta shave this off tonight, maybe I'll do it.

13:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So, how shall we do this? Got the Oaks back ready, so yeah. Yeah, I guess we can start from my last voice message and the plan moving forward. So to double check, what we're doing is we're going to give you a guarantee that we're going to finish within a time frame. That time frame is looking to be two months to be safe.

13:55 - Jorge Lewis 
And if we haven't completed the reasonable amount of work that's in the scope, then you can get the $7.5K back. OK.

14:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

14:08 - Jorge Lewis 
And for the payment, do you want to pay under the weekly structure or we can do bi-weekly as well. I think weekly doesn't really work anywhere.

14:24 - Jared Cairns 
Bi-weekly is fine. Yeah, bi-weekly should work.

14:28 - Jorge Lewis 
You paid a $50 for the bank transfer, right?

14:31 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think it's $45 something.

14:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have wise?

14:42 - Jared Cairns 
I've had it. I just got an ad for it through my job. That's why I recognize it. I can probably get it. I can check it out.

14:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, maybe check it out. Because we could use that as well. I think there's no trend, no fee, but I'm not sure about from you to wise. I don't know if there's a fee. Then from wise to us. It's no fee.

15:03 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, I see. Okay.

15:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I hear Jonas.

15:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, hey, Jonas.

15:15 - Jared Cairns 
Right now?

15:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello?

15:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello? Can you hear me?

15:22 - Eksno 
Yeah. I don't know how good my internet is.

15:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I was gonna say.

15:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Not the best.

15:32 - Eksno 
Yeah?

15:33 - Eksno 
Yeah.

15:36 - Eksno 
I hear you, at least.

15:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you hear me? Perfect. Sort of, yeah. Half the time. Yeah, we just went into it. We just started. So the guarantee is, we're looking at two months. We can put it on paper as soon as the spec's done. So like two months for the guarantee. And if it's not done, then he gets the last payment back or the last two payment back. We're going to do it bi-weekly. And then we just considered using Wwise, so that's what we've gone through so far. So let's go into the spec, I suppose. I mean, I could share the document and we can all go through it.

16:18 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I sensed the link.

16:39 - Jared Cairns 
There's a link in Discord you said, is that what I'm looking for?

16:41 - Eksno 
It's in Google Meets. Oh, OK.

16:44 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, here it is.

17:01 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, I was taking the L right there. Okay, I see it now.

17:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, everyone good?

17:23 - Jared Cairns 
Yep, I can see it now.

17:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, cool, cool. So I guess we could.

17:36 - Jorge Lewis 
We could go through this and then I have a section for the just some concerns or things that we need to confirm.

17:52 - Jorge Lewis 
And then besides everything else, that should be it.

17:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So the product overview, this hasn't changed, but it's good to get on paper, I suppose.

18:10 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, yep, I'm good with that. Okay, yep, I'm pretty familiar with the rest of this, I think.

18:22 - Jared Cairns 
And then, yep, 1.3 good.

18:28 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, 1.4. Okay, so we're at technical overview now. I think the above makes sense to me.

18:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool, cool. Okay. So yeah, the scope, by the way, this is a, It should be just a dot. Oh It's gonna be it's it's copied from the bottom section of three. So it's like an overview.

18:48 - Jared Cairns 
Oh, yeah. Gotcha.

18:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay So the technical review, I don't think this is too important. Your friend said that the stack we use is good So this on paper, this is what we use. I don't think we've ever shown it to you So if you want to show your guys, this is this is what you can show What is?

19:07 - Jared Cairns 
So I'm familiar with TypeScript, I'm familiar with Tailwind. What is SvelteKit? I've heard of this, but I don't know what it is exactly.

19:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's a web framework, pretty much, JavaScript framework that allows you to make web apps. You know NextJS?

19:26 - Jorge Lewis 
NextJS, yeah.

19:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's similar to that in a way.

19:32 - Jared Cairns 
Okay. Talk to me like I'm five. Is this front to back? Is this all JavaScript or SvelteKit?

19:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Could be anything. Yeah. So SvelteKit helps us write the, combine the HTML with the TypeScript in a nice way. Okay. Yeah. And it makes it really, really convenient for us.

19:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

19:53 - Jorge Lewis 
But also like it's super, This is super biased, but it's the best framework out there.

19:58 - Jared Cairns 
It's the best. I don't really, like you said, I don't really need to know this, but well, I mean, I do need to know the basics because people ask me.

20:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. Stokke actually allows you, one of the key capabilities of Stokke is that it allows you to do the entire web app, like the backend and frontend in one project. They combine the backend and the frontend. That gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of how we want to do things. Your project is done entirely in SvelteKit, but other projects that use a lot of AI components, we use Svelte for the front end, and then for the back end, we use Python. So it does give us a lot of flexibility.

20:38 - Jared Cairns 
So you can use it as a whole feature, so you can really do whatever you want. Exactly.

20:45 - Jorge Lewis 
ShedCN, just component library. SuperBase is the database platform.

20:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Yeah. It makes sense.

20:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, infrastructure of ourselves hosting. Um, there's no, there's no backend or API at the moment.

21:02 - Eksno 
So I think we could, or yeah, it just, yeah, that's one can be joined the way we don't use a separate pipe and backend. So yeah.

21:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Super base there. Cloudfire. Okay, cool. Uh, So if you want, we can dive into section three. This is where we're listing the things that actually matter for you.

21:34 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, it makes sense to me if you guys are good on the rest.

21:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, cool. So when we're doing specifications, and especially scopes, the hardest thing is to not miss out anything. The easy part is going through everything and making it correct.

21:54 - Jorge Lewis 
I think after this meeting, both teams are going to take the time to really go through it and make sure nothing is missing. The missing part is the most crucial because when things are missing, then other things have to be changed.

22:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Makes sense, yeah.

22:09 - Jorge Lewis 
I suppose if you want, you can go one by one through the steps and when there's something that's Possibly concerning that it might be incorrect or missing.

22:16 - Jared Cairns 
Let us know Okay, so do you want me to start with this question section right here? Um, I think we could How about we I can probably answer some of these if it's easier we Okay, how about we do that?

22:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, let's do that first. Okay Okay, so so it's modifying a contract date the same as creating a new contract entry or does it exist as a new version?

22:39 - Jared Cairns 
So ideally it would exist. I mean, I don't know technically what it would exist as. It should be presented as a new version of the same contract. So it should be, you're just changing the date. Because really a lot of times contracts don't have dates in them. The contract is something more dynamic and fluid. So it should just be a new version of the exact same contract. A new contract would be like legal has reviewed it again. It's been signed again. So on and so forth. And the second part of the question, is this what parent contracts are for my confusing parent contracts with versions? That's a good question. So parent contract, basically any contract that exists, at least the way I see this being designed and you guys are the experts. I'm not the way I would foresee it being designed is any contract you sign is basically its own parent. So if it's contract one, its own parent is one. The only time there's a child contract is if you make an amendment to it. So if you have a contract for six months of chemistry services, and then you're going to cancel them, you're going to cancel them halfway through and just to be three months, you'll do a change order a negative change order to that contract.

23:54 - Jared Cairns 
And it's minus three months. So the parent is six months and then the child is the minus three months. Bringing like one total contract that is three months with an amendment to it, if that makes sense. The parent contract, child contract is separate than that. Now, I will say the nuance and confusing part is you are right in that if you have a situation where there's a parent and child contract, most likely it's significant enough of a change that the dates will also be changing. That is where it gets a little tricky. And to be honest, this exact question right here is kind of the problem that's trying to be solved with all these versions of contracts being out there that are too difficult for people to track individually. So a really good question. So they're sort of related, but not quite.

24:52 - Eksno 
I see you wrote on child contracts or amendments of amounts and sometimes states. That's not exactly my interpretation. For me, it was just any amendment, which could be like off amounts, which amount, uh, change states.

25:04 - Jared Cairns 
So sometimes I would say it might not even be of an amount every time. Sometimes you're changing the beneficiary. Sometimes you're changing something, something really, yeah. Something really common in biotech is. You'll book your manufacturing a year out and your drug fails, but you don't want to lose your slot. So you just amend the contract to say, instead of using compound A, we'll use compound B. And then instead of going through all that bullshit, you have one amendment that says replace everything that says compound A with compound B. And that's the change order. Yeah. So it's usually amounts changing, but not always.

25:45 - Eksno 
Are child contracts in essence, just any amendment, like all amendments?

25:50 - Jared Cairns 
Any amendment. Usually there's a change of an amount or a change in scope that affects the dates, but not always, not necessarily.

26:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Do child contracts don't have to be signed?

26:04 - Jared Cairns 
Child contracts have to be signed. Really the only difference is that ideally when you view it, Cause there can be long-term contracts like at companies I've been at, there are long-term contracts that could have nine amendments to it. That may be a three-year contract. I can think of like a long clinical trial, for example, you could amend it multiple times coming at work at now for their phase two had nine protocol amendments. So in reality basically A parent contract exists as any contract that's signed is basically, I would consider like its own parent, if you have to consider it that way. And then anything amending that contract, whether it's any amendment at all, becomes a child of that contract. And then ideally you can kind of view them all together because otherwise it's kind of truncated and you don't get the full picture.

27:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Because there's two things, there's two different systems that are kind of overlapping a little bit. There's modifying a contract and then there's creating a child contract, correct? Right. Modifying a contract, the 99% of the times is changing the dates because of some real world delay. Yeah.

27:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's right.

27:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. And when you modify a contract, the other 1% the time, what is it? What can it be? Um, in terms of something that's basically not formalized that we're trying to capture, like if, when you modify a contract, you can change the dates, but you can also change the what.

28:00 - Jared Cairns 
So if you modify a contract in terms of modifying, in terms of what we're looking to do, which is basically send out, here's the contracts you own, send us back any changes. 99.9% of the time it's the dates. Occasionally, what we'd be looking to capture is there may be some niche accounting guidance that we need to track. For example, if the terms of the lease are changing, but they're only being discussed, but haven't been formalized yet, or if you're expecting manufacturing of a contract to maybe push back, but maybe not. That's kind of the context we'd be looking to get within like a notes field, like a free text field as well. But the vast majority, I would pretty much safely say everything we'd be looking to track materially would just be the dates changing. And then any amounts changing would have to be formalized.

28:56 - Jared Cairns 
would have to be formalized, meaning somebody would have to submit a formal change order for us, from a financial perspective, to feel comfortable taking the liability off our books, for example. We can't just hear you say, we're gonna save $250,000 on this contract without ink to paper somewhere.

29:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, okay, that clears things up. Okay, cool. Thanks, Jonas, for writing things down, by the way. So next one, does the relationship between parent contracts and child contracts have any functional use yet?

29:30 - Jared Cairns 
Just for the future. So what I would imagine, I mean, what would be great is if you could have one line summarizing all of that, but I don't even know quite how to formalize it, how to present that in my brain.

29:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, it'd be great if I could see like, Like you just said, how it's like just a way to view them all put together without being truncated.

29:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

29:56 - Jared Cairns 
Cause right now, so for example, I can see where this would get tricky and I don't have the answer just yet. I think what we back up a little bit, I think where it's presented in the report still needs to be individually. So if you have. To go back to the same example, six months of services minus three months of services. I don't think there's an easy way to combine those on one line to make it clear. I think you still show six months minus three months and then you net them out separately. I just don't know how you would combine it without making it more confusing. I don't know if that answers this question. Does the relationship between parent-contractor insurance have any functional use yet or just for the future? Yeah. So the functional use would really be, um, basically when you're sending out or somebody is having to review these contracts and you can say like, what is this? Like if you have, which is common, you might have a hundred contracts with one vendor and of those hundred contracts, 20 of them might be like change order one, change order one, change order one for all this information. It's really confusing to understand what it's referencing. And that's where the parent contract comes in is you can basically just say, I'm looking at anything with a parent contract of one. Okay. Well, when you do that, you can see the original contract and then the first change order. And then, you know, that that's like a one, two step and you can get all your thoughts out about that contract. And then you can look at parent contract of two parent contract of three or whatever.

31:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm trying to think how that plays into the development.

31:45 - Jared Cairns 
I would say for now, if it was just a data point, I mean, you guys tell me. I'm just saying, I'm just speaking out loud. You tell me if this is totally stupid or too difficult. I would say when you enter a contract, it gets assigned a number. That number is it's like contract number and also its parent contract number at the same time. So in my example, I'm using the first contract you ever enter is contract one. And it has a separate field saying parent contract is one. And then let's say you're going about your business and then you're entering contract 50. When you enter contract 50, What's the parent contract? It could either be itself, 50, but this is a change to contract one. So again, parent contract is one. So then when you go to look at your 50 contracts, only those two are referencing parent contract one, so you know they're related. That would be my thought. And then when you send it out, you could just sort by that, because then everything will be in order. You sort by your parent contract. Here's contract one, here's contract 50, and then you go to the two. So I think that's the simplest way. There's gotta be a more, I'm sure there's a better way, but I would say don't worry about it.

33:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, because on the back end, the linking that you mentioned, the relationship has been done. But the getting functional use is like can be added. We have the infrastructure on the back end to just connect them. They're connected right now. We don't need to do anything with them. Like, for example, sorting them to be grouped somewhere. Is that necessary yet?

33:26 - Jared Cairns 
Let me ask you this in that report field. Is it easy to make those headers like sortable? Like you see on like a lot of websites if you're like, is it easy to make all those sortable? Because I feel like that if you did that it would basically solve the issue because then you could just bring in parent contracts sort by that and then that would be a done deal.

33:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So, Jared, you're using a number, by the way, for your contract. You're using 01. Can you remind me if we went with that and are using simple numbers like that for each company?

33:57 - Nazif Barassounon 
Oh, the contract number?

34:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

34:03 - Nazif Barassounon 
So, there's also a clarification that needs to be made there. Is it something that you have by your hand? You know, the contract number, is it something we can generate on our side?

34:22 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, you would just generate it on your side and that basically becomes its number because otherwise it doesn't have, it has like, obviously like a counterparty you're agreeing with, it has like a scope of work, but it doesn't have any number that gets sent at any time because usually When these things happen, my company would have a contract number. Whoever I sign with, they have a separate contract number. And that's really just because we both have to have systems to track this. So we'll have different contract numbers that aren't the same. The one thing that is the same that people use to cross-reference is a purchase order number, which That would be like version this software down the road There would be a purchase order number that you can use to reference your billing, but I won't burden you guys with that part just yet Okay So the the sorting part is possible for for the data table Yeah, so I took a look at the super base.

35:24 - Jorge Lewis 
We are storing the contract number. So just on the back end to give you some context here, each contract in all databases, every row should be unique. It has a unique ID. That one's very disgusting. It's not nice to look at. But we're also storing contract number, which is like And this one's just every new contract, it goes up one, right? So yeah, we can add a column for the contract number and then you can start by that.

35:49 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, I think that will pretty much solve it because then that makes it pretty easy. As long as it's sortable, you can really, if it's sortable within the instance, like within the software, then I don't think you need to worry about anything else because you could cut it and just, you could, as long as you can either filter within the software and or spit it out to Excel or something and manipulate it. I don't think you guys need to worry about doing anything else.

36:18 - Nazif Barassounon 
Um, okay. Um, the number, uh, should it be consecutive with being a given organization?

36:30 - Jared Cairns 
Sorry.

36:32 - Nazif Barassounon 
Um, does the numbers need to be consecutive? Like, in a given organization, if the first contract entered is one, the second, should it be necessarily two?

36:50 - Jared Cairns 
It is something that- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's a good question. Yes, and the reason why is if you're a company that has a sufficiently complicated financial corporate structure, that you'll face from both your IT department, your financial auditors, which is like, here's all your contracts, one to 50, or can I see records for all one to 50? If you're missing somebody's gonna say, what the fuck is this? Who signed something and deleted it? This money could be out in the ether, blah, blah, blah. So yes, it should be sequential. And I guess the other piece now that I'm thinking about it is, A lot of companies, virtually every company is going to have contracts existing before they get on with the software. I mean, it'd be amazing if you could completely start from the beginning, but that's just not reality. So the other function would be if it's possible to upload like through a CSV and get all their historical data in and then start new contracts from there. So same example, let's say a company has contracts, you can upload them basically populate the software with data in their instance, and then they can enter a new contract, and then that new contract's 51. And then it just goes sequentially from there, I guess would be a thing to think about.

38:18 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, of course it's doable, but it's going to be tough because the table we're looking at that we're trying to import is going to be different across each.

38:33 - Jared Cairns 
So what I would say is like, Well, let me ask you this. Is it easy if you can get it in a singular format, like in a CSV file? If you can make them conform to a CSV file that matches our fields exactly, is that easy to upload then? I think so.

38:53 - Nazif Barassounon 
The issue I see here is that in our system, we're using authentication. So each time somebody uploads or enters a contract, the contract is associated with them.

39:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Could, for that little bit, could we do it manually on our side? Could we?

39:18 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I mean, I feel like it might just be some sweat getting it in for existing people. I've been thinking about offering that as another service. Because this accounting process is already complicated enough. I was thinking about offering that as a service where you also provide the software, but you also just do it for people. And then you basically send it to them for review. I mean, you could do it. The problem is if you grow to companies that are big enough, it just becomes a big...

39:47 - Jorge Lewis 
At that point, of course, we can find a way to make it more scalable. But for the first few companies you're working with, manually, if they give it in columns, we can associate their organization ID and the user IDs manually.

40:02 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. And that's kind of what I, yeah. And I could, I mean, I could probably do that as well. I think like just literally just entering it if needed. But that's just one thing I've, I've thought about the, um, could be a monkey wrench.

40:19 - Jorge Lewis 
The way, the way I explained that last day, is that correct? We can, if they add, or if we manually add the, some of the IDs, then it should be okay.

40:29 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yes, it should be given that all the employees are correctly registered with the correct ideas, it should be fine.

40:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so maybe some manual work behind the scenes, but I think you could probably take care of that, Jared, right?

40:46 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, let me ask a stupid question here. The issue is that the employees aren't, the employees wouldn't be set up to accept the data. Like they wouldn't, the contract wouldn't know where to be assigned to because employees aren't set up yet. Is that the issue?

41:02 - Nazif Barassounon 
Um, that's a possible issue, but we can make sure that, um, the admin and, um, registered all of the employees first.

41:14 - Jared Cairns 
Because what, yeah, what I'm imagining is like an onboarding scenario is that you have to have, If you want to get started, you have to give us a list of your contracts with the amounts, the dates you want to start with, the owners, and then basically with that data, everything gets populated in whichever order we need to do it. All the data would be provided by the client. I've had to do this many times where you provide them pages and pages of shit to get set up through implementation. So if that's the issue that we might not have data, I think we can get past that.

41:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like with MVPs, it's really important to not try to do all these little things, whereas they can be met. There's a common saying that one of the founders of YC said is do things that don't scale in software startups.

42:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

42:05 - Jorge Lewis 
The common notion, I think it was Google that was so popular to do things that are scalable, but doing things like this that can be done manually through Google Forms, and you can make the accounts for them, then that's probably the way to go for the first, like the first two clients, three clients, it takes, I think it's worth the manual hours compared to us trying to develop it.

42:29 - Jared Cairns 
No, yeah, I totally don't give a shit about doing it, even if it was farther than that. I just wanted to think about it in case it was easier now before we get, I mean, before we get any farther, I guess, but no, it's fine with me. I'm not worried about that.

42:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Cool. Cool.

42:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. Let's double checking that the versions are not functional yet.

42:55 - Jared Cairns 
Versions have no functional use. And that, and when you're calling a version is we send out data. The dates change, it comes back to us.

43:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Versions are only applied for when you modify a contract. So change the dates.

43:12 - Jared Cairns 
Right. Okay. So we're saying double checking the versions have no functional use. So the changing of the versions is key to basically using this as a continuous reporting tool. So the idea is on a monthly or quarterly basis, kind of as you wish, you can send out to get updated information. And with that feedback, you can generate financial accrual entries to put into your financial statement. So I would say the versions are pretty important because they function as basically giving you an up-to-date picture of the operations of your entire business.

44:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So I would say, But let's say we have a contract and we need to change the date. The date's changed in the new one. The old one, functional, there's no use for the old one. The old one can be removed. It's just the new one we care about.

44:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see what you're saying.

44:21 - Jorge Lewis 
The old one, in my eyes, is only useful for when we want to look back at history, but at the moment, we don't need to.

44:29 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, you would never look at two at the same time, really. I mean, I can imagine my perfect world, there's some uses for it, but once it's updated, looking forward, that's your update. Even if they updated it to the new dates and they're like, oh shit, I want to go back to the old ones, that wouldn't go back to version one, I'd see that becoming version three. A new version, yeah, yeah, exactly.

44:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so what we have now is just we're storing the version number, but there's no functional use yet, which is good because later down the road, if we want to add any use or functionality to the version, it's implemented. These are one of the things that would be hard to add later down the road. Retro, 15 minutes.

45:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, gotcha, yeah.

45:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so is the contract and bill approval flow the same? Yeah, so are they the same?

45:18 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, there's no, for the bill approval, there's no signature. So you don't need to, it doesn't need to reach the person with signing authority. It just needs to go to the approved level. Um, and that person's approval needs to be more than what the bill is.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So the, the, they're the same in that they go through the same people or yes.

45:39 - Jared Cairns 
So it goes through basically. Um, so every bill pretty much should be linked to a contract and then So every bill is linked to a contract, and that owner has a boss, and yeah, so it goes the same way. Contracts end up at the signer, but bills just go up through the exact same chain. Yep.

46:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But as soon as the bill gets sent to someone with an approval threshold that's above it, then it stops and it's done.

46:09 - Jared Cairns 
It stops and it's done. Yeah, that's right. Assuming they hit approve, yeah, it stops and it's done.

46:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool.

46:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Nice, nice. The person reviewing a contract on review day is the owner of the contract. So that's on review day.

46:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep. Okay.

46:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So review day, I'm thinking, I'm thinking it's just going to be a button, an admin page somewhere, somewhere on the app that just says reviewed, start review day. And it just starts the process.

46:40 - Jared Cairns 
And it's just, um, it just kicks out every record that you have.

46:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Every record within a timeframe. You can set that. I think you'll have to configure the timeframe, right? Um, the period.

46:55 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. Let me think about this for a second. The one thing that I, now that I think about it, the one thing that we would want to do, can you make it selectable for which contracts, um, that you, that you could send out? Like I can say, you know, of this whole list of contracts, I want these, these ones to be reviewed and these ones not to be like a checkbox or, or anything like that.

47:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Or it's just all or nothing is what you're... Would that be manually done by the...

47:23 - Jared Cairns 
I think it could be manual for this version if that's something that's easy to implement. I don't think it would be incredibly time consuming. The one thing I'm thinking of is, let's say you get into a company that has a couple of years of operations and you're sending these out for review. All these ones that are completed and don't need to be reviewed again and again and again, I want a way to exclude those. So either manually selecting or like if the completion date is in the past, if the end date is in the past, maybe not send those ones out.

48:00 - Jared Cairns 
I don't know.

48:00 - Jared Cairns 
Of course, of course.

48:02 - Jared Cairns 
I'm thinking of, or just a button that says completed. And then if the review function ignores that, that would probably actually be best if we could do that.

48:16 - Jorge Lewis 
And the completed, is that done automatically? What makes it completed when it's out?

48:25 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I would say defaults to completed if the end date is in the past would be good. And then maybe, if the end date's in the past, marking it completed automatically would be good, I think is the best case.

48:41 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, yeah, it's a good starting point, I think, yeah. I mean, we don't need a property completed. We can just check, just not send the ones that are in the past.

48:51 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that works for me.

48:53 - Jorge Lewis 
But we do have the easy capability, thanks to ShedCN, to add a checkbox for each row.

49:00 - Jared Cairns 
I mean, the only reason I think that could be good is if you're running it, let's say you're running it as of 12-31 and a bunch of stuff has 12-31 end dates, you don't necessarily know that those are completed because you haven't gotten the most recent update. And you'd constantly be running into cutoffs like that because everything is like a start of a month or end of a month. So I'm thinking the checkbox could be useful. But like I said, that's if you just, I can see a bunch of different ways to fix this issue. I would rather just hedge on the side of people having to look at a little more stuff and getting it right than too less. Yeah.

49:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, I think what the approach we have is good just to, if they're in the past, don't do them. Everything else, just send them over. And later down the road, we can add some fine.

49:50 - Jorge Lewis 
The person reviewing. Okay. Okay. Yep. Thanks, Jonas. I think that's Jonas. Yeah. Okay. So, so now those are the questions. All good. Now we're getting into this. I think what we'll do is just, you can read them. Ah, the meeting's almost done. Isn't it? 10 minutes.

50:13 - Jared Cairns 
Um, you guys have more questions in here. You just want to walk through it.

50:16 - Jorge Lewis 
These are, these are kind of for you to look at and tell us, no, they're wrong, but I'm assuming none of them are wrong. And maybe, and maybe just to, to check if anything is missing, but the missing part is hard to do because yeah, no, I feel you.

50:30 - Jared Cairns 
Let me look here. Um, there's not too much here. I can probably probably get through this. Let's see. Contract repository for storing submitted data and finalized forms. Easy access and retrieval. That's good. Entry form allows you to submit contracts. Perfect.

50:48 - Jared Cairns 
Signed. Yeah. OK. Contract can be rejected when it confirms the repository. Yes. Modification. OK. What's this? Shall we formally call this a delay instead of modification since that's the only functionality? Can be made to a contract by updating the end date.

51:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Here.

51:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you got it. So I brought it to the top. Instead of calling it a modification, let's call it a delay. But now that we've cleared it up, I don't think it's necessary.

51:24 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think because also there are times occasionally when it's not a delay, it actually gets shortened. I think modification is fine. Modification, updating the end date. I would say also the start date.

51:41 - Jared Cairns 
So let me read this again. Only most recent version of the contract is presented through the app.

51:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep. So if I get basically the most recent data, I guess we'll just, we just, when I went through, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got you.

52:07 - Jared Cairns 
Contracts can be a parent slash child of another contract. That's right. Ability to view the PDF of a contract. Yep, that's right. Ability for a signer to sign a contract using digital signing. This, if we don't have, is not, I would say this is a low priority. This one, if we don't have this, I'm not going to be too upset for the digital signing.

52:33 - Jared Cairns 
Review day allows contracts to be reviewed by their owners en masse to ensure start and end dates are accurate. Yeah, and then that's ideally triggered by like an email link or something. Basically, it's sent directly to them. They can update it, submit, submit back, and it can be reviewed. That seems right. View days enter contracts.

52:59 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, that's right. New days enters contracts alive within a certain time frame. I guess it would basically be anything before a certain date. Or I guess that I should say is after a certain date. Sorry, yeah, after a certain date.

53:19 - Jared Cairns 
Bill management, restoring and viewing bills, yep. Bill entry form to allow users to submit bills, yes. Newly created bills are sent through an approval flow, yes.

53:32 - Jared Cairns 
Handling a bill of rejection, remembering a contract, additional deletion, yes. Ability to attach and view invoice PDF.

53:39 - Jared Cairns 
That's right.

53:43 - Jared Cairns 
Report page that blends data from the phone counter, bill amount, accrual balance, and open amount. Users can select a specific period the report will be built upon. So I do know this part. I feel like this could be... Difficult to have historical data. There are like enterprise level systems out there that won't give you Historically accurate reports. This is like the problem with power bi and other systems that have like continuously updating data So just looking at the second bullet point on 3.3 Basically it would be it would be really cool if you could run it as of, what date is it today? If you could run it as a 531, you can see the calculation and then you enter new bills, you get new contracts, you change dates, you have all this new information coming in at 630 and you get your number then. But you could still run it for 531 with all that new information and have a way to still get the 531 data. I'm not gonna hold you guys to that. I'm not gonna hold you guys to that one.

54:49 - Jorge Lewis 
But it would be really cool. It's just like a cutoff. So like let's say I want to see from five days ago. I can do that, right?

54:58 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think the only thing would be you'd have to have a way to make sure like new bills aren't coming in. The versions that exist at that time are the ones you present when somebody runs it later. I mean from the layman's perspective, I could see like you store a version of that report that's accessible, maybe not through the traditional live reporting number, like you go to like a historical reports tab. And then every time you guys know, like automatically at midnight, it sends a version of it there for you to review or whatever. And maybe there's not dynamic linking or whatever, but

55:35 - Jorge Lewis 
To me, that sounds simpler because we don't have to track the complication with having it not do that, which that's what is having it create snapshots of every day. The other one is to have it just dynamically check, okay, look from this date and backwards. The problem with that one is that any version changes of a contract have to be taken into account. And that one's more complicated than the creating snapshots.

56:05 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I would say, and the snapshot thing, I would say, doesn't need to be daily. A lot of this stuff does not need to be daily. It's only ever going to be done monthly. So I would say that's another thing to keep in mind is that nobody cares about this stuff day to day. It's month to month and or quarter to quarter. So it may, this review day functionality, like for the company I'm at now, we'd only ever do it four times a year. Even public company, we only do it 12 times a year. So it's not something that needs to be so like refreshing and accurate and all this shit going on every single day. It's more of a month to month thing.

56:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Just one more concern to put out just to put it out there is that the snapshot one is probably less scalable. Or is less scalable because you're storing more data, but yeah, just a concern. I think with tech nowadays, I don't think it's really an issue at all. I was mostly thinking it was daily.

57:02 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think eventually that would be a really nice feature, but I'm not worried about it.

57:07 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a nice to have, right? It's very nice. Definitely. It's sexy. Not stressing about it.

57:13 - Jared Cairns 
Email notifications. Email notification systems to all user events. Yep, that would be amazing. That's like a really big value add when you get that. It really sells software when you can do that.

57:27 - Jared Cairns 
User register their company for platform. Sign in to account with my company. Sign with thresholds.

57:39 - Jared Cairns 
Company account with shared information.

57:46 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, that makes sense.

57:49 - Jared Cairns 
Projects, departments, accounts, vendors, spending categories, yes. Each user can manage their personal accounts. Yep, that makes sense to me.

58:02 - Jared Cairns 
Payment integration, Stripe and API. Organizations can manage their monthly subscription. And is there a way to do, I'm guessing it's easy to do like an option where you can just say pay, pay monthly, pay annual, whatever, and like figure in like a discount for people. A lot of B2B software in this space is paid annually ahead of time. Um, I mean, it would be great to have monthly recurring revenue, but if somebody was going to go annual to start, I was thinking about like, you could just give them a discount for a couple of months just because you're getting the cash up front. But not a high priority item.

58:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Does he want to answer that one?

58:48 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, I think it's possible to have both the monthly and annual subscription with some discount.

58:56 - Jared Cairns 
And just set your price. Okay, that should be easy then.

59:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Nazif, we were thinking because the Stripe bit is a bit of work on our side to develop and make sure it's all good and dandy. I was thinking that you could set up the payments from any customer initially can be done manually to you or you can create a Stripe link and they just pay and then we create their account manually. Or we give their accounts the access, the payment, like it's just a tick. They create all their accounts like usual, but they don't have any access to anything until you tell us, give them a tick, and we give them a tick. And then that way, because the Stripe thing, it shouldn't delay things, but that's for the case that you want to start moving, you could start making money way sooner.

59:49 - Jared Cairns 
A lot of people, for contracts like these, at least what I've seen is that, and we might get kicked off the call here, is that it's not really done.

59:58 - Jared Cairns 
You're gonna get cut off.

59:59 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, it's not really done. I'll restart it. Okay. All right.""","Spec overview pt 1 Transcript.txt"

back to this one thing. So for having the Stripe, I don't know if it's super easy or more of a pain in the ass. A lot of times in the B2B space for the CLM specifically, you're not paying through Stripe or not paying through a credit card. It's literally just like a direct wire transfer. Once a year, annually. I think for something of this scale, the Stripe is better. But is it a pain in the ass to implement that? Or is it pretty much out of the box?

0:31 - Jorge Lewis 
I didn't see if you had a match, though.

0:39 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, but for the Stripe payments, it's handling all the edge cases can be really tough. It's something that could take two weeks. If it's something that is okay for you, we can go ahead and implement it.

1:04 - Jared Cairns 
What would the edge cases be in this case? What would the issues be? Sorry, I'm naive here.

1:11 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, it's making sure that all of the data related to an organization is correctly set and safe. Checking all of the the expiration date you know if it's it is paid a month in a monthly basis making sure that um the monthly basis are respected if it's annually making sure it's the the annually um subscription is respected it's all those cases and you know, handling the errors from Stripe, making sure that we, for example, the user don't pay and then don't get access to the app. That's some of the case I'm referring to.

2:10 - Jared Cairns 
But it's really more out of your hands. It's on Stripe side of being a problem, not necessarily the integration. Or I guess it's kind of at that point kind of mixed.

2:22 - Jorge Lewis 
They give us the ability to handle the things, but it's out of the box. It's quite hard to deal with everything.

2:31 - Jared Cairns 
Got you. Okay. So even if I said it's only monthly, only one price, you only pay by credit card, it still could be giving you kickbacks or errors. So no matter what. Okay. So, so basically to set it up, tell me if I'm wrong here. It sounds like it's set it up. It's easy. The inevitable errors may be time consuming. But I would figure if like, if unless we were dealing with a lot of scale, if the issue was like, this person signed up to pay, and their payment didn't register, and they don't have access, we could easily just say, give this person access, we know they're trying to pay.

3:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
for example.

3:17 - Jorge Lewis 
This is more for a holistic view of us. The first client, who is this going to be? Do you know the customer?

3:23 - Jared Cairns 
I would probably say if I'm able to sell it to them, the company called Vetman Bio.

3:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. And you know them how?

3:31 - Jared Cairns 
So the CEO of this company was a former COO at DTX. And then my girlfriend's one of the few employees there as well. And they have She was just going through, torturing herself, going through this exact contract process. And I was like, I... Is she an accountant as well? What's that?

3:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Is she an accountant as well?

3:51 - Jared Cairns 
No, she's smart. She's a PhD. She's too smart for this dumb shit.

3:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, okay. So then for this client, this customer, would it not be professional enough or would it not be an option to do the payment link where you just blink, they pay, and then immediately we can make it so that you can give them access straight away.

4:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that would be an option for sure. Yeah.

4:16 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, I think we go ahead with that. What do you think Nazif? I think that was kind of like what we were hoping for.

4:21 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yes. I think for at the beginning, it should be fine. And maybe later when we fine tune the app and integrate it automatically.

4:34 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, cool.

4:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'll remove this line. Or.

4:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I can add an asterisk or a note saying this is not included in the initial. Yeah.

5:02 - Jared Cairns 
You could like strike it through or do whatever is makes the most sense.

5:17 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah. Okay. Yep.

5:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, and then marketing pages. Yeah, we just have the landing page that we made at the very start. Yeah, just very basic, right?

5:31 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I think for now that's fine. Yeah, it would be nice. I mean, all these things have room for refinement, but I think everything is looking good enough for this stage.

5:45 - Jared Cairns 
And I see you just added a note. Jorge, did we answer that? How does editing a bill work when in approval flow?

5:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's already been implemented or going to be implemented because I think for that, that's kind of a, there's gonna be quite a bit of UI to, to make that work. Whereas maybe a better solution is just to reject it and tell, and the proof, the person that rejected it, just tell the owner, Hey, there was something there. This was the problem. Try again. Or like do it again with this one.

6:19 - Jared Cairns 
Oh yeah. That's what I would envision. I don't know what.

6:24 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, they would. Yeah, I would just say reject. I mean, if you could add like a free text field that goes with it, if not, I'm not that worried about it. But yeah, just reject. Try again. That's a good way to put it. That's what I would imagine.

6:37 - Jorge Lewis 
And request a re-entry.

6:41 - Nazif Barassounon 
And in the case we want to remove a bill, if it's not all right at all.

6:49 - Jared Cairns 
I would say, I mean, usually what I see is that, that it, well, what it appears to be for me is that that record is kept and just like kept in a draft state. It's just sent back to the beginning of that approval workflow. Um, and the reason why that works for people like me is usually if somebody has a stack of 50 bills, like in their outlook, when they enter it, they put it to like enter bill or whatever. And when you reject something, it just ends up not being in a queue anywhere if they fuck it up and you reject it and it gets deleted. And then they don't know where to get it from Then the vendors calling you that they need to be paid. Um, so if you could reject it, it stays in draft form, goes to that person. That would be ideal.

7:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

7:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's the best to put this down. So.

7:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So if they reject it, then?

7:48 - Nazif Barassounon 
But one thing we could do is just, instead of thinking of it as rejected or not, we can just make a request. And within the request, we can state if we want it to be modified or rejected. Rejected could be it's in the draft state, and modified would mean we want it to be updated. I don't know what you think.

8:18 - Jared Cairns 
Well, let me think of a, tell me if this is stupid. What if you utilizing like the same logic you've built, like when you approve, it goes to the next person in the chain. What about if you hit reject, it sends it back to the first person in the chain. Cause that would, that would basically work every time because if you're rejecting it, you're sending it back to the beginning and saying, fix it. And then that way you don't have to build any complicated rules. You can just have like the same logic, just sending it the other direction.

8:49 - Jared Cairns 
Tell me if that's totally stupid, just tell me.

8:52 - Jorge Lewis 
It's funny.

8:53 - Jorge Lewis 
It's like, we're going in this direction for the approval flow. It can't be that hard to just go this direction. But anyways, I think more of the issue is just the capability, adding the capability to modify the contract again.

9:14 - Jared Cairns 
Are we talking about, sorry, is this the contract or the bill that we're talking about?

9:18 - Nazif Barassounon 
I think it's the bill, right?

9:20 - Jared Cairns 
The bill, right. I guess it's a little interchangeable, but in that case, I mean, if it gets rejected like that, I would like anything can be edited again. It can kind of be a blank slate again.

9:33 - Jorge Lewis 
You could come back with all the... I think we start with that. How does that sound? We just start with a blank slate.

9:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe.

9:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, I think if we, if we email the owner saying, Hey, this was rejected, then it's somewhere in the records and they, they'll have some way to, to go back to it. At least at the very start.

10:04 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, I would say they rejected it. They get an email saying they rejected it. And then. The person who has to fix it, I guess maybe they get a notification as well. Yeah, that's fine to start. That works for me.

10:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I think the simplest solution may be is all of what we just said. So it gets rejected. The owner gets emailed saying, Hey, this was rejected. And there's a link in the email. If you click the link, it pre fills the bill entry form with all the data and they can, and then they're, they're technically not starting from a blank slate.

10:51 - Jared Cairns 
So I would say the only difference is that person who's the owner of the contract is not usually the person who's entering this information, they're disapproving it. So the person who fucked up the entry, they would be notified. They're not necessarily associated with that contract. Oh, okay.

11:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so whoever, whoever this bill person is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, cool.

11:13 - Jared Cairns 
And yes, in that case.

11:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

11:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Is that, is that simple enough or have I. Yeah. Okay.

11:25 - Jared Cairns 
He's Jerrified it. Jerrified it. The opposite direction. Um, okay, cool.

11:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so that, so the build thing, we'll let me check, make sure it's all up to date. So request a reentry. Thank you.

11:45 - Jared Cairns 
And then I have an idea for that. It was in the initial oak spec for another report. And it's basically just to track a different type of contract. I think we talked about it like the law firms and any other vendors not on a specific timeline. And I think you can basically Let me just back up. How hard is it to create a dynamic reporting tool similar to a pivot table, where you could say, I want to include this field, this field, in the rows and columns, and they start to populate that way? Is that really difficult? Are there pre-built tools to do that? Is it easy to do? Well, choosing which columns will be displayed Yeah, so you're like, you're like, I want to create a new report. And it's like, Okay, what do you want in it? And you like, the way I've always seen, it's like you just drag information over where it's like, I want to see the vendor's name, I want to see the month, and then it starts basically cross referencing it, and it gives you some output, like what I've most, what I've seen it the most in is in the pivot table in Excel. But um, I'm just thinking about, instead of like going through the pain of building that out, like one time, you could just kind of leave it to people to create their own versions of it.

13:11 - Jared Cairns 
Like this one we're creating has kind of specific. Has inputs coming in and it has a specific formula. So I think that one you would have to create for somebody, but it's just a thought in terms of creating other cuts of the data. Like a reporting tool where you can just add in what you want and take out what you don't want.

13:34 - Nazif Barassounon 
I think there's a way to hide some column or include it. So I think it's doable, yeah.

13:45 - Jared Cairns 
I would say not a priority right now, just something I was just thinking about.

13:49 - Jorge Lewis 
This thing you're talking about, is it? So how we're on the implementation side, what we can do is, have just a super big table and the users just select which columns to show? Because you're basically saying start with everything and then kind of start with all the columns and then just yeah they sell they're not going to filter it down but they're going to include which ones they want to make it look like they're like in terms of the data is that would that work?

14:16 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah I'm thinking it would be formatted a little bit differently than the way it is in this one because you would basically have the columns being the dates, like you'd basically be trying to see a trend over six months. And then the vendors would be in the rows. And basically the total that they bill you every single month. But I think what you're saying, Jorge is probably a good start.

14:42 - Jared Cairns 
I would say that's not a high priority. Just if it's something that's easy to throw together, I feel like that can be valuable. Don't worry about it. Just spitballing ideas at this point.

14:52 - Jorge Lewis 
We can touch back on that after the reporting thing is done. Okay, all right. And then go from there.

14:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

15:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool, cool.

15:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that should... Was that the last one?

15:10 - Jared Cairns 
Let's see. Anything else in here? I think that's the last one.

15:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just modifying what happens if the build gets rejected. Actually, how hard is it to implement a draft like a just add a draft is a draft a column for our bills it's it's pretty easy no shoot up because what I'm also yeah I can also I can also envision that When a bill gets rejected, it goes into the system, but it just gets marked as draft. Yeah, that's kind of, yeah.

16:27 - Nazif Barassounon 
Editable, maybe a boolean that states editable.

16:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, what's the term used for, so if the bill gets rejected, what do you call it?

16:45 - Jared Cairns 
So I've seen it called, I've seen it just called rejected. But you could say like, I've seen a call, it's usually called like, if somebody is actively rejected it and nobody's touched it, it's called rejected. If it's waiting for somebody to do it, if it's been submitted, but just not approved yet, then it's pending approval. It's kind of how I've seen the two split up.

17:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so rejected bills, like they always have to be done again. Yeah, because unless someone dialed the bill.

17:19 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, unless you like the one thing that people do sometimes is like you'll enter a duplicate bill or you'll enter a statement and then it's like, okay, in that case, it should be rejected and then like actually deleted. Yeah, so maybe there's a delete button as well, because there's really no risk in deleting it. If it's just a draft, you could just enter it again. Or you can delete it if it's like bullshit. So if that's that could be an option to basically declutter your system.

17:56 - Nazif Barassounon 
Because what I'm seeing here is that a rejection could be one of two things. Either it is something that needs to be deleted or updated. So.

18:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:11 - Nazif Barassounon 
Yeah, that seems right.

18:14 - Nazif Barassounon 
So we need to differentiate the two use cases in some way.

18:23 - Jared Cairns 
This is why I-.

18:32 - Jared Cairns 
Could you give an option to the person who submitted it in the first place to delete it at any point before it's approved, like just as a third option, like delete, submit, edit, whatever. Because then, then they can edit it and then they can choose. They can either it gets rejected, it's back to them. They can say, Oh, I fucked up. This shouldn't even be in the system, delete or edit and then resubmit. And then they have, you don't have to worry about logic breaking. You can put the impetus on some person.

19:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

19:11 - Nazif Barassounon 
I think the approver can actually, so what you're seeing here is that the one who entered the bill could, before it reached the approver, realize that he made an error and delete it. Is that right?

19:31 - Jared Cairns 
Yeah, because there's really no risk in doing that as long as it's not, as long as it has not reached the approval state.

19:42 - Nazif Barassounon 
Okay. So on the approver side, the approver can also request that the bill to be deleted or updated, right?

19:56 - Jared Cairns 
Yes. So if they're like, this is wrong, this is the wrong vendor, this is the wrong amount, then I would just say for them, it's always just a reject option. And then that reject could be, it just puts it back to a rejected state. For whatever reason. And then the person who originally entered it, they make the decision to either resubmit it or delete it.

20:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

20:21 - Jared Cairns 
Cause then that's pretty typical and it gives you the most flexibility I think. And plus it provides a longer manual audit trail later, which is also more beneficial.

20:36 - Nazif Barassounon 
Makes sense.

20:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool, cool.

20:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Alrighty.

20:47 - Jorge Lewis 
That should be it, I think. What do you guys think?

20:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Should be, yeah.

21:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So before we say done, so let's finish the call and then take another look or two everybody and then if anything's missing, we can bring it up. And once all the implementation is done, I can just copy it to scope for the summary.

21:20 - Jared Cairns 
Okay.

21:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool.

21:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, once that's done, hopefully by end of today, I'll send the new contract with the invoice.

21:32 - Jared Cairns 
Okay, do you need me to say like, I approve the scope or anything? Or are you guys just going to look at it internally?

21:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the contract will refer to it as Exhibit A and it'll be attached there. Okay, cool. And then you just email us back with the signed contract. Okay, gotcha.

21:52 - Jorge Lewis 
I got it. Cool, cool. It sounds good.

21:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks so much for your time, man. Have a good night. And thanks for joining us. I'll see you guys later.

21:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'll see you guys.

22:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Take it easy, guys.

22:02 - Jorge Lewis 
You too. Bye-bye.""","Spec overview pt 2 Transcript.txt"

Mon, May 6, 2024

0:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Thank you all for coming. Then we've got the microwave, and then the computer.

1:34 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
you you big hubs for the week so Yeah, I can tell you what I have in my notes, what strategies we could go forward with, what I think is the best solution. I have notes about the competitors that you have listed. I can give you all that. And yeah, you can just decide what to go forward with. I also, yeah, because next week we want to go on with the postal rally, right? So I do have some ideas for the posts. Well, that's it, I think. I mean, I don't think there's much talking... We will present the team, I want to present the company a bit, but I wouldn't focus on selling so much. That's the key point. To gain traction, to gain followers early on is when you share your posts in groups and you can't really do it when you are making an ad, right? I think it will flow more naturally as we talk about posts, I mean we work together and then I get to know everything in and out, right? Because it's just natural, I won't have to, you know, just try to, yeah, like learn everything in one go, right, because it doesn't make any sense, it doesn't be knowledge. So, what I would like to do, and I think we would both benefit from it, is that we work on posts together, I mean, I come up with ideas, we discuss the ideas, and then I just do the copywriting. So I make it the best post possible. I can send it to you later for verification, right? So what I would talk about firstly are some organizational matters, I would say. I mean, the first thing that has to be addressed, right, is the way of people contacting you. Because if you want people contacting you through website, through your email, you need to fix the website. That's a big problem.

6:51 - Jorge Lewis 
It should be ready now, actually. Let me double-check. But we've already added the contact section to the website, the pricing, and updated some of the sections. So, it should be good by two minutes, and we can check it out after it's up.

7:36 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
goal is to focus on social media, to focus on the content so that it leads to the social media, right? So that would be the focus. Work on that's in my notes but you know it's probably sometime else in the future. Okay, so I think this is done. Yeah, so then I want to talk about the topic ideas concerning the articles themselves. So, what is amazing, what sells great is those are people's experience, right? I'm guessing that at this point you cannot provide any kind of human experiences, human stories.

8:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Like that?

8:52 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Could we share it, just change the name, or anonymize everything? Could we make this a lot easier?

8:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it, um, cause I think he likes... No, mine will change his name, so is that something that's usually better or better anonymous? Like, completely unethical?

9:21 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
What I was thinking is coming up with a list of top 10, because list articles are amazing when it comes to visibility, so just top 10 mistakes made by non-tech funders, something like this, then I could reach out to the guy I know, maybe he would want to be a part of this article.

9:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you use Google a lot? Like, their tools, their apps? Google Docs, you know, you use it on a daily basis. Yeah, I use Google Docs all the time, like Google Drive and everything.

10:41 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
I would do it. I will send you a list of my 10 I will come up with after research. I'm not sure if I can manage today, but tomorrow definitely. Then we will bounce some ideas, come up with a final list.

11:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Buh-bye!

12:25 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
That's kind of an aggressive strategy and sometimes this kind of marketing is not beneficial. But if we do it in a calm, toned down way, that's definitely something I would go forward with. So that's one of the types of content, of articles we want to rotate it with some educational content, right? So what I would start is with, you know, explaining some notions that non-technical funders may be not familiar with. Maybe, I mean, they have definitely heard about, I know, technical debt, for example, but we can go deeper into it, you know, explain what exactly does it mean for them and why they should avoid it, why they should be afraid of it. Being educational, and what's amazing, you can actually share these articles on groups have a bunch of technologies listed there and a lot of people, non-tech funders will go in there and will have no idea what that's about, why should I choose TypeScript, why I shouldn't go with something else, right? So explain one by one and maybe all of them, one article, maybe devote one article to each of them, that's something to be discussed and then compare some of them, say when each one of them is better. So that's just something. As I said, rotated and we have to know what's the article about in advance so that the rest of the posts that we post this week are cohesive.

14:06 - Jorge Lewis 
As cohesive as possible.

14:07 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
I mean, we don't want to talk about the same thing for the whole week, but to repeat stuff is good. When it comes to the posts, oh yeah, when it comes to the tone of the articles, where are you thinking of something? Like tone, voice, everything. I would like to, I mean I have my own idea.

15:06 - Jorge Lewis 
BUS!

15:21 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
and passwords and stuff like this because that's what AI does right now. So what I opt for is a very human voice right now. Kind of like a YouTuber mixed with Hemingway. So you're trying to be as short as possible, you're trying to be human and actually talk to people and not trying to be all smart and useless because no one will understand you. You're also aiming at people from different countries. Soon comes use words like I don't know kerfuffle or whatever because no one will understand you make it clearly AI-made, right? You actually have some of them in your copy on the website as well. But it's also that I sent to Farfetch, I believe, which I think is something more or less I would go for. Maybe just a bit of sarcasm here and there. There are also two ways we can go, right? We can either embrace the LinkedIn jerking cycle or we can go away from it, right? You can say something like, people are doing this, but if we say that, well, those people are apes, try to the first try. In the first week, I would like to make a post presenting the company itself, you know, follow with an infographic with highlights. I will also do this. And then, so the first week, actually, I would go with the post presenting the website, then pin it, I mean, presenting the company, then pin it to your social media, to your LinkedIn, so that it stays there. Top ten mistakes. On Friday I made something, I actually wrote it down, I lost it. Jesus Christ, why is my writing so chaotic sometimes? So look between the letters on your keyboard, you probably saw that. Pretty annoying but also pretty funny at the same time. Look between Q and R on your keyboard, that's who can help you with those issues. So a little bit of a nod, but a bit light-hearted and funny. And that's kind of a scheme I would like to roll with for a few next weeks until we get what works and what doesn't. So Tuesday, present the team one by one, if you're okay with that. Just a few questions you're going to answer, like what's your position at the company, obviously experience, the thing you're the proudest of, Good things to do because of our business. Be honest and funny, but not reckless. Do not go into being funny too much, like I think Sam Rush does on the business side. I love the guys, but still. So yeah, the presenting thing, then the article, and Friday either a tech tip or something a bit on the funnier side. I would also rotate it a bit. Yeah, just check in a month what works. You can tell me. Yeah, if there's a threat, obviously we're jumping on it. If there's a way to attack anyone, we're doing it. I would say it takes longer when it comes to the word count. The important thing is to have a good relation with the person who's editing that, obviously.

22:52 - Jorge Lewis 
But if I would have ended, that would take me like the whole day probably for one group. But I mean, I can do it.

23:00 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
I did it and that's not a problem really. And also, you don't have to hire anyone for voiceovers because that's practically, you know, The main problem that they face is well, first of all, it's a I copy that people are really allergic to, you know, And the second thing is that they're not being concrete enough. They're being very vague. That's also something you have in your copy, is that you're not exactly saying what you're offering. One can get lost in what's in that and have no idea what it's about. So, yeah, being concrete is definitely something. We're going to be writing this first post as well. Oh yeah, also I have written down is that, yeah, setting cheat sheets, you know, anything that people can say on the drive is precious. My notes are a bit chaotic but, you know, more of a writing thing than I was going. Oh yeah, also commenting, I was thinking, yeah, about a bit of casual witty but Normally, I just look manually. I've never used tools, you know, competitor research, especially because I think the niche you're working on is not really rich and full of effort. That's how I would sum it up, I think. One of the links also that you had in your competitors, right? I don't think they worked because the link to the meeting didn't work. You couldn't set up a meeting yet. Not with the content itself and the post itself, just describe what I mean. I will forward it to you and yeah, we can just bounce ideas, I'm guessing.

27:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, is that Google Doc or Google Calendar?

27:39 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Usually I just put it on a Google Doc. Yeah, I mean, I know what you mean. I tried using it briefly, but the company I work with right now, they didn't care about the content, so it was just for me. I can as well have it on Google Doc, because I also have it in my mind. Sure, I can set it up in Google Calendar.

28:09 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, it's up to you. I'm just suggesting. Maybe it will be helpful.

28:15 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Although, if we are to have a discussion on the content, it's much better on Google Doc, because you can comment. Usually I don't do a lot of calls, but if you are bored and want to have a chat once in a while, I'm fine with weekly. I could report what is going on, but at the beginning it will probably be very little. From the United States. So when I'm going to be putting the content calendar together, let's do it like this. Let's do Google Docs with dates. It will be a little hard to read, but will allow us for more conversations. And then when we set up ideas, I will make a calendar. Sometimes I will just write something like a hint here, just because I will give myself the time to think of a hint and I will share it with you, okay? Yeah, sounds good.

30:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Great. So, I think that's it.

30:41 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Oh, when it comes to payments, I will just send you a voice if that's alright with you.

30:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, bank transfer could be PayPal, whatever you prefer really, it doesn't matter. Okay, do you take crypto? Oh, I would rather not. Okay, okay. Okay, so I think we'll probably just do a bank transfer for PayPal, so I'll let you know. Just let me know what you think of that, we'll get started.

31:11 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Okay, yeah, I mean for this week we are on the, that will be a surprise, I mean we're going to be, we're going to be calculating for three weeks, right? I will calculate the payment only for two weeks of work in this month. Because we will be posting content for two weeks. I feel like this is honest.

31:46 - Jorge Lewis 
No, that's what I mean.

31:52 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
This month I want to do it for half a month. Because I will be working for half a month only. I usually do the last just because I do have to confirm the invoice Sorry for the chaos by the way Are you stressed about it? Honestly, how do you feel about it, you know, starting to post content?

32:43 - Jorge Lewis 
If I could ask you for something I actually forgotten about is that because any posts with human beings help human beings help.

33:10 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
So if we could think of something like, do you attend any events? Are you meeting up together, the whole of you, or not? Are you just working remotely? Yeah, yeah, your whole team. From a meeting, do you have game nights together or not? Experience because I used to work for a gaming studio. We used to play games Friday nights, it was for some of us, or Sunday Is there anyone who could say something about yourself, a quote, anything? Any kind of pre-testimonial, let's say.

36:02 - Jorge Lewis 
with very good LinkedIn professionals.

36:38 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
It's way more probable they would trust you if you have something like this. If there are people, as you said, LinkedIn professionals that can comment, that can share the post, that will also be a tremendous help. If you feel like asking them, like you can ask them to do it. I don't know what you're doing just yet so I'm not sure how I can improve it but I mean if you were to need someone to edit your message like you're doing some inbound calls or whatever doing some cold messaging I could take a look at that. I think I think that's Alexandru Stantek I sent to you. It's actually a great idea of what people love. He's the guy that provides very little content, very little educational content. It's just being annoying for most of the people, but actually it works for founders because he just educational stuff, but he just posts just people, pictures of people.

38:45 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's kind of like that.

38:46 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
I would say, yeah, it's also argued more this way, that if you post people, it's actually more probable to be high. If you go to, I don't know, Quest website or whatever, sold with the top posts, you're going to be probably think of that's a bit of homework as to say one more thing is that did you buy happens is that when you log in it will just throw me out vice versa so it doesn't really matter and the other thing is that do you want me to post, do you want me to be an admin on your LinkedIn

39:48 - Jorge Lewis 
business page or do you want me to forward you the post and just post it your I can see the messages but the extra thing is that at the beginning what's a great idea to gain followers is that you

40:03 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
go on a group, you invite a bunch of people that you think may like your next post and you just invite them to follow the page when they accept your request. So I can also do that when I'm an admin, but that's up to you, obviously, if you don't want me to see the messages. I think there is a way, because I never made anyone an admin or whatever, I was just made an admin. There could be a way to just restrict some access.

40:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, restrict access to messages and just allow me to post and see the It's gonna take me a while to figure out. Do you know how I can go to the... I'm like on the company page, but I can't see how to add people. Manage add-ins, there we go. So, let me know if you guys have found that there's any lack of permissions there. I've added you. Alright, let me send in chat here. So this is the password.

42:18 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
I always admire people who have passwords like this. Huh, sorry? I always admire people who have passwords like this and actually remember them, not have them saved in some kind of app or whatever.

42:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that is, um, important, so. Got it. Password manager. Cool! You see? Poland's better sometimes.

42:50 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Now I wish I was in Thailand right now.

42:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I can go to a river, you know, there's a river nearby.

43:18 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Actually, I would have to look up because the temperature in this room, I mean, right now, it's usually lower. It's 21 centigrade.

43:29 - Jorge Lewis 
21. That's pretty nice. That's amazing.

43:32 - Tomasz Chwesewicz 
Yeah, probably will be terrible. Okay, so we are all set up. Yeah, whatever comes up, we'll just talk about it, I guess. Whatever you need, I'm here. Working together actually as I said, it's amazing. I've talked to people who believe in marketing despite being technical Okay, so I will send you I will send you this few articles You can take a look at them. You can say which one of them do you think works for you the best? Don't voice and style not the content itself Jesus.""","Tomasz x Jorge - Planning content strat  Transcript.txt"

Tue, Jun 4, 2024

0:08 - Jorge Lewis 
How are you?

0:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, it's up early. Probably bit frustrated with that call.

0:21 - Cuan Mulligan 
So I'm trying to go through this now. I'm just trying to write it up now. Give me a second.

0:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll give it a head set.

0:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
There's a profile to check.

0:45 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just to do, go to there, just reduce all this down.

0:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
And then, Do, so let's say this is last to tell item status, tracker, so distance, time, calories, okay.

1:37 - Cuan Mulligan 
So, what are you working on?

1:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm trying to do a conversation so that we can move beyond just us having back and forward words. Okay. Because it's not, the text doesn't work as a backwards and forwards conversation. I don't know if you can see my screen.

2:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I should put this in a different color. So the blue box is the profile of a user that has a number of tracking items, let's say walk distance or fan calories.

2:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
When this is fully built, later on, the user may have put some in or may not put some in. So it will be variable from day to day whether the user has, one, done the activity, or, B, then filled in the data. Because they could go to the website and just fill it in. Or they could just proactively say, hey, I've just done my walk to the bot, and the bot will fill it in. So there's a nature of proactiveness. But let's say they haven't done anything.

2:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
They've not filled any of them in. Now, if they've not filled them in, we don't know whether they've done them or whether they have done them, but just didn't fill it in. So there's those two steps. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So what you're saying, Yonah, so the user presses the button to start, the bot needs to go to the profile to check the tracker status. In this case, in this scenario, there's all three of them. The bot would then say, Hey, um, so this is just one example. So did you do your walk today? It's the first question. And they go, no. OK. So then I go, right, OK. So then there will be some form of a coaching chat. I'm just going to make it sort of overly simple here for now, coaching chat. OK. So then there is the response around the coaching, blah, blah, blah. That finishes. OK.

3:52 - Cuan Mulligan 
What can we do? What can you do today to ensure you get to do your walk tomorrow? I have put it in my calendar to do at 11 AM. OK, great. I will check in with you. Shall I?

4:24 - Cuan Mulligan 
Check in with you beforehand to give you a gentle reminder. Sure, as an example. All right, now I'm not saying this is, I'm just giving you an example of a conversation. I don't think all of these features are gonna be there for this Friday, but for this case then, What I would expect is, is, I'm just going to move this down here. Put these into Amber.

5:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Reminder, which is basically, pre-walk, 10.30 AM, something like that. That'll be a reminder that they do the next day. There you go. Cool. OK, great. How many? I just want to check to check how many calories did you eat today? I'm going to keep it simple. And they said about 1,700. Nice.

5:49 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well done for keeping within your targets. I will update your profile.

6:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
I go over here and that now has 1,700.

6:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
So that's the sort of engagement, the bell has added that in. If you were just saying, Right, I press the button to start. The bot goes, what I heard you say was this. Did you do your walk? So you basically just go, let's get rid of all of this.

6:28 - Cuan Mulligan 
There'd be none of that. So it goes, check the tracker status. Please update your profile.

6:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
because of missing data, user then goes, user goes to UI and fills in.

6:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
And let's say it goes, okay, I've done calories, 1700. Then what does it do? We can hear you.

7:10 - Jorge Lewis 
I could try to speak for Jonas for now.

7:15 - Eksno 
Can you hear me? Yeah, there we go. So all the fields in the tracker or in the profile would be required to be filled in.

7:29 - Eksno 
Basically, just after the UI or user has gone to the UI and filled in everything, it would skip the asking for the information step and just go directly to the coaching step. Because the coaching is like the core of the application.

7:42 - Cuan Mulligan 
If everything's filled in, there is no coaching.

7:45 - Eksno 
If they filled in that they walked for two minutes and they were supposed to walk for an hour that day, then there is coaching. Like, why didn't you walk today? Do you want to send them a reminder? Like that sort of stuff. The value isn't the question for, like, how many calories have you eaten today? The value is what the bot talks about after related to that data, right?

8:08 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, possibly because with every item that you track, you've either gone below us, above us. So you didn't do us. And if you did do us, you either were above us, below us or on us. So you got variations of that. The, the, the, one of the key assumptions we have is by having this check-in where you are asked, how did your sessions go? Did you do them?

8:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
That is the sort of, we're introducing an accountability cycle. So at the moment, if you physically have a phone call with somebody, right? So let's say we're speaking to a client every two weeks. On the call, they're really engaged. And then life takes over for the two weeks in between. Then maybe a day or an hour before the phone call, they go, shit, I've got all that shit to do.

9:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
every 24 hours rather than every two weeks. So the user has that time. So for me, I'm trying to figure out why I'm attached, but I'm very attached to the fact that the bot starts the conversation by figuring out, like, OK, did you do your walk today? No. Or yes.

9:32 - Eksno 
I think if that's the case, then we shouldn't be implementing an interface for the user to enter the data, because that'll just add more work for us to do. And also, if the user does enter the data, we don't get the scenario that you imagine in your head, where it goes like asking for data and more dynamic conversation. It'll be more, it's just coaching based on the data that was given to us.

9:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
Well, no, because there's the scenario where For example, I wake up in the morning and I did 5K in an hour, one hour, for example, and I didn't do calories. I just haven't had time to put my calories in yet. So maybe I did do that in the morning.

10:24 - Eksno 
Yeah, what's the difference then from like when you click like start check-in from just having a pop-up where it's just like, hey, enter these fields. Did you do this like hard-coded compared to the bot asking? With the bot asking, it's more natural and more like, yeah, it feels more like a real conversation. But in practice, the value of the information that comes afterwards, the actual coaching behind the information, I feel will be the same either way. And that's the concept we're trying to prove.

10:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, you're describing a use case. MVPs aren't supposed to fill or suffice for all the use cases, they should be for the primary use cases. Your use case could be implemented later on by inputting half of the data into the input fields, but the primary way into the data is through the chat.

11:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think we're misaligned here. The reason for having the UI at the moment is a testing capability to show variability between, I want to do a check-in when I've entered nothing. I want to do a check-in where I've entered one. I want to do a check-in when I've entered everything. So the point of the UI is a test case variability.

11:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, when the app is up, I should be able to do through the UI or chat because different people have different things. Some people don't want to talk to a bot and they just want to quickly just enter in their data as they go along throughout the day.

11:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
But that's a later issue. For me, the UI for this is a testing inability so I can test different scenarios of no data, some data, all data.

12:07 - Eksno 
I think we're moving past an MVP there where we're trying to account for like every edge case where we could just like force the user to either enter all of the data or none of we can still prove the concept that the bot can handle having none of the data and having to request it. And inherently, if we have that scenario, then in the future, when you want to implement the capability to enter data for a UI, we'll know that it'll work because we know that the bot works without data and can ask for data.

12:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK, I'll buy that. OK, I'll buy that scenario.

12:44 - Eksno 
So for me, it's more of an implementation issue. I'd just like to narrow down what are the essential core values that we're trying to prove that the bot can provide. So implementing a UI and all those different edge cases will just add time until you can start playing with it. And it'll also work for you because you have to prompt engineer more.

13:08 - Jorge Lewis 
I also think you can experiment, the thing you mentioned, I think you can experiment using the chat interface. You just provide some of the data and some of them you don't provide. Because with the chat, with the bots, you'll be able to give data in a pretty flexible way. You'll be able to just say, today I did 1700 calories, 13 KM in 40 minutes. And like, it'll be able to parse it down and you can miss out some of the info the same way you'd miss out purposely in the tracker.

13:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK, so the issue here is that there is only one day, and we don't yet have the ability to look at a user's profile. Maybe they miss every Tuesday, they miss walks.

13:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
Or Friday nights, they blow their calories. But I mean, that's a later stage. That's where we would go next on the coaching is in terms of understanding patterns.

14:10 - Cuan Mulligan 
Thursday, you know, tomorrow, Friday is a really bad day for you. So, you know, let's see what we can do to change it. But that's a later feature. So by Friday, what do you think I should be able to do then?

14:28 - Eksno 
My first interpretation was that all the information was going to be entered through the UI for now, and then the bot would just act and coach based on the information entered through the UI. I haven't evaluated yet how much effort it will be to have all the information entered through the bots or through a conversation yet. But we know it's possible, because that's been done many times before, probably even before LMS.

14:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, so we're Tuesday now. I've tried to, because I feel the last two Fridays we've been misaligned in terms of scope and what's being delivered. So that's why I've taken this step to try and write out this use case. I'm appreciating that we're having the conversation on a Tuesday rather than on a Friday. So that's definitely an improvement, but it feels like either this isn't the right format that I've given it in, But it feels like we're misaligned again, in terms of what's going to be delivered for Friday, because just the bot saying, fill these boxes in, is not a conversation.

15:37 - Eksno 
That would be like free to check and it wouldn't be the bot, it would just be a UI where the user enters the information and then it goes on to a dynamic conversation with the bots about the information that was given.

15:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
The act of getting the information is the start of the conversation.

15:54 - Eksno 
Okay, then I don't think there's a value to having a UI for entering the information yet. I think we should just focus on having the bots get the information.

16:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think so as well.

16:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, that's what you said earlier on. That's what I agreed with when you said, actually, if we just assume all of them to be empty, that caters for all scenarios by default.

16:17 - Eksno 
Yeah.

16:18 - Eksno 
That makes sense to me.

16:19 - Eksno 
Then that lessens the amount of work we have to do because then there's less scenarios for us to have to account for at this stage of development.

16:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

16:29 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, of course, if we finish a day earlier, we could add it in, right? We want to prioritize, we need to set priorities for the things that are necessary.

16:41 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. Um, okay, cool. Right.

16:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Well, um, could you send again that Google sheet that you sent with a sample conversations with your, the one that you did with your wife where you guys acted as a ball?

17:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Uh, shit. Where is that one?

17:05 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I can find it.

17:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, yep. I'll send it in the group chat.

17:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. I need to jump off, folks.

17:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep. Thanks, Kevin. We'll see you later.

17:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Take care.

17:54 - Eksno

Wed, Aug 7, 2024

0:04 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so let's do the, what do I wanna work on today? The signup stuff?

0:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so wait, let me just finish this up. I'm just gonna be removing this.

0:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so just a rundown on my code. So basically, this is a really simple prototype right now that I'm working on. In the sign-in, what was discussed is that we're going to be using passwordless kind of authentication.

0:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
assume that we're going to be using OTP. So the way I did it is I created basically the status.

0:58 - Jorge Lewis 
But have you discussed? So for each feature, we've kind of concluded that we should be discussing with the client for each small feature to make sure all these small things are clarified. Right.

1:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
All right. We discussed this with Q1, I think.

1:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
days ago before we even finished the scope. Basically, what Q1 wants here is that it's going to be passwordless and not done along with the chatbot, like a separate UI for the sign-in.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't want to interrupt the pair programming session, but just so that we make sure we don't work on something that we won't use. There's two sections to the user authentication with Adapt. The first one is the anonymous authentication where there's no required credentials or input from the user. And the second is a sign up page where after they've completed the workshop, they can sign up. Right? So far so good?

2:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep.

2:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And then you're telling me that you guys said you're going to use single SSO for the signup page. Yeah.

2:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah?

2:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

2:37 - Jorge Lewis 
But what about, so has he said we, so are we not going to use Google authentication or Facebook authentication or?

2:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually, we haven't discussed this.

2:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Because Superbase gives those to us, and it's surprisingly easy to integrate. I think we should be- Okay, okay. Yeah, wait, I'll- No, no, I gotcha, I gotcha.

3:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, okay.

3:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's, let's, um...

3:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's...

3:11 - Jorge Lewis 
See...

3:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's ask him, then.

3:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So, ask him in AdaptDev at Kuen and say, hey, I'm working on the sign-up thing or the user authentication now. What do you want to include? So, the options are this, this, and this. Make sure to include kind of how the user experience is for each. So, for a Google sign-on, or Google sign up, what that means is that they can sign in, they click, maybe you can send some examples, kind of, you click the Google sign up, sign up with Google, it takes, it opens the pop up of Google and they click their Google account and it's in. Explain that to him, because I don't know, he probably knows, but I think it's good to illustrate with examples. Because like for example, JP probably won't know, so we want to kind of pretend Kuin doesn't know any technical things, but he does.

4:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm messaging him right now.

4:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you done any OAuth authentication with Superbase?

4:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
To be honest, no.

4:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think the authentication that I did was on Firebase.

4:48 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's fine, bro. Don't worry. I don't need know-it-alls. I need fast learn.

4:56 - Jorge Lewis 
OK. And on Firebase, was that single sign-on or was that using Google or?

5:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I did an option wherein I tried Google Authentication, and then what I'm slightly more familiar with is using the email and password to sign in.

5:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello? Sorry?

5:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, me too.

5:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Ok.

5:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I've only done email and password and then I think anonymous as well. There's actually a project we, I've only done email and anonymous as well. We have a project, we have a project, IT, you know, actually, are you aware, like, do you know ITNO?

6:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Artino, I saw it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. When I searched Artino, Artino came up.

6:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Right there?

6:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, hello. My mic is not picking up, but I saw Artino one time, I think, in the messages while searching for something.

6:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I, yeah, yeah.

6:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Aetino is our AI project we worked on before. It was kind of a multi-agent builder kind of thing and it was actually a great idea. We were on the right track, definitely.

6:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would like to stop you first. I think I'm hearing Jonas in Gather.

6:48 - Jorge Lewis 
It was just, yeah. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish it. But actually, fortunately, yeah.

6:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Oh, he's here, yeah.

7:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm a me and Google me. You you Alright, alright. I'm back. He's gone.

10:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, alright. Okay, okay. Wait. I'll be... I'll just finish messaging Kuan's sign-in with one-time email. Password userwillsprofile and set the Half of our programming one-on-one is just basically consulting with other people.

15:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Hopefully people stop joining us now.

15:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
You were saying something?

15:35 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no. Go on.

15:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Anyways, so maybe we can put this on hold. I still have one issue that I'm working on, though, related to the anonymous sign-ins that I might need some help with.

15:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Maybe that's something I can do other than the sign-up page while clarifying some things with Q1.

16:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, what would be good is if you send a video, a little short video, Google, for example. You don't have to make one, but just searching online.

16:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So we can see the user flow.

16:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, anyways, sorry. There was some noise out there.

16:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Google search a video on how the user flow works, right? I think it's going to be a bit easier. Yeah.

17:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I'll just search on YouTube right now.

17:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'm trying to find one as well.

17:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I found a good example. Could you also edit your message to mention that we can include multiple of the options.

17:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, thank you. Including this right now, yes, we can have multiple options.

18:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, there we go.

18:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Where did you find this? Just Google Images?

18:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I just searched Google OAuth example. Oh, nice.

18:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think with the exception of Google Auth and Meta Auth, everything's self-explanatory already.

18:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay, so, but what I actually think is we're going to put yourself in his shoes. We ask him, hey, do you want this or this or this or do you want all of them? He's going to say, why would I, why would I not? Yeah, exactly. Why would he not say all of them for him? It costs the same. Um, since for us, like realistically the time to implement more than one should maybe take one or two more hours. Um, which should be a positive, um, ROI for us since the client gets to be really happy and, um, and we can reuse that code. So, sorry, sorry. Not reuse his code. Um, create it from scratch.

19:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Our meetings aren't going to be read by him anyways, it's okay. We can...

19:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Code like this isn't his IP actually, or the client's IP, because it's so generic that it's used in every single SaaS project, so it's not exactly his IP. So we can reuse the code.

19:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think only the workshops might be a little bit... On the gray area of what's good and what's not.

19:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for sure.

19:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Okay.

20:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
While we're waiting, go on.

20:04 - Jorge Lewis 
We can get into making all the authentication options, I think.

20:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Wait.

20:13 - Jorge Lewis 
If you can share your whole screen and we can, because you're using the documentation on a browser here.

20:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Mm-hmm.

20:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so you can share your whole screen. I can follow along with the docs that you're looking at.

20:29 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

20:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me just clean up my tabs.

20:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There we go, all nice and clean. Mm-hmm.

20:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Stop presenting.

20:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK. Let's test this on superbase. Superbase hot documentation.

21:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait.

21:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If we're going to be including multiple ways to sign in, then here in the architecture, the sign-in page should have multiple pages, right? Like sign-in. There's going to be a sign-in page. And then if, let's say, the user opts for an OTP, well, I'm going to be creating another OTP page.

21:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Let me share with you the code of the other project of Aetina where we did the Google authentication. We did Google and GitHub authentication for that project.

21:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, okay.

22:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have access to the Aetina repository?

22:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think I have access already to... Wait, I'm just going to be yanking this.

22:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh yeah, I think I have access to this 13 repositories already. All right, perfect. Let me double check. I might be wrong.

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I sent you a link as well if you need it.

22:36 - Jorge Lewis 
And Discord, sorry.

22:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, here we go.

22:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Repositories, Aitino.

22:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go. This is a public? Okay.

22:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, it's public. Do you have access to... Oh, actually, no, you just need to read it, yeah?

23:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So, yeah, I don't know...

23:11 - Jorge Lewis 
My God, stop.

23:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, here we go.

23:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I will data form form that register.

23:34 - Jorge Lewis 
How about this? Um, so it's this, this off, it takes a lot of learning. And I think the pair programming sessions while sometimes you probably do want to do learning together. I think a more efficient, especially since we're just starting off with these sessions, is by actually writing some code. So I think what we can do is we can work on the, remember that to-do toggle, or that done toggle that I told you about on Peres, the Read.AI project? Could we work on that instead?

23:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh yeah, wait, wait, wait.

24:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me pull it then. Repositories.

24:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Read.AI tool.

24:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, are you okay with extending it, like, 15 minutes, given the, you know?

24:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, for sure. I should be able to. I just have a couple meetings with some people, but it should be good, if you want.

24:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

24:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Reddit, tool, tmux, new, s, reddit, tool, tntm, install, And then, no package manage, oh yeah, right, right, cduel.

25:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, wait, are we using, what are we using here?

25:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In order for me to test this app properly, I have to do some CSRF.

25:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Show config false.

25:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Run dev. Nope.

25:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Run dev.

25:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Very annoyed of you.

25:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Huh.

25:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Unexpected token starting dev server. Okay, got it.

26:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then we're gonna do something in Nginx.

26:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Huh.

26:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Starting dev server.

26:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
New GitHub copilot was found.

26:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I'll just quit everything.

26:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

26:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Clear, clear.

26:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's wrong again?

26:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
svelte.config.js, delete it.

26:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go.

26:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then something within the nginx file, sudo vim etc nginx. It's still wrong.

27:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is there no show config? I might have I might have CSRFs.

27:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, check origin.

27:33 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the CSRF? I've never seen it before.

27:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's basically the course, it's course related because I'm not using localhost.

27:45 - Jorge Lewis 
to run.

27:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm basically hosting this in another server, in a Vultr cloud server. That's why I can use it from any device as long as I remember the password.

28:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Which I actually am starting to forget now. What's the name again? Checkorigin.

28:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Check origin. There we go.

28:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And I know this is going to work now because I am a god. So it's available.

28:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Default. Now I have to.

28:38 - Jorge Lewis 
This is Windows, so.

28:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, RIP. I'm prompt. You should be using at least PowerShell.

28:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Really?

28:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I prefer using PowerShell, but also WSL works. Like, do you have WSL?

29:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually...

29:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I haven't really used it though.

29:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
5, 1, I just got used to 7, ordinary shell commands. 5.

29:31 - Jorge Lewis 
But your vulture is Linux.

29:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Let me try to center my thoughts first. I was really focused on doing the ng-stuff. What was the question again?

29:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Why don't you use WSM?

29:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, right. It's because I keep on forgetting to initialize them, to like start them.

30:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Gotcha.

30:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I don't, I can't imagine working with commando prompts, but I mean, if you're used to it, then it works.

30:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, that's. Actually, that's what's been changing with me recently. My whole mentality is if it works, it works, but I am slightly learning that maybe that's a wrong way of doing things.

30:28 - Jorge Lewis 
It seems like a balance. For me, when I tried switching to NeoVim, or a better example is I tried switching to Linux, to NixOS, but it's more sexy, it's more flashy. It's like, oh, I use Linux, I use NixOS. I use Vim, by the way, but it just doesn't work for me. What works for me is Windows, because of what I do. It's all very dependent on what you do.

30:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That's fair.

31:00 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, I can work so much more efficiently with...

31:06 - Jorge Lewis 
That happens to me all the time as well. I keep opening those random Windows apps.

31:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I also... This is why I'm really gonna change this to... I'm gonna change this to Linux probably tomorrow.

31:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This is a bit...

31:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Annoying to... Yeah, maybe like for most people, for me, I should start on trying new things more often.

31:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's the tough thing. It's like what works, works is great. But then learning to like growing is just trying these new things that make you feel uncomfortable. Like it was super uncomfortable for me to learn NeoVim, but I learned it. I tried it and it just doesn't work. Like now I know at least. So if people say, oh, you should use NeoVim. I can say, oh, I did. Because a lot of things, when people say, oh, use NeoVim, or sorry, use Vim at least, it's just because they heard Providion say it once and twice and ten times, and now they're just robots saying, oh, use Vim. Use Linux.

32:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Wait, what's the name of the env file again? This is it, right? The public super base URL.

32:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, are you... Let me send you the new one because... Okay. U.S. Edited it a little bit.

32:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I remember. Go ahead. There's just this aspect.

32:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, make sure you pull from Alpha because I've been making some changes. Alright, so I'm saying Google Meets. There's just one more variable.

32:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I'm in Alpha.

33:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Um...

33:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, public base URL localhost 8080, okay.

33:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, viewers had a little bit of a confusion with some of the variables and what they were doing, but yeah.

33:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I think this can work now.

33:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let's see.

33:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, you might need...

33:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm.

33:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Go to app. Oh, now it works.

33:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's see.

33:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's see indeed. OK.

33:58 - Jorge Lewis 
And one thing I've actually noticed that I'm not going to make a conclusion yet or an opinion on yet, I think a hypothesis I have is that people use Vim and Linux to be more efficient. But what I've noticed is that it's contrary because when I'm watching people code on Windows and code on Linux, the people that code on Windows are less flashy, they're using their mouse, maybe they type a little bit slower, but they're more efficient. So it's a hypothesis that I have that people that use Linux blindly because it's better or it's more efficient end up kind of shooting themselves in the foot. It's a hypothesis I have.

34:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's because the value is so like, like the learning curve is a lot, lot harder than it looks. That's why you have to spend literally like two to three years. In order to actually be 1.5 times better than the average dev.

35:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Most people, the best companies in the world don't use Linux, they use Windows.

35:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Using Linux doesn't make you a better developer, doesn't make you a better engineer. It's supposed to make you more efficient but what do engineers need to be more efficient? They don't need to type 1.5 times faster, typing isn't the problem. CDing into the right repository isn't the problem. Using a text-only IDE isn't the problem.

35:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually, that's something I think that's where we would disagree. However, something we could agree on is that if you just follow trends blindly without considering your personal circumstances, you're really going to shoot yourself in the foot. And also, what's the key? I mean, like, yeah, for some people, VS Code works for them. For some, doing Linux, Vim, and all that stuff works for them, because they've custom made it for their specific circumstances. So it makes perfect sense that they're going to be better developers.

36:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But it's interesting. Go on.

36:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, I see a lot of people just use Vim, use Linux for the reason that their influencers did it without much research and they're having plenty of problems because they did not expect that they're going to be making some sacrifices along the way.

36:52 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a good reason. I agree with that. To get good at Linux, you need to dedicate specific time to be good at Linux and Vim and stuff like that. It's not something that you learn over time, it's something that you need to learn, you need to actually do it. And which most people don't do because they have other things to do. For me, I can't spend time, me personally, it's on a person-to-person basis. I have business calls to get to, I can't be saying, sorry, let me SSH into my Google Meet server or something like that.

37:28 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, it doesn't work. For me, I'm a unique person, but for other unique people, it also doesn't work for them. They have to work. If you're in school, I would definitely recommend learning Linux because why not? That's growth. You don't have to end up using it in your career, but learning it is great. Learning things is always great.

37:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What did I do here again? So basically, we're just going to add another column here, right?

38:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, pretty much add a column and then connect it to the database.

38:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, I remember, let me just review the super base types again. Oops.

38:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So where is to do?

38:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
One is to one.

38:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is this updated? I don't think so.

38:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, sometimes it's not a matter of this or that. Sometimes it's a matter of this and that. Like, I use a Vim, I use a NeoVim environment in my VS Code.

39:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, really?

39:04 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a mentality that my friend told me while I was in Thailand. He's like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I've met. It's a matter of, oh, don't use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.

39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's actually a good compromise.

39:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Because in today's world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it's a good kind of reminder. Oh, but trust me, I felt so cool using NeoVim in the airport. In the airplane, I was like, yeah, the people behind me can see me just using Vim. I bet they use Windows. I bet they use VS Code.

40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's this? Exit your status entry.

40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me see the web and px super basic. Yeah, anyways, the problem that I'm trying to fix is basically when determining whether the types here in the superbase.ts are accurate.

40:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I would update them regardless.

40:38 - Jorge Lewis 
They should be, but just, yeah, never hurts. Actually, I can do it for you just to double check in case you're having too many problems.

41:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll Shift-C, Alt-Tab, V, superbase.com, continue with GitHub.

41:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Well done, now close this window. And then...

41:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
We copy, exit, and then...

41:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So we go bash, update superbase tags.

41:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm. Plus x.

42:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There we go. Packages.

42:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Like one thing also that I've noticed, I'm not here to attack Linux users, I like Linux, I do. But one thing that I've noticed is that for people using Vim and Linux, you're often fixing your operating system and your tools rather than developing. I think that's one of the biggest arguments.

42:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's basically a personal attack, but it's accurate to...

42:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Like, fuck you, but like, yeah, that is us.

42:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, the types are updated, so don't worry.

42:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let me try to pull.

42:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, actually, wait, let me push. I have changes here, though.

43:00 - Jorge Lewis 
There's quite a- Bewis is still learning. He's using a lot of tri-catches, so... Prepare your eyes. If you don't, yeah.

43:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, don't worry, I also use tri-catch. If it works, it works.

43:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That has been my mentality. Wait, let me just...

43:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I hate this saying because it's just so cliche, but everything's a balance.

43:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's happening with my... Ah, anyways.

44:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Look at how inefficient you are, you don't have a shortcut to nvim, just vi. Come on.

44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Now my vim is lagging like crazy.

44:14 - Jorge Lewis 
It was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn't set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it's like two characters doesn't make you more efficient, but it's just so funny. I don't know. It's like the inside the head of a developer. We're going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we're satisfied.

44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, that is us.

44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay. I'm just going to pull if there are any changes. Wow. Okay. This is from Alpha 2.

45:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me see what has changed.

45:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm getting a bit dyslexic. Let's see. To do. What's the name of

45:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's done, done.

45:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Done. Oh, okay, okay.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait. Actually, sorry, I think the table that you're, like the table that's showing on the front end there, that's actually the leaps table, not the evaluated submissions table. And I haven't added that done to, The leads table. So I'm going to do that right now. So you're going to have to actually...

45:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That explains it. That explains the issues I'm having. Okay.

45:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh no.

46:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In my other laptop, I was trying to forcibly justify the leads. I was forcibly trying to justify the done table. Okay. I'll wait for it.

46:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I've added it Let me do you have the super base generate command a hand or should I do and push?

46:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you do it?

46:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I got it. Thanks. All right All right, I think I sent it or I pushed it Okay.

46:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Space BD.

46:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm actually going to paste the command in the project so that we have it at hand.

46:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Leads. We have done. Okay. There we go. Lovely.

47:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it is in project. No, no, not projects.

47:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Resizable panel, data table, lead data, deeds.

47:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So where we want to move the button to, so okay, so actually let's think about this. So I actually thought about this as well. What's the, let's take a look at the front end real quick. And instead of trying, there's an easy way and there's a hard way, I realized. So the left side there is a data table. It's using ChefCN. It's pretty complex compared to the right side, which is straight up just very simple stuff. So I realized if we move the button or the toggle to the right side, it'll make things a lot easier. We don't have to worry about the data table stuff.

47:50 - Jorge Lewis 
But if you want to learn more about the data table and how it works, I'm more than happy to.

47:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, cool. I already suffered.

48:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I need to learn a bit more about it as well. But the only thing is I haven't had the time to learn it properly.

48:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, me too. Let me try to remember the last thing I did. Okay, here we go. Basically, I'm going to be copy pasting this.

48:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Since this is a boolean one, create render.

48:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Relative dates. And I'm going to be Copying this one.

48:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Copy relative date. So let's call this relative to do.

48:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, actually, it's actually already there. It's started, I think. Dang it. Okay.

49:03 - Jorge Lewis 
On a general note, I wonder if it's a good practice to suffix the files that are cells, like with a dash cell, I wonder. I don't know.

49:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, it's for readability purposes. It's always a good thing.

49:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's call this then. Let's call the done button. Let's see what happens.

49:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Relative.

49:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, see, for... Do you have GitHub Copilot in general, or...?

49:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Huh?

49:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

49:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have GitHub Copilot?

49:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No.

49:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I am only using a language server here.

50:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
RelativeDateCell... RelativeDateCell... What's the name of this again? DoneButton... ItemValue...

50:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's the, uh... Okay, ID...

50:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Item.ID...

50:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm not sure if actually this is correct.

50:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I think this is lead.

50:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, what is this?

50:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So I actually tried working on this at some point, but I don't know what happens.

51:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let's see. What is data body cell? Data body cell.

51:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Table color, I know you're rendering an item, so the thing I would have to do is find out what contains the lead.

51:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

51:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

51:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Nevermind, that's a dead end. Insert columns, table, create columns, status, assessor, status. Property done does not exist.

51:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Data.

51:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So what's item.value?

52:01 - Jorge Lewis 
What is it? What is...

52:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait. Have you... No, you just... I think it's because you haven't... It hasn't updated your types yet, your ID.

52:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, right, right, right.

52:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Maybe?

52:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to...

52:23 - Jorge Lewis 
You know what's funny? That's the most Vim thing I've seen right there. You have to close the entire IDE to get it refreshed. Vim is just like, oh, it broke. Close it and reopen it.

52:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And this is the IT equivalent of, have you tried turning it on and off? Oh, wait, it is working, huh?

52:47 - Jorge Lewis 
But you changed it to value. Try done. I wonder.

52:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Wait.

52:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I have no clue what value.

52:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There's no error message. OK.

53:01 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you read the type? Can you open the type of value or item?

53:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Not able to do it. Weird.

53:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Try value.

53:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Value extends body cell. Oh, right.

53:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I can see it here. Let me send it to you. Let me send a screenshot.

53:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So item.

53:44 - Jorge Lewis 
This is probably just useful to know about the data table structure.

53:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I sense that's the item data structure, and then here's the value data structure.

53:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, where did you send it? Discord?

54:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Read.AI tool, sorry. Yeah, Discord.

54:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Waiting for... Ah, okay. Read.AI tool, I suppose.

54:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Dang.

54:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Jump to present. Click to jump to present, yeah.

54:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So Jonas just sent a screenshot.

54:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I saw it either way, it's okay.

54:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Value, data body, cell comment, data discovered.

54:33 - Jorge Lewis 
It's the same data type as a lead. So it is a lead but just it's synonymous with the lead but different.

54:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so I was correct. I mean, partially correct.

54:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So you should be able to do item.done. But I think the language server or the type checker, what is it called?

54:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It doesn't like it. Language server.

55:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Item. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yep, yep, I can hear you.

55:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, is he with us?

55:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait.

55:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we're not programming session real quick. We're tired of being bothered. I'll get back to you when we're done in like... 30 minutes-ish?

55:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Is he awake?

55:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, he'll reply to you.

55:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, yeah, could you deal with that? Maybe try.

55:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Screw it, I'll see if it works. I'll refresh.

55:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I see, internal error. Okay, what the hell did I do? What the hell did I do?

56:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Try again, I guess, I don't know, cuz it's a little bit, what even happened?

56:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I don't know, is my server getting half plug-in code VSS did?

56:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Maybe a stop overflow or something, let me try. Item.done. What the fuck is this?

56:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll be right back, I'm gonna use the restroom.

56:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep.

58:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
so let's see let's see let's see prospect username status discover dot header done what did I do wrong So why didn't item.done work?

59:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Both of them did not work. I tried item.done. I'll try to check.

59:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe casting item.done as a boolean?

59:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

59:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, wait. No.

59:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to smash this first.

59:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, get diff. What did I do wrong? What did I change? Okay, the spacings...

59:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I changed the spacings. Oh no, this is not gonna help me.

59:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
God.

1:00:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I have an idea.

1:00:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, restart the server.

1:00:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hopefully.

1:00:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Of course, why did I not check the console logs first?

1:00:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So it's not.

1:00:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I believe it's not the table's fault.

1:00:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Because the error happened even though...

1:00:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, can I see your error again?

1:01:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait.

1:01:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go.

1:01:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I honestly think someone's hacking my phone, right? My AA server right now.

1:01:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here you go, transfer with what error?

1:01:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Look at- look at- go down, go down.

1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So, look at, um... Okay, okay. Look, read the error. Transfer failed with one error. Unexpected character. And it's, uh...

1:01:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let'S see.

1:01:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Superbase TS 1.0. But it's weird because there's nothing wrong there.

1:02:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Or maybe there is. I don't know.

1:02:03 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I'm looking at it on my thing. There's not.

1:02:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm with Will right now in a pair programming session. If you don't mind waiting like 15 minutes.

1:02:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, fine.

1:02:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, thanks.

1:02:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, what's What's my super base looking like then?

1:02:51 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, it's in types. It's in types and then super base. So, yeah, there's nothing wrong with it.

1:02:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm. Okay. I'll try to restart it again then.

1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a problem with byte.yes.build.

1:03:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Dang.

1:03:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, what's htop saying? Is this a Stack Overflow? No, this is not a Stack Overflow problem.

1:03:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How are my other sites?

1:03:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep, this is an isolated event.

1:03:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This is beautiful. I love this.

1:03:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:04:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Web slash super base.

1:04:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I think I might know what happened.

1:04:39 - Jorge Lewis 
I think... I might have...

1:04:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Say... Huh...

1:04:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just...

1:04:50 - Jorge Lewis 
No...

1:04:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me actually just delete it and bring it back.

1:05:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Because what it looks like is something related to the binary, or at least the file of the types doesn't look too happy.

1:05:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In which case, maybe a fresh install would work, fresh pnpm install.

1:05:20 - Jorge Lewis 
A fresh PMPM, at least I'm doing the gen types call first, which did not work. So I guess, yeah, fresh PMPM. But what's, what broke it?

1:05:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's probably related to the done value. Something screwed the server up with that. Now let's try PMPM model.

1:05:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Then let's try it again.

1:06:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think it's working now. Oh no, it's not.

1:06:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This has gotten a bit more interesting.

1:06:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Put in a Read.AI column. Transform failed due to an error. Error when evaluating SSR module.

1:06:48 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

1:06:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Interesting. Evaluation.

1:07:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I need to use another PC for this.

1:07:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
so Okay, I have no idea what's happening Okay.

1:09:48 - Jorge Lewis 
What a strange issue.

1:09:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

1:09:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How about we settle for...

1:09:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually?

1:09:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Go on.

1:09:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Huh. It was running a second ago, right? Like...

1:10:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

1:10:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. I have an inkling into what it might be. Nope, wasn't it? Yeah, nope.

1:10:17 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it doesn't work on mine either. Wait, what? So it's something to do with this new typefile that CibaBase has given us.

1:10:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That's kind of broken something.

1:10:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, at least that's a clue. That's a clue.

1:10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Although it's weirder is that it was working just like a second ago we didn't make any changes on it or we made like a change that I have removed and it's so wait what if we're all back into another

1:11:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
what if you're all back to the previous commit and then just do a git div.

1:11:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Try that.

1:11:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, git div previews.

1:11:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's see.

1:11:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
git div next, git div head with head thing.

1:12:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, but like, I want a good comparison.

1:12:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, the only thing different from the previous commit is the done.

1:12:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

1:12:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
The only thing different from the previous commit is the inclusion of done.

1:12:51 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, I shouldn't do anything.

1:13:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Try deleting it, I guess? Maybe we're like, maybe just, maybe we're just tripping and it's like, just doesn't want to work. It's like, you know, guys.

1:13:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me try it. Okay.

1:13:39 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I deleted done and it doesn't work.

1:13:43 - Jorge Lewis 
It's not that, huh?

1:13:45 - Jorge Lewis 
It's not that, it's like, it's just so weird.

1:13:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, maybe I'll do a blind research of which commit is working.

1:14:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But what it looks like, so the error also says, error when evaluating SSR module, the server file for the home page but I ain't got a clue bro all right well into your trusty hands.

1:14:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, by the way, do we have the scope already for the Read.AI tool? A what? A scope.

1:14:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Scope?

1:14:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, like inclusion of the to-do, like the backlogs.

1:14:53 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, no. I mean, it's just in my head.

1:14:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:14:57 - Jorge Lewis 
I use this on a daily basis for reaching out to people for sales.

1:15:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, there's quite a few things that I would like, but they're all kind of nice to have. It's not really too important. Okay, okay.

1:15:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll try to fix this, if ever, during my date. But it looks like Q1 wants to...

1:15:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think it's more important we go back to work on that. And hopefully, next time we attack this issue on rest, it's gone.

1:15:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Wait, wait. Before you go, Q1 said that they're going to be signing up for the newsletter before the Y experience, so most likely, the users have an account. They're probably going to transfer the account from the newsletter to us. I'm not sure about this.

1:15:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry, say that again?

1:15:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll say this. This is what Q1 had said. Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up. So basically, people from the newsletter would be signing in. Should we do some kind of creating an account if a person came from the newsletter, like the workflow of it?

1:16:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, described, so we're still, I feel like we're still aligned. I feel like he just misinterpreted what we do. So in FigJam, make a user flow of this user process and use these images here. So create a user flow saying, okay, and it's already there online on FigJam. If you open the depth spec, there's actually a section for the user flow, just called discovery. And in that discovery, what you should do is kind of duplicate it. Can you open FigJam?

1:17:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me see.

1:17:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go.

1:17:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So I duplicate the discovery section over here, full user auth flow. In here, search and expand upon it to create the full version with the technical thing. So saying, signs up, replacing that with more in-depth things like how they sign up.

1:17:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then reply to them, yeah.

1:17:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sounds like a plan to me then.

1:17:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, let them know, say, um, that sounds, that sounds right. Let me make a FigDem to make, to double check.

1:18:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:18:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll message them on Discord then. Wait, let me message Kuan now to see if I get what you're saying.

1:18:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Just to make sure that we're also perfectly aligned, I'll be creating a user on how the sign up experience would look like,

1:18:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sounds like a plan.

1:18:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
including again.

1:19:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

1:19:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This looks good to me. Anything else?

1:19:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me check the message out.

1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis 
So your message, it doesn't feel like, so I mean, he says perfect, but for me, it would be even more clear for sure thing. Like that, It just sounds like all you're saying, it sounds like he said something and then all you said was yes. But what does yes mean? Does it mean yes, that's what we have in mind or yes, I'm going to change my mind? Yes, thanks for the clarification. So when we say sure thing, what do you mean by that?

1:19:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I just basically, I'm just basically saying that I understand. I'll keep note of what you've said. That's what I meant by sure thing.

1:20:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But we don't want to be just keeping note. We want to make sure that we can give more than that. So for example, he says, this is what we've discussed. How does that interact with what you guys are planning? It's pointless to say, I understand, just as a first thing.

1:20:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Because there's things that we need to clear up.

1:20:32 - Jorge Lewis 
We can't avoid the conflict of having cleared things up. That's what it feels like, Because there's a conflict which is, we talked about the UX being via the mentor chat with action buttons. Do you understand what he means?

1:20:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think right now, he is talking about the mockups.

1:20:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait.

1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So the answer is no. It doesn't sound like you know what he means. Neither do I. Like, I don't know exactly what he means. So it's, we can't just say yes. We're better off to saying, okay, to make sure that we're aligned. Like don't, because saying it's, um, it's like a false sense of security for him. And it's bad because if he thinks, if it creates an assumption that we understand, and then later down the road, it could bite us in the ass. This one specific example may not be the case, but for things like this, I've definitely seen it happen. I wouldn't be stressing it as much if I didn't see this happen before.

1:21:38 - Jorge Lewis 
If you feel what I'm saying.

1:21:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay. I hear what you're saying.

1:21:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So, what are the improvements that you think I should do, like, It's not on how I voice my messages. I think it's being a bit more inquisitive. Questioning, I suppose.

1:22:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So, of course, it depends on your style then.

1:22:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Mm-hmm.

1:22:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry.

1:22:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think so as well. Like, you know, the very short messages kind of like a lot more lenient. QAnon has very direct messages. You can find your own style. But there's some things that need that all forms of communication from conflicts.

1:22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I would like for me, if this were me, I would, I'm going to type it in your, in our person on the end, but don't, don't kind of, I don't want you to kind of take this as a fact, like just for me, how I would do it, right?

1:23:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, basically I'll just try to get the essence of it and figure out the, how I'm going to write it in my own words.

1:23:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, are you there?

1:23:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep. I think your internet is a little bit I think you cut out by there. Hello, hello. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:23:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

1:23:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello.

1:23:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Can you hear me?

1:23:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep, I can hear you.

1:23:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Is that me? Yes, okay, okay. And then you can use that as inspiration. Everyone has their own style, so don't take it as like a fact.

1:23:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, got it. Looking at it now.

1:23:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

1:24:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold on, my Wi-Fi is literally like...

1:24:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I'll turn off screen sharing for now.

1:24:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Haha, thanks.

1:24:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Man, this is the worst it's been so far. I don't know, bro, I'm in Hong Kong, one of the places with the fastest internet. I don't have like, I can't even do a voice, a video call.

1:24:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Jesus Christ, how much is the internet there?

1:24:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, hello, hello. Can you hear me, Jorge?

1:24:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, bro, it's expensive. All data, right?

1:24:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:24:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, God. We have like 10 seconds delay.

1:24:58 - Jorge Lewis 
It sounds like there's a big delay, though.

1:25:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Maybe we can end this call now. And I work on the user sign-up flow for now in Figma.

1:25:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it better now?

1:25:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Not sure.

1:25:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, have a nice day.

1:25:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye-bye.
