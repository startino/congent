He's like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I've met. It's a matter of, oh, don't use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.\n\n39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's actually a good compromise.\n\n39:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause in today's world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it's a good kind of reminder. Oh, but trust me, I felt so cool using NeoVim in the airport. In the airplane, I was like, yeah, the people behind me can see me just using Vim. I bet they use Windows. I bet they use VS Code.\n\n40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat's this? Exit your status entry.\n\n40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see the web and px super basic. Yeah, anyways, the problem that I'm trying to fix is basically when determining whether the types here in the superbase.ts are accurate.\n\n40:32 - Jorge Lewis \nI would update them regardless.\n\n40:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThey should be, but just, yeah, never hurts. Actually, I can do it for you just to double check in case you're having too many problems.\n\n41:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll Shift-C, Alt-Tab, V, superbase.com, continue with GitHub.\n\n41:16 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWell done, now close this window.

Come on.\n\n44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNow my vim is lagging like crazy.\n\n44:14 - Jorge Lewis \nIt was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn't set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it's like two characters doesn't make you more efficient, but it's just so funny. I don't know. It's like the inside the head of a developer. We're going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we're satisfied.\n\n44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, that is us.\n\n44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, okay.

Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain sayyed \na way to simulate time to control time based on time interval we can have the chatting with the synthetic like per day or one hour two hour maybe maybe even like per 10 minutes right oh yeah 10 minutes Um...\n\n19:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut over here, every synthetic user will have a different kind of personality, right? Like the few short.\n\n20:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I don't understand that part. I don't, I don't think so. Can you, can you kind of keep going?\n\n20:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. So, so like if admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic users, so each user which is created will have a similar kind of personality or like the talking or the chatting way, like the few shots that we are giving to each synthetic user, like the history or data or each synthetic user will have a different kind of knowledge.\n\n20:43 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, they, they should be mostly the same. So like, um, let me come up a little wireframe here. How do I, So we have, so we can give it name.\n\n21:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nWe can give it personality.\n\n21:14 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can give it goal. It's objective. So this, just a little note.\n\n21:25 - Jorge Lewis \nObjective is a behavior of adapt that the synthetic user is trying to test or exploit. What else?\n\n22:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess the profile information, so just the stuff that's in the super base in the profile table. So every user has, so we need to assign it like things like it's goal.\n\n22:32 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me just check. Ah, I'm going to have to sign in. But you get what I mean. Within the profile information, there's their goal, their Y, weight, height.\n\n22:57 - Jorge Lewis \nBasic onboarding.\n\n22:59 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, like all the information we gather from the onboarding, exactly. So what else?\n\n23:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess it's a list that we can copy from onboarding. So I think with that, there's probably going to be things that pop up that we can't see right now, but I think we might as well get started in this development. There's some things we can start on.\n\n23:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n23:30 - Jorge Lewis \nSo one thing, since we're working on the AI stuff only, for creating synthetics users, we can, since we don't want to work on any of the front end, we can just use directly in super base. We can manually create a table and manual create rows. All right. So I'll hand it off to you. Yeah. So we'll, There's different ways pair programming sessions work. You can do like pilot driver or what is it? Driver. I don't know, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you lead the way and I'm going to kind of chime in here and there.\n\n24:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So, uh, what things should I start with? Like\n\n24:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan we just create the flow like the first we will be working on this, then this, then this, because there are multiple things in this module.\n\n24:38 - Jorge Lewis \nLet's create a very basic system. So what do we need in order to simulate a conversation? What is the requirement?\n\n24:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe first thing is data, of course, because, uh, it is a fake user, first of all. So, uh, the table that you have created, we need that then the prompt, uh, the basic few short, like, uh, the knowledge, uh, on the basis of which the fake user will chat with the agent. So that's the main thing. And, uh, uh, the function functionality, like, uh, to automate this thing, uh, because, uh, the API only hits when, uh, event on click event will trigger. So we have to create a functionality for that. Uh, so that, uh, on each day, 10 minutes.\n\n25:24 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, the, the one where we, because the user we're not, we don't have a real user anymore. We're not sending a message. So we have our AI system and we have the user, but we probably use it more. So we're going to have to replace it with the synthetic user.\n\n25:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, correct. So that's what I'm telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.\n\n25:51 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n25:53 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, keep going. Which one?

Yeah, you're on a laptop.\n\n41:01 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I have the same problem. When it's nighttime for me and I put my monitor on like a lower brightness, all the dark UI starts to kind of fade in.\n\n41:15 - Jorge Lewis \nNow we can go into the code and start working.\n\n41:26 - Jorge Lewis \nLet's see what we're missing from this that we might need. We need to tell the agent.\n\n41:35 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need to tell the agent, the synthetic profile, who it is or what its objective is. Because like me as a user, I know what I'm doing. So I think we can add a column for prompts. So if you go to the, if you scroll left a little bit.\n\n41:58 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, yeah, left, left. Yeah, no, the other way, the other way.\n\n42:04 - Jorge Lewis \nMore, more. There's a prompts column that I'm looking for.\n\n42:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, it's there.\n\n42:10 - Jorge Lewis \nSo here, so this column in a real profile is connected to the admin page. But since this synthetic user is not accessing the admin page, I think we can change it. I think we can change the structure of it.\n\n42:28 - Jorge Lewis \nI wonder if Yeah, I think that should be fine. Let's do that. So in the structure of the...\n\n42:42 - Jorge Lewis \nI'll also share my screen, by the way.\n\n42:44 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, please, please.\n\n42:48 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd that way we can just go back and forth.\n\n42:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah. What I'm thinking is...\n\n42:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould we add an option to the admin panel, like, or get a, like, if the flow that we have decided will add a similar kind of user, because we haven't created any option to, you know, change the user character or the few short prompt, whatever. So we can have some options to admin that, like four or five examples, we have to, create that data. And whenever the user clicks on, whenever the admin clicks, like, yeah, I need this character, I need this synthetic user character, maybe like a goal will be different for that synthetic user. Have you got the point?\n\n43:43 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so you see my screen share.\n\n43:59 - Jorge Lewis \nWe have input fields for the prompt We have input fields for the prompt so they They can go in here and modify the prompts in the same way. I think we can modify the prompts of the the characteristics of the the Synthetic guy. So for example, what I can do is I'll I'll kind of, actually let me take a screenshot of this. So what I want is a button here that says synthetic users. Something like this maybe. And when it opens it, let me just kind of make this empty.\n\n44:53 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so pretend like I've just, there. So here, what I think we can do is have, so I think what we'll have is two tabs. We'll have manage users.\n\n45:24 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then we'll have a new user.\n\n45:33 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the managed users, what it's going to do is help with being able to remove, or actually just, okay, I have an idea actually. So when you go to, synthetic users, the UI will look like a table with all of the properties. And then we can have a button at the top. Can I move this? A button at the top.\n\n46:14 - Jorge Lewis \nAdd new synthetic user. And when you click this, it opens a pop-up.\n\n46:25 - Jorge Lewis \nnew pop-up or a model like yeah a model model yeah what do we see and then we have we can give it a new name hmm so pretty much all of it So we get a new name, a new personality, the objective.\n\n47:02 - Jorge Lewis \nThis one can be null. So I guess all of them can be null and we can have a default.\n\n47:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n47:21 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for example, the objective, when it's default, could literally be nothing. We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here. So this is their profile information that they set, okay. So this, I guess this can be default as well. We can just set, maybe we pre-fill all of these with the default information and then so that Kuen can make a lot of new users fast. And if he wants to change it, then he can.\n\n48:07 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd maybe, this is just an idea, no clue, temperature.\n\n48:26 - Jorge Lewis \nI'm like that.\n\n48:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut yes, we have to create a new column. Yes, for every user for the temperature if you want.\n\n48:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThat will be dynamic for each create.\n\n48:49 - Jorge Lewis \nSo is it is it all good or? Yeah, yeah.\n\n48:58 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, cool. Let's go, let's go into, uh, working on that.\n\n49:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it. So which part, uh, should we start the first, uh, the UI, AI work?\n\n49:14 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, so the UI, we'll leave it to a front end. Have you worked with spells?\n\n49:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, no, actually I am proficient in react next. Yeah.\n\n49:34 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, we'll run that for now. We can worry about the backend. All of this here can be done just by creating new, we can set all this data with just doing it in Superbase. So these here, so actually this profile information is sets, this is already from, that's already in the table. This is new, and this is new.\n\n49:58 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n49:59 - Jorge Lewis \nRight. I'm sure. Correct.\n\n50:02 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo these are all new ones, but, uh, if you create the temperature, uh, uh, additional point of here, so it will affect the real user or else we have to, uh, set like, uh, if, uh, the condition, like if I did a synthetic user, then it will be, uh, getting from the database or else, uh, the default temperature of all the real user will be like that.\n\n50:27 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I think so, yeah. So, in the call, in the function that does... I think it's just called run, actually. In that function, we can take in a parameter saying synthetic or not, and then anywhere in the code we can access that variable.\n\n50:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so...\n\n50:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, I'll leave it up to you.\n\n50:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nthe basic thing here if I am just a quick recap the functionality of the backend will be pointing the listing all the you know the user the synthetic user in this dashboard it will be a function a normal select all thing and then While clicking on the new user, it will be picking the default value. I think there doesn't need to be any database. Or we can just have a normal JSON created. We can just create a JSON over here in the, and it will be storing, uh, in our local file only if we want, or maybe in the database. And this data will be, uh, you know, fetching, when the user, when the, and if that, uh, values change, it already been stored in the state like, uh, uh, the input state and if your admin takes on create, the updated value will be creating a new row in the super base.\n\n52:05 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n52:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so the flow of... Okay, so actually let's discuss quickly the flow after I click the create button when I create a new synthetic user. What should happen is that... Let me think actually.\n\n52:26 - Jorge Lewis \nSo instead of 10 because I think that's too long, because imagine this, if Kuen wants to simulate one month of the user interacting with a bot, is too 10 long, that'll be 300 minutes. So obviously if we could, we'd make it instantly. We'd make it, you click create synthetic user and it has one month or 10 months of data, of conversation data done, but the LLMs are too slow, so how do we figure out how do we figure that out based\n\n53:06 - Hasnain sayyed \non data length or based on time interval these are two options I feel but like the number of questions interval Like number of questions asked by the synthetic user, we can also point that as well. Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.\n\n53:31 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?\n\n53:42 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah, right.\n\n53:48 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This is what Q1 had said. Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up. So basically, people from the newsletter would be signing in. Should we do some kind of creating an account if a person came from the newsletter, like the workflow of it?\n\n1:16:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, described, so we're still, I feel like we're still aligned. I feel like he just misinterpreted what we do. So in FigJam, make a user flow of this user process and use these images here. So create a user flow saying, okay, and it's already there online on FigJam. If you open the depth spec, there's actually a section for the user flow, just called discovery. And in that discovery, what you should do is kind of duplicate it. Can you open FigJam?\n\n1:17:01 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see.\n\n1:17:19 - Will Vincent Parrone \nHere we go.\n\n1:17:24 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I duplicate the discovery section over here, full user auth flow. In here, search and expand upon it to create the full version with the technical thing. So saying, signs up, replacing that with more in-depth things like how they sign up.\n\n1:17:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nAnd then reply to them, yeah.\n\n1:17:49 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSounds like a plan to me then.\n\n1:17:51 - Jorge Lewis \nI think, let them know, say, um, that sounds, that sounds right. Let me make a FigDem to make, to double check.\n\n1:18:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:18:02 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll message them on Discord then. Wait, let me message Kuan now to see if I get what you're saying.\n\n1:18:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nJust to make sure that we're also perfectly aligned, I'll be creating a user on how the sign up experience would look like,\n\n1:18:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSounds like a plan.\n\n1:18:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nincluding again.\n\n1:19:00 - Unidentified Speaker \nYep.\n\n1:19:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThis looks good to me. Anything else?\n\n1:19:07 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me check the message out.\n\n1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis \nSo your message, it doesn't feel like, so I mean, he says perfect, but for me, it would be even more clear for sure thing. Like that, It just sounds like all you're saying, it sounds like he said something and then all you said was yes. But what does yes mean? Does it mean yes, that's what we have in mind or yes, I'm going to change my mind? Yes, thanks for the clarification. So when we say sure thing, what do you mean by that?\n\n1:19:44 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI just basically, I'm just basically saying that I understand. I'll keep note of what you've said. That's what I meant by sure thing.\n\n1:20:00 - Jorge Lewis \nBut we don't want to be just keeping note. We want to make sure that we can give more than that. So for example, he says, this is what we've discussed. How does that interact with what you guys are planning? It's pointless to say, I understand, just as a first thing.\n\n1:20:27 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause there's things that we need to clear up.\n\n1:20:32 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can't avoid the conflict of having cleared things up. That's what it feels like, Because there's a conflict which is, we talked about the UX being via the mentor chat with action buttons. Do you understand what he means?\n\n1:20:45 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI think right now, he is talking about the mockups.\n\n1:20:54 - Jorge Lewis \nWait.\n\n1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the answer is no. It doesn't sound like you know what he means. Neither do I. Like, I don't know exactly what he means. So it's, we can't just say yes. We're better off to saying, okay, to make sure that we're aligned. Like don't, because saying it's, um, it's like a false sense of security for him. And it's bad because if he thinks, if it creates an assumption that we understand, and then later down the road, it could bite us in the ass. This one specific example may not be the case, but for things like this, I've definitely seen it happen.

So here we give it its prompts here, but then we're also giving it more. This should be, we should try to, this is kind of as a backlog. I know this is probably temporary, but there should be a backlog for somebody to migrate it to the front end because we want everything, all the prompts to be exposed to the front end. So yeah, we need to.\n\n1:31:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nOn the backend, right?\n\n1:31:58 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, no, it's the front end. We don't want text here. We don't want this text here. What we want to do is be using the data tape, the super base and accessing the prompts from there, which admins can modify from the front end.\n\n1:32:08 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n1:32:19 - Jorge Lewis \nSo we don't want to hard code the prompts here.\n\n1:32:25 - Jorge Lewis \nBut instead, we want to use a promise for the profile. So yeah, that's something to note out. So what is this here?\n\n1:32:55 - Jorge Lewis \nUh, you can click on me somewhere.\n\n1:32:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, could you also share your screen? Uh, I can.\n\n1:33:02 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:33:03 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Okay. So, so we have this, this loop.\n\n1:33:27 - Jorge Lewis \nI just copied this thing So we don't need this here Okay, so...\n\n1:34:06 - Jorge Lewis \nWhy is that still saying? Oh, expected zero. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Sorry. Okay, this is the...\n\n1:34:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nNo, we can edit this.\n\n1:34:21 - Jorge Lewis \nThis is the new guy. I thought this was the super generate message function.\n\n1:34:29 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo this, uh, this file is different. This is a generate message function. We can just, uh, let the LLM to generate, uh, the question on the behalf of synthetic agent. So, uh, the prompt, the prompt will be different.\n\n1:34:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIs that make sense? Yeah, we just remove this all.\n\n1:35:04 - Jorge Lewis \nCorrect.\n\n1:35:21 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is not a structure of profile. I believe this is a synthetic user.\n\n1:35:36 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.\n\n1:35:39 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat was the definition of this profile though?\n\n1:35:45 - Jorge Lewis \nOver here. So we can do type, uh, then back here.\n\n1:36:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. It's not profiled. It's it's in. Yeah, there is no S. Correct. And this we have to export over here.\n\n1:36:22 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n1:36:24 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, is this correct over here? System and then, or is this a tuple?\n\n1:36:31 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then I have to do prompts.\n\n1:36:34 - Jorge Lewis \nOr how was it before? Let me just copy this.\n\n1:36:39 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, it's a list. Oh, it's just the two, okay.\n\n1:36:44 - Jorge Lewis \nSo prompts teams, okay, so this is going to change from Like it's just prompt this is not gonna be using So how How should we go about structuring the profile structure? So if you see on my screen We have the prompt is Is it these three?\n\n1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis \nOr well, we're actually. Okay. So let me think.\n\n1:37:28 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this objective is, it can be just prompt. Personality can be part of the prompt and LM. Okay. Okay. So these two are just part of the prompt. So inside of the structure of here of synthetic profile, Should I re-upload the file?\n\n1:37:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause I have deleted.\n\n1:37:53 - Hasnain sayyed \nRe-upload the file? Which file?\n\n1:37:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe CSV from the profile. So we will be having the users in the synthetic one. Like, do you want- I think, I think.\n\n1:38:05 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:06 - Jorge Lewis \nGo ahead. Yes.\n\n1:38:09 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, you know what we could do to make it more dynamic and probably better, just a lot better code is within anywhere in the original code that's accessing the profile. So let me, let me go to man to kind of illustrate what I mean. So this function here is returning a profile, right?\n\n1:38:31 - Hasnain sayyed \nRight. Just a second. Yes.\n\n1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.\n\n1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt will be false for the default value\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar.\n\n1:07:24 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:07:32 - Jorge Lewis \nIn the AI folder, there's one function that's being called somewhere, run. So inside run.\n\n1:07:43 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's one function that's been called run. This is to interact with the chatbot. We're here, we're passing it profile ID, we're passing it user message and user examples prompt. Profile ID is the only thing that's going to be different.\n\n1:08:05 - Jorge Lewis \nSo in, within synthetic user, what we need to do is somehow call this run function, right? Correct.\n\n1:08:11 - Unidentified Speaker \nCorrect.\n\n1:08:13 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, in essence, we need to call the run function.\n\n1:08:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo, and the top layer will just be the like, the edge case function that I have talked like one day, one conversation, like one day, one session, the top layer will be that the edge case condition. And we just have to create a loop over here because in this file, it's just a one case scenario, like a one way scenario. It's not a loop where it's just a HTTP request, like pointing, running this function and getting the return for one conversation. But we have to create a loop kind of thing over here.\n\n1:08:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nBased on time.\n\n1:08:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAs we discussed, 30 seconds or 1 minute.\n\n1:09:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAs I said, we have to reduce the scope right now. We want to focus on one thing right now. When you're developing software, if you're worrying about all the 30 different things that have to be made, You're never going to make one thing. Right now, we want to get a conversation happening between the bot and the user. Then we can worry about adding in time into the code. So we need to isolate small things to make.\n\n1:09:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I copy paste this thing over here?\n\n1:09:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThis function? No, no.\n\n1:09:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nI just have to change this thing. The user message will be not the parameter itself. It will be the previous. We will be getting it from the database or the few short.\n\n1:10:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhat do you mean, few short?\n\n1:10:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe database, like the prompt that a Q1 is adding from the dashboard.\n\n1:10:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe user message will be, in the real use case, will be passed by the real user, right? But in the synthetic user, it doesn't have any, like, the user message from the real user. We have to get it from database, which will be in the scenario of future.\n\n1:10:36 - Jorge Lewis \nFor the synthetic user, we should be using a language model. There should be an agent.\n\n1:10:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nOK.\n\n1:10:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo based on the- Yeah.\n\n1:10:55 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause we're trying to pretend this guy's a user. There's no reason not to use a language model. We're trying to create new data, not reuse old data.\n\n1:11:11 - Jorge Lewis \nGot it.\n\n1:11:13 - Jorge Lewis \nI was just saying- So I'm going to try to kind of start you off and see if it makes sense. So we have this run function that's being called by the dev bot. Let's go into the simple dev user.

We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.\n\n25:51 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n25:53 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, keep going. Which one? We're going to have to probably work and make, yeah.\n\n26:04 - Jorge Lewis \nYour voice is breaking. We're going to, we're going to have to work.\n\n26:09 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, it's cause I think, I think there's a bit of a delay, so we keep cutting each other, but we're going to have to work on super base probably to create some manual things.\n\n26:18 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n26:22 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right. So let's open the project. Start your screen share. Do you use this code or VS code?\n\n26:31 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, cool. Can you share a live share link?\n\n26:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, should I open that app project or? Yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\n26:46 - Hasnain sayyed \nJust a second. I just pulled the latest one.\n\n27:03 - Hasnain sayyed \nOn which branch should I pull?\n\n27:13 - Jorge Lewis \nJust a second.\n\n27:18 - Jorge Lewis \nProbably alpha. I don't know.\n\n27:21 - Hasnain sayyed \nJust a second.\n\n28:19 - Hasnain sayyed \nYes.\n\n28:25 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm now in alpha right now.\n\n28:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nDo you mind sharing your screen, by the way?\n\n28:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah, sure.\n\n28:41 - Jorge Lewis \nShow the whole screen so I can see the web server as well as the super-based things you're doing.\n\n29:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo first in the super base thing.\n\n29:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould we create the function to dynamically create this synthetic user or first we should manually interrupt the thing or what else?\n\n29:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo to start off, since that's kind of not the creating a synthetic user is part of what we can do, but I think we should start off with making a synthetic user and then go from there. But, but we have to think, yeah.\n\n30:07 - Jorge Lewis \nSo let's create one in the super base first.\n\n30:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo we have to create a new column for that, right? Because we don't have to merge the real users with the synthetic one.\n\n30:29 - Jorge Lewis \nOr what say?\n\n30:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nThat's what I was thinking as well.\n\n30:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nor just create a column here a new table or a new column right the column will identify like a real user or a synthetic user what say exactly what I was saying but my concern is that this table is\n\n30:49 - Jorge Lewis \nlinked to the chat one the id is linked to if you can see the um no it's linked to the users table that superbase uses for authentication So we can create a new profiles and you try to.\n\n31:12 - Jorge Lewis \nIf you tried to create a new row, it won't work like it because you need the ID needs to be linked to a insert the green button near the top.\n\n31:31 - Jorge Lewis \nthe green insert button above ID. I can draw on your screen, I think, right? No, let me see. I'm trying to see how I can color. Oh, you have it there.\n\n31:51 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, here we go.\n\n32:01 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm, I guess only you can.\n\n32:07 - Jorge Lewis \nBut do you see the insert button? It's green, near the top.\n\n32:17 - Jorge Lewis \nInsert button? Yeah.\n\n32:18 - Jorge Lewis \nA little bit left.\n\n32:21 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n32:22 - Jorge Lewis \nTry to insert row. And you'll see that the ID has a foreign key relation to the users table, which means that unless we create a new user in the users table using super-based authentication, we can't create a new row in this table. So that's going to prevent us from creating synthetic users like we might want to with that.\n\n32:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo like you proposed, I think we're going to have to make a new table. And even if we can later add just a column in the profile table, it takes five minutes, right? So it's better to kind of just start. So let's make a new table. Synthetic user or synthetic profile maybe to keep it the same.\n\n33:21 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I off this RLS, the rule level security because I think it's disabled. Yeah, turn it off, turn it off.\n\n33:33 - Jorge Lewis \nWe don't want to, it'll be, it'll be annoying. It just, the best practice is before you go to production, you want to turn all those on, but\n\n33:41 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm. Correct.\n\n33:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.\n\n33:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.\n\n34:05 - Hasnain\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Correct.\n\n33:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.\n\n33:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.\n\n34:05 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you copy paste over here? It will be fast. Like the name of columns, because it needs to be similar.\n\n34:18 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, um, I'm still trying to sign into the super basic account. Um, does super base have like sign in with, uh, Google?\n\n34:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, it has.\n\n34:37 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, that's exactly, but I can't see it.\n\n34:41 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, no, I mean like, it's its own platform.\n\n34:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nOh, so I don't think so.\n\n35:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOr else I can copy paste over here.\n\n35:10 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, Oh, there we go. I'm in. Nice.\n\n35:41 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm just writing the column attribute. So I just copy paste.\n\n35:51 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat I want to note on though, what I want to note on is that this synthetic user for example first name and last name hmm they don't need to be separate I think what do you think like or actually\n\n36:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nhuh actually no they do yeah I think it needs to be identical to the profile table yeah yeah um Because the functions, uh, if they're going to be using the first name, it's not using, uh, it's needs to be similar because there will be other, uh, the data is null. Okay.\n\n36:32 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, exactly. So what I've also noticed though, is that the code right now is using, um, is using the profiles table, right? So if we want to make it use the Profiles table or the synthetic user table without having to rewrite all the code Should we use like an if state like should we in the request to call the AI? That we probably need to add a parameter or something like synthetic so that we can add an add a an if operation so like if this is synthetic use the The synthetic table does that make sense?\n\n37:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah, I What I am thinking is, while the first flow, the Q1 created the synthetic user, then we have to create an external function which gets the ability for that agent, the synthetic user, to automatically chat with the agent. So we have to create that function. And the graph will be same, of course. The flow and the graph, the functions will be same. We just have to create a functionality that will automate the synthetic user to pass the message or the prompt or whatever, the query. Automatically, once it has received the agent response, then the user will automatically send That's the main rule over here. Because this is just a data. Sorry, I just clicked on Zoom. Yeah. So this is just, uh, you know, uh, the character or the character building thing. We can say, Oh, one thing we can do, we can, uh, I can just discard here. I can just come here. Uh, should I download this? Should I download this in CSV and directly, you know, or create a new table like the synthetic and import that thing? It will be much more easier.\n\n38:31 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. And then, um, and then just modify from there.\n\n38:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah. It's easy then because manually entering will take much more time.\n\n38:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. And just let's see CSV.\n\n38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. I just need to drop you.\n\n38:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. It has come here.\n\n39:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nSave.\n\n39:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, the primary key will be the ID, right? And yes, save.\n\n39:21 - Jorge Lewis \nCan I see the, the, the prop, the columns like that? You scroll down a little bit.\n\n39:33 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. We can create, uh, it's adding the column.\n\n39:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThe ID should be you, you ID.\n\n39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOK.\n\n39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nI think it's a little bit too late, but\n\n39:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt has added. OK. We can edit here.\n\n40:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think it won't change now.\n\n40:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, that's what I thought.\n\n40:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nCome on, come on, come on.\n\n40:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.

Okay.\n\n1:13:39 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, I deleted done and it doesn't work.\n\n1:13:43 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's not that, huh?\n\n1:13:45 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's not that, it's like, it's just so weird.\n\n1:13:52 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, maybe I'll do a blind research of which commit is working.\n\n1:14:00 - Jorge Lewis \nBut what it looks like, so the error also says, error when evaluating SSR module, the server file for the home page but I ain't got a clue bro all right well into your trusty hands.\n\n1:14:39 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, by the way, do we have the scope already for the Read.AI tool? A what? A scope.\n\n1:14:46 - Jorge Lewis \nScope?\n\n1:14:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, like inclusion of the to-do, like the backlogs.\n\n1:14:53 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, no, no. I mean, it's just in my head.\n\n1:14:56 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n1:14:57 - Jorge Lewis \nI use this on a daily basis for reaching out to people for sales.\n\n1:15:03 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, there's quite a few things that I would like, but they're all kind of nice to have. It's not really too important. Okay, okay.\n\n1:15:13 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll try to fix this, if ever, during my date. But it looks like Q1 wants to...\n\n1:15:21 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I think it's more important we go back to work on that. And hopefully, next time we attack this issue on rest, it's gone.\n\n1:15:29 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah. Wait, wait. Before you go, Q1 said that they're going to be signing up for the newsletter before the Y experience, so most likely, the users have an account. They're probably going to transfer the account from the newsletter to us. I'm not sure about this.\n\n1:15:49 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSorry, say that again?\n\n1:15:52 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll say this. This is what Q1 had said. Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up. So basically, people from the newsletter would be signing in. Should we do some kind of creating an account if a person came from the newsletter, like the workflow of it?\n\n1:16:25 -\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Just a second. Yes.\n\n1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.\n\n1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt will be false for the default value. You can put the default value as well.\n\n1:38:58 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, yeah. Good point. And then we do table.

That's a big, that's important.\n\n1:39:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo profiles with an S. So we wanted this one to be profiles with an S.\n\n1:39:33 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's of course best practices in terms of should we use S or not, but at least make them all the same. So if they all use S, use S.\n\n1:39:41 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. Okay.\n\n1:39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nWhich means I believe in, yeah, I already added S, okay, nice. Or did you? Okay, so it comes, what else? And I think that's, it's just that table that we're changing, right?\n\n1:39:56 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:39:59 - Jorge Lewis \nOr just do synthetic, we don't need it, we can just clean this up a bit.\n\n1:40:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nI've added the data over you.\n\n1:40:19 - Jorge Lewis \nSo pretty much like that.

So maybe, or maybe actually. We can use this code.\n\n1:43:38 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:43:41 - Jorge Lewis \nSo if I put the string, if I do this, it works.\n\n1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis \nBut I want to reuse this variable profile table since we… I think use it down? Oh no, it's just once.\n\n1:44:06 - Jorge Lewis \nWe're only asking, we're only making the simple base request once, so I guess we can use this, but I wonder maybe we should figure it out instead of\n\n1:44:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nLet me try one thing.\n\n1:45:02 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.

We have the reminders and nudges, the daily check-ins, the day-to-day mentoring, and the milestones. So these are the four main systems that are going to be used throughout the core app. So reminders and nudges, okay. Actually, this is a, follow me over.\n\n7:25 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, here, here. So this is the mentor.\n\n7:30 - Jorge Lewis \nMentor has three things to do.\n\n7:37 - Jorge Lewis \nHold up.\n\n7:46 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, I'll explain it like this. The core app has a mentor. The main agent that the user will be interacting with is the mentor. Sometimes when there's a dip in performance and the mentor gets notified by perhaps an analyst agent saying, hey, the user has been lacking on this. And then the mentor will say, okay, user, do you want to start a coaching session? And that's the coach's job. The coach's job is to go really in detail about why is the user lacking and not making progress towards their goals. What is stopping them? Do they have to update their goal? Do they have to agree on a new system, like some new practices they should do. Anyways, the mentor, his job is just facilitating everyday conversation. One of the main things that you guys were working on before was a daily check-in, right? So this is when you know about the day-to-day mentoring. All this is really is just the Everything other than the daily check-in, I think. It's kind of giving the mentor the ability to help the user and coach the user with simple things. So this will be mostly using data sources related to health, fitness, sleep, all those things so that he can provide advice. So I think this is mostly a very simple chatbot, the mentor. And then he has tools which can make him do a daily check-in.\n\n9:16 - Jorge Lewis \nAlthough this LMS feature, by the way, so initially Kuhn wanted to have an LMS, a learning management system. He wanted to, it was like kind of pretty separate to this whole app so that the, there's an LMS, the user watches a video every day and the mentor can ask the user, Hey, have you watched the video? Uh, but I don't know where Kuhn is on that right now. I think he's changed his mind a little bit since now this is becoming like a, the term he uses is a, um, is a health vault, I think, or health bank, something like that.\n\n9:50 - Jorge Lewis \nAre you familiar with the term? He just made it up, but he's been using that word a bit in the chat.\n\n10:01 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhich word?\n\n10:03 - Jorge Lewis \nHealth bank, I think.\n\n10:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nNo, I haven't heard that.\n\n10:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right.\n\n10:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut I know this LMS content like it will be recommending video based on the user past history.\n\n10:22 - Jorge Lewis \nNot recommending but just so there's there's one video every day for the user so the user picks a course I think there's gonna be multiple courses and they pick a course every day there's a new video that they have to watch. But I don't know if that's the case anymore. I don't know if Kuon has changed it or how he's been regarding that. We'll have to get updated on that.\n\n10:46 - Jorge Lewis \nThe rest of the system, reminders, milestones, these two are just very simple. What the mentor can do is remind the user.\n\n11:01 - Jorge Lewis \nthrough notifications, saying, for example, hey, your bedtime is in three hours, you shouldn't drink coffee, for example.\n\n11:12 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd the milestones are pretty much a way to motivate the user. So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over a number of days. So we present to the user saying, hey, you've reached a new milestone. You've walked 1,000 kilometers. That's like walking from France to Italy.\n\n11:56 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, one key aspect of making it very visual, the milestone. So not just, oh, you walked a thousand kilometers, like that doesn't mean anything. But instead of telling them they walked from France to Italy, that's like, oh, wow.\n\n12:07 - Unidentified Speaker \nSo.\n\n12:11 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, yeah, I hope that gives a good idea on the system, so.\n\n12:17 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what the system needs to accomplish is generate synthetic conversations so that admins can use them to improve the system through the prompts and adding reviews. The reviews is just a few-shot prompting. Are you familiar with them?\n\n12:31 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n12:31 - Jorge Lewis \nHave you seen them before?\n\n12:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n12:35 - Jorge Lewis \nSo it's just a few-shot prompting.\n\n12:39 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what we need to do, one complication is that we probably don't, well, hmm. Okay, no. So what this is going to entail is we need to create a, what do we call it? A synthetic user.\n\n13:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSo someone needs the ability.\n\n13:11 - Jorge Lewis \nAdmin needs the capability to create new synthetic users.\n\n13:25 - Jorge Lewis \nI got an idea what you are trying to say.\n\n13:26 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo synthetic user is basically a topic based thing, for example, based on different scenarios, the synthetic agent, you know, we can embed the few short and the prompts dynamically to that topic only. And the admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic agents. Is that what you are trying to point?\n\n14:08 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so I don't think so.\n\n14:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nI mean, you know, the URL for the project Like I just want to know what capabilities the synthetic user will have. Just simple.\n\n14:27 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So the synthetic user is all the synthetic users job or the synthetic user is really just the fake user, right? Does that make sense?\n\n14:37 - Jorge Lewis \nOh yeah. Makes sense.\n\n14:39 - Jorge Lewis \nBut so his old, his end goal for the synthetic user is to pretend to be a user and generates a, a synthetic conversation. So synthetic data. Okay. But there's some things, so for example, I want to, let me share my screen actually.\n\n15:09 - Jorge Lewis \nCan you see?\n\n15:10 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I can see.\n\n15:11 - Jorge Lewis \nDo you know the URL to the app?\n\n15:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nYes.\n\n15:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo let's send you.\n\n15:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nOh, yes, please.\n\n15:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nSend in the chat.\n\n15:43 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So, so here, wow, that's a lot of users. Um, so here is, is this is like kind of a, just a temporary kind of page for selecting a user where after we use user authentication, will be gone. But what I was thinking is, since these are all users, or actually, no this should probably be in the admin panel. So you see how I have to select profile when I want to modify the prompts.\n\n16:22 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what I'm thinking we do is somewhere on the sidebar, we can have a page called simulation. And in that simulation, we have a button. We can configure the synthetic user. So a synthetic user can have the properties of this. So we can tell it its main objective to test, and then What else? We can just give it some background, like personality. Or give it a user profile. Or goal, maybe.\n\n17:20 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so this is the goal, the main objective. So this can also be, This can be generic.\n\n17:36 - Jorge Lewis \nSo just no goal.\n\n17:41 - Jorge Lewis \nA synthetic user needs the prompt, it needs to understand, or we need to tell it who it is. So it's a user, or you are chatting with a life coach bot, you know, and tell it the thing. So we need to give it, tell it who it is and what.\n\n18:13 - Jorge Lewis \nYou are the person So, uh, hardships might be.\n\n18:32 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, so what we also need to do, which is quite important, is simulating multiple days because the chapel actually uses time.\n\n18:47 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need to make sure that... Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain\n######################\nOutput:"}}

I mean, I'll compile it.\n\n1:15:09 - Jorge Lewis \nProfile for, okay, so. Okay, so let's make a new file that generates a message. Message, yes. And then here we can just do prompt run.\n\n1:15:50 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, so I've made just a simple run function and, or let me actually just.\n\n1:16:00 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then, okay.\n\n1:16:17 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, I'm messing up with your if code.\n\n1:16:26 - Unidentified Speaker \nWhy?\n\n1:16:27 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, are you error tracking or?\n\n1:16:42 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I add this data types like synthetic user in the database.types? So this error will be gone.\n\n1:16:56 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me, I'm not seeing your screen. Over here. Yes. I don't have some of the highlighting because I'm on your live share.\n\n1:17:10 - Jorge Lewis \nGenerate the new types.\n\n1:17:13 - Jorge Lewis \nYes.\n\n1:17:15 - Jorge Lewis \nThat's a good idea.\n\n1:17:28 - Jorge Lewis \nIf there's only one super base call in the script or in the code, you don't want to name them.

Because it was quite helpful.\n\n1:21:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so we're going to, what's the statement? So we have a message.\n\n1:22:11 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, imagine the message history is no messages, so we're going to have the synthetic user generate a message first, and then the AdaptBot will reply to it. We need to wrap all this in a for loop.\n\n1:22:32 - Jorge Lewis \nWhich one? This?\n\n1:22:35 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the synthetic user and the response to that need to be looped if we want to kind of have a conversation. So let's say we want to have a conversation of 10 messages.\n\n1:22:46 - Hasnain sayyed \nWe can just do a for loop for So based on the user response, maybe like Sorry, based on the user question, we can point like, yeah, it's 10. Or maybe a normal pointer while const let a is equal to 10.\n\n1:23:21 - Jorge Lewis \n2 Use a for loop, no?\n\n1:23:29 - Hasnain sayyed \nMaybe, yes.\n\n1:23:33 - Jorge Lewis \nI can't remember the syntax, though, so I'm going to search it up.\n\n1:23:39 - Jorge Lewis \nFor loop syntax, OK.\n\n1:23:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt's equal to 0, then 10.\n\n1:23:56 - Hasnain sayyed \nA plus plus.\n\n1:23:57 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:23:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nThis is the basic syntax and it will be running 10 times.\n\n1:24:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe messages will be passing through this and RES we have to store this thing because the run function is performing actions on this as well.\n\n1:24:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, we have events.\n\n1:24:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe one thing over here is, if you look my screen, yeah, so in the post chat, the events, it is storing the chat in events.

So that's one, one minute for us.\n\n59:25 - Jorge Lewis \nwe multiply it by a multiplier, not divide it. So 20 seconds for us, we multiply it by 100, that's 2,000 for them.\n\n59:44 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, all right, let's get into it. So you can open VS Code, share a live share link. So it's 1.30, we've already done an hour. Let's do 30 more minutes if you don't mind. Just so we can get some coding in.\n\n59:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, sure.\n\n1:00:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, I have sent in the chat.\n\n1:00:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you access it?\n\n1:00:57 - Jorge Lewis \nTrying now.\n\n1:01:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I create a column here that the last time maybe, because that's the starting point to write the function, the last time compared by the current time.\n\n1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, could you say that again? I was working on the VS code thing.\n\n1:01:37 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so I was telling like, we have to like, as I said, before, we have to add a time variable in the synthetic table, like the last run.\n\n1:01:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, last executed. Oh, yeah. So We can compare the last executed with the current time. And if that is not more than 24 hours, then that synthetic user won't execute. And if it is more than two hours or maybe equal to, then we can execute.\n\n1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, but what I would suggest is we ignore the time controlling first because that will expand the scope a lot and there's so many different edge cases to manage that it'll kind of not allow us to focus on getting something first. So we have this task, we have to make a simulation system. We need this system, we want to, we want to get something done, something that we can see the smallest thing that we can see is going to be one conversation back and forth. We don't need to worry about time. It's just a user having the synthetic user having a conversation with the ball. You can have a stop button so that they don't forever go on.\n\n1:03:03 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then later you can already be excited to see that you can have conversations. And, um, yeah.\n\n1:03:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n1:03:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo first thing, what should we start like with the super base creating functions or what else? What do you suggest?\n\n1:03:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I'll leave it up to you. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it up to you. You, you can think, okay, we've got a couple of things to do. I'm just picking one. Usually it works pretty well. Just starting. It's hard to find the right answer because they're all OK.\n\n1:03:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause the main thing that is coming to my mind is that function to create.\n\n1:04:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm thinking how to execute that.\n\n1:04:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so one thing we can do is and getting this for this. You we have to create a rag over here like the sorry the graph sorry the graph will be similar to this everything will be similar to this folder but that will make the easy and the starting point will be\n\n1:06:14 - Hasnain sayyed \ngraph Okay.\n\n1:06:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nEverything I think will be similar, uh, to this folder itself. Uh, just, uh, this folder is calling the real user. It will, in this folder, we will be calling the synthetic user. And additionally, uh, the top layer will be the edge case that we have talked like the time variable.\n\n1:06:35 - Jorge Lewis \nRight.\n\n1:06:37 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, we, I don't think so. Are you, are you suggesting we just copy and paste the AI folder?\n\n1:06:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, yes. Or I don't like, are you saying that the not copy pasting, like, uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So we're synthetic here on the right-hand side of the equals is just is saying making it a string. But then we're just typing it as a tables synthetic profile. But for me, it's not giving any errors.

So that's one, one minute for us.\n\n59:25 - Jorge Lewis \nwe multiply it by a multiplier, not divide it. So 20 seconds for us, we multiply it by 100, that's 2,000 for them.\n\n59:44 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, all right, let's get into it. So you can open VS Code, share a live share link. So it's 1.30, we've already done an hour. Let's do 30 more minutes if you don't mind. Just so we can get some coding in.\n\n59:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, sure.\n\n1:00:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, I have sent in the chat.\n\n1:00:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you access it?\n\n1:00:57 - Jorge Lewis \nTrying now.\n\n1:01:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I create a column here that the last time maybe, because that's the starting point to write the function, the last time compared by the current time.\n\n1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, could you say that again? I was working on the VS code thing.\n\n1:01:37 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so I was telling like, we have to like, as I said, before, we have to add a time variable in the synthetic table, like the last run.\n\n1:01:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, last executed. Oh, yeah. So We can compare the last executed with the current time. And if that is not more than 24 hours, then that synthetic user won't execute. And if it is more than two hours or maybe equal to, then we can execute.\n\n1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, but what I would suggest is we ignore the time controlling first because that will expand the scope a lot and there's so many different edge cases to manage that it'll kind of not allow us to focus on getting something first. So we have this task, we have to make a simulation system. We need this system, we want to, we want to get something done, something that we can see the smallest thing that we can see is going to be one conversation back and forth. We don't need to worry about time. It's just a user having the synthetic user having a conversation with the ball. You can have a stop button so that they don't forever go on.\n\n1:03:03 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then later you can already be excited to see that you can have conversations. And, um, yeah.\n\n1:03:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n1:03:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo first thing, what should we start like with the super base creating functions or what else? What do you suggest?\n\n1:03:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I'll leave it up to you. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it up to you. You, you can think, okay, we've got a couple of things to do. I'm just picking one. Usually it works pretty well. Just starting. It's hard to find the right answer because they're all OK.\n\n1:03:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause the main thing that is coming to my mind is that function to create.\n\n1:04:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm thinking how to execute that.\n\n1:04:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so one thing we can do is and getting this for this. You we have to create a rag over here like the sorry the graph sorry the graph will be similar to this everything will be similar to this folder but that will make the easy and the starting point will be\n\n1:06:14 - Hasnain sayyed \ngraph Okay.\n\n1:06:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nEverything I think will be similar, uh, to this folder itself. Uh, just, uh, this folder is calling the real user. It will, in this folder, we will be calling the synthetic user. And additionally, uh, the top layer will be the edge case that we have talked like the time variable.\n\n1:06:35 - Jorge Lewis \nRight.\n\n1:06:37 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, we, I don't think so. Are you, are you suggesting we just copy and paste the AI folder?\n\n1:06:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, yes. Or I don't like, are you saying that the not copy pasting, like, uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar\n######################\nOutput:"}}

What about you?\n\n0:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, all good.\n\n0:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nHave you looked at the Figma file that I have created for brain project?\n\n0:18 - Jorge Lewis \nI did, I did, I did. I made some, so I went down a rabbit hole yesterday of just learning some stuff. Can you give me an idea of what's the flow for this ADAPT simulation, what kind of thing we have to work with?\n\n0:50 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, exactly. So, so that's what we'll get into. So we'll kind of today in this, in this hour, I think probably we'll do an hour and a half. We'll kind of figure out what do we, what are the requirements? What do we require the system to accomplish? Um, and then we'll go into kind of making it.\n\n1:03 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So are we creating in Figma or in like the code stuff?\n\n1:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo we'll start with Figma and then we'll go into the code. Okay. It's only a span, maybe 10 minutes in the, in the Figma.\n\n1:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay.\n\n1:17 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can take a quick look at your graph from yesterday. These are all of my thoughts from yesterday. I was just doing a lot of learning.\n\n1:38 - Jorge Lewis \nSo there's gonna be a big issue, which I put a message yesterday, but people didn't understand is that we're doing so much data. So every day, if you look at, I did some math here, every day it's 85,600 words. So that's not too much in terms of like, that's around 430 kilobytes, that's fine. But when you, put that into a vector database, it's about one gigabyte, that many words. And when you put in a knowledge graph, then it scales much, it's much harder to scale. So there's gonna be a big, there's gonna be that issue, it's gonna be too big. Like of course we can use really powerful servers and stuff, but it just can't scale. This is one gigabyte a day over, like for a knowledge graph, since it's more, it's harder, or it's a bigger, data structure, it's going to be much bigger. So like over 10 days, when you connect multiple nodes, like it's just, uh, I think it'll get out of hand. So we need to figure out that.\n\n2:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Data is the main concern, like how we keep updated and you know, uh, how can we manage that as well? Because the data is changing each and every day. So we have to, yeah.\n\n2:57 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So, so I put a, I put a note here, an idea to have a longterm and a short term system where We have our long-term system that gets updated maybe once a day or once every so often. And then we have a short-term system which is very basic, like just simple rag maybe. The long-term can be a knowledge graph and the new one can be a vector database.\n\n3:20 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, yeah, so I did take a look at yours. Although some of the, I really like this pros and cons list, by the way. I didn't see this until after this morning. I was looking at the graph and then I saw that.\n\n3:34 - Jorge Lewis \nBut for the graph, I didn't totally understand all of the items.\n\n3:38 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah. So let me get you. Will I explain like what's my idea behind?\n\n3:46 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can we can try to do that another time since I would like to do the the adapt evaluation system So after the adapt thing if I still have time then we can do that.\n\n3:54 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay?\n\n3:54 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, cool. Yeah, so let's let's get into so I'll go to Adapt project and I'll make a new design file a new fig gem board Or actually I'll go to the go to the adapt spec page the main one and then make a new page and All right, so I'll make a new page. All right, can you see the new page?\n\n4:40 - Jorge Lewis \nYes, I can.\n\n4:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, simulation, I can see.\n\n4:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what does this need to accomplish? Let's see. So we need it to generate synthetic conversations so that admins can How up to date are you on your DAD projects?\n\n5:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nLike I know the graph working like the check-in the chatting and Onboarding, yeah, the last onboarding I know a little bit.\n\n5:46 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n5:49 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, pretty much same. Okay, so pretty much, do you understand the vision of ADAPT, the goal?\n\n5:58 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, so it's kind of 10 weeks framework. It will ask the goal of the user, like whether he wants\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So we have to club this ID to the events itself. Because the profile ID is also pointing to events.\n\n1:25:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhat do you mean?\n\n1:25:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nLike the history, the chat history is being stored in this event table. Yep. So this profile ID has a foreign key in this events.\n\n1:25:27 - Hasnain sayyed \nDoes it?\n\n1:25:28 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.\n\n1:25:38 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhere is that?\n\n1:25:41 - Hasnain sayyed \nOk, so it's externally storing. I failed. I thought.\n\n1:25:52 - Jorge Lewis \nOK. So it is linked, though. It is linked. Go back to Superbase. There's a green icon next to it. That means it's linked. That means there's a foreign key.\n\n1:26:01 - Jorge Lewis \nSo no, on profile ID, that green icon, that means it's linked. No, no, no. Back where you were. Do you see the icon? Yeah, yeah. It's a foreign key with profile. So let's open up that detail of the column so that we can modify it. Because if it's foreign link to profile table, that means we can't add events from our synthetic user, which we want to. So let's see if we can add a foreign link.\n\n1:26:28 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, there we go.\n\n1:26:29 - Unidentified Speaker \nNice.\n\n1:26:31 - Hasnain sayyed \nSelect table profile.\n\n1:26:38 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, yes.

So what we have to do is either delete all the items. Is that OK? Can we do that?\n\n1:28:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nYes, or else we can't edit this thing. Can't edit the value.\n\n1:28:40 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, so the only thing is if Kuhn is testing it, but I don't think he is. So let's just delete everything.\n\n1:28:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nAnd if he says, why did you delete everything that we say in the synthetic profile, uh, we can delete and we can check, uh, if it's added because I feel, uh, the ID is similar, uh, but that doesn't the case.\n\n1:29:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nlet me delete this and try in the synthetic.\n\n1:29:14 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, the problem was because every row in the, or every row in the events table was linked, was a foreign key link to the profile ID. The structure of the cell was a foreign key link to profile ID. It was not foreign key. I wasn't a foreign key link to profile ID or, um, Uh, forward key to the profile ID or the synthetic profile ID. So now it is because I deleted all the events.\n\n1:29:44 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:29:44 - Jorge Lewis \nSo now we shouldn't have an issue with it.\n\n1:30:33 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so we can copy this supervisor agent code over here, because whoa, in this file, what say there's there's Sorry, I was just looking at the code.\n\n1:31:02 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's a lot of, there's a prompt.

So, so I saw that under supervisor, there is a lot of, there is, um, his system. What is this? Yeah. So, so if you follow me, Hmm. So here we give it its prompts here, but then we're also giving it more. This should be, we should try to, this is kind of as a backlog.

Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.\n\n53:31 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?\n\n53:42 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah, right.\n\n53:48 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I think will be kind of annoying is, so the synthetic user, how will he or when will he send a message? Because how that will work is, this guy sends a message to this guy, this guy responds immediately, the bot responds immediately. And then the synthetic user, because he's in LLM, will receive the response and respond immediately as well. And it'll keep going. There's no way to say, okay, um, yeah, no, not even waiting for it. Like for example, a normal user, they wake up, they'll open the app, they'll talk, chat with the user, the chatbot and say, Hey, um, hi. They'll have a conversation. The phone, the usual, put the phone down. But in our case, the synthetic user, how do we tell him to put the phone down?\n\n54:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n54:53 - Hasnain sayyed \nOne, one, one idea.\n\n54:59 - Jorge Lewis \nOne idea is that we separate, um, we give the, the synthetic user, their concept of a, um, of, of a conversation and the synthetic user will know, or we'll have an objective for each conversation. And when it reaches that objective, it closes the conversation and then it, um, it calls a function saying let's time elapse and it lets an hour or two pass fake, fake one hour or two.\n\n55:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, okay. I got it. Um, but I'm thinking like how we create that function, like, uh, while conversation between two points, we have to create a loop kind of thing that this is the basic, uh, brute force approach or else we have to based on we have to create a function like based on the like response from the synthetic user it will it will think like if the synthetic user wants to ask another question like wants to give another answer or not or like it will stop at that point this is the two solutions I can think like the\n\n56:17 - Jorge Lewis \nIs the loop, so I have an idea, but it might be the same as a loop. It's like a brute force, like you said. A conversation is five minutes. So that after five minutes, they stop talking and we let time to pass. Is that what you're suggesting?\n\n56:34 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, correct, correct.\n\n56:36 - Jorge Lewis \nI think we can do that, yeah.\n\n56:40 - Jorge Lewis \nBut like right now, we don't have to worry about that. We can just make it have, We can just let it go back and forth. We don't have to worry. And then later we can worry about controlling the time. How does that sound?\n\n56:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nCorrect. We can change the time, whatever we want. It's just one variable we have to change.\n\n57:02 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, OK, cool.\n\n57:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, there are normal edge cases in the background, like the synthetic user has to chat one day at a time, like only one day, five minutes or two minutes, whatever we set. It won't have to reiterate. Yeah, that's the normal edge case.\n\n57:21 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can add all these edge cases, I think, one by one if we need to, right?\n\n57:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. We have, we have to add a column here. We have to add, uh, like, uh, uh, maybe the last time, uh, he chatted and, uh, based on the last time, uh, it will add 24 hours, whether, uh, it is, uh, like, uh, greater, like it will compare the current time and the last time. And whether there is a gap of 24 hours or not, if there is not a 24 hours gap, then it won't execute that function or if there is a gap.\n\n58:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOne point I have, the one most important question is, it is not a WebSocket, right? It is a HTTP request. Like, how can, how could we let the synthetic user run by itself? Like, okay, the condition satisfies, like, yeah. There is a gap between 24 hours maybe. Then how the synthetic agent will let know like, yeah, there is a 24 hours gap. Like the API hit.\n\n58:39 - Jorge Lewis \nThat's a good point. I think we'll have to use some sort of either edge servers or edge functions or, um, yeah, I think something related to edge functions.\n\n58:57 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay.\n\n59:00 - Jorge Lewis \nBut we, yeah, so we'll worry about time later since that can be added on top of, um, and by the way, just a quick concept of how we can control all the time is in data in super base, we can store the time, um, like normal, like, uh, as normal, but in the, in the system, the code, we divide\n######################\nOutput:"}}

What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.\n\n1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt will be false for the default value. You can put the default value as well.\n\n1:38:58 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, yeah. Good point. And then we do table.

That's a big, that's important.\n\n1:39:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo profiles with an S. So we wanted this one to be profiles with an S.\n\n1:39:33 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's of course best practices in terms of should we use S or not, but at least make them all the same. So if they all use S, use S.\n\n1:39:41 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. Okay.\n\n1:39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nWhich means I believe in, yeah, I already added S, okay, nice. Or did you? Okay, so it comes, what else? And I think that's, it's just that table that we're changing, right?\n\n1:39:56 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:39:59 - Jorge Lewis \nOr just do synthetic, we don't need it, we can just clean this up a bit.\n\n1:40:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nI've added the data over you.\n\n1:40:19 - Jorge Lewis \nSo pretty much like that. And then we use, Oh, is that you?\n\n1:40:30 - Jorge Lewis \nNo.\n\n1:40:33 - Jorge Lewis \nHuh?\n\n1:40:35 - Jorge Lewis \nUh, So, what type, what does this take in?\n\n1:40:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think the row, maybe?\n\n1:41:02 - Jorge Lewis \nActually, I think I know.\n\n1:41:11 - Jorge Lewis \nIf you go into database.types, it takes in...\n\n1:41:18 - Jorge Lewis \nTake some of these things.\n\n1:41:22 - Unidentified Speaker \nTables.\n\n1:41:29 - Jorge Lewis \nHow do I?

So maybe, or maybe actually. We can use this code.\n\n1:43:38 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:43:41 - Jorge Lewis \nSo if I put the string, if I do this, it works.\n\n1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis \nBut I want to reuse this variable profile table since we… I think use it down?

Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.\n\n39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's actually a good compromise.\n\n39:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause in today's world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it's a good kind of reminder.

It was just funny because it's like two characters doesn't make you more efficient, but it's just so funny. I don't know. It's like the inside the head of a developer.

Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up.

We need to tell the agent.\n\n41:35 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need to tell the agent, the synthetic profile, who it is or what its objective is. Because like me as a user, I know what I'm doing. So I think we can add a column for prompts. So if you go to the, if you scroll left a little bit.\n\n41:58 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, yeah, left, left. Yeah, no, the other way, the other way.\n\n42:04 - Jorge Lewis \nMore, more. There's a prompts column that I'm looking for.\n\n42:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, it's there.\n\n42:10 - Jorge Lewis \nSo here, so this column in a real profile is connected to the admin page. But since this synthetic user is not accessing the admin page, I think we can change it. I think we can change the structure of it.\n\n42:28 - Jorge Lewis \nI wonder if Yeah, I think that should be fine. Let's do that. So in the structure of the...\n\n42:42 - Jorge Lewis \nI'll also share my screen, by the way.\n\n42:44 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, please, please.\n\n42:48 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd that way we can just go back and forth.\n\n42:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah. What I'm thinking is...\n\n42:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould we add an option to the admin panel, like, or get a, like, if the flow that we have decided will add a similar kind of user, because we haven't created any option to, you know, change the user character or the few short prompt, whatever. So we can have some options to admin that, like four or five examples, we have to, create that data. And whenever the user clicks on, whenever the admin clicks, like, yeah, I need this character, I need this synthetic user character, maybe like a goal will be different for that synthetic user. Have you got the point?\n\n43:43 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so you see my screen share.\n\n43:59 - Jorge Lewis \nWe have input fields for the prompt We have input fields for the prompt so they They can go in here and modify the prompts in the same way. I think we can modify the prompts of the the characteristics of the the Synthetic guy. So for example, what I can do is I'll I'll kind of, actually let me take a screenshot of this. So what I want is a button here that says synthetic users. Something like this maybe. And when it opens it, let me just kind of make this empty.\n\n44:53 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so pretend like I've just, there. So here, what I think we can do is have, so I think what we'll have is two tabs. We'll have manage users.\n\n45:24 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then we'll have a new user.\n\n45:33 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the managed users, what it's going to do is help with being able to remove, or actually just, okay, I have an idea actually. So when you go to, synthetic users, the UI will look like a table with all of the properties. And then we can have a button at the top. Can I move this? A button at the top.\n\n46:14 - Jorge Lewis \nAdd new synthetic user. And when you click this, it opens a pop-up.\n\n46:25 - Jorge Lewis \nnew pop-up or a model like yeah a model model yeah what do we see and then we have we can give it a new name hmm so pretty much all of it So we get a new name, a new personality, the objective.\n\n47:02 - Jorge Lewis \nThis one can be null. So I guess all of them can be null and we can have a default.\n\n47:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n47:21 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for example, the objective, when it's default, could literally be nothing. We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This is what Q1 had said. Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up. So basically, people from the newsletter would be signing in. Should we do some kind of creating an account if a person came from the newsletter, like the workflow of it?\n\n1:16:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, described, so we're still, I feel like we're still aligned. I feel like he just misinterpreted what we do. So in FigJam, make a user flow of this user process and use these images here. So create a user flow saying, okay, and it's already there online on FigJam. If you open the depth spec, there's actually a section for the user flow, just called discovery. And in that discovery, what you should do is kind of duplicate it. Can you open FigJam?\n\n1:17:01 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see.\n\n1:17:19 - Will Vincent Parrone \nHere we go.\n\n1:17:24 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I duplicate the discovery section over here, full user auth flow. In here, search and expand upon it to create the full version with the technical thing. So saying, signs up, replacing that with more in-depth things like how they sign up.\n\n1:17:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nAnd then reply to them, yeah.\n\n1:17:49 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSounds like a plan to me then.\n\n1:17:51 - Jorge Lewis \nI think, let them know, say, um, that sounds, that sounds right. Let me make a FigDem to make, to double check.\n\n1:18:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:18:02 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll message them on Discord then. Wait, let me message Kuan now to see if I get what you're saying.\n\n1:18:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nJust to make sure that we're also perfectly aligned, I'll be creating a user on how the sign up experience would look like,\n\n1:18:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSounds like a plan.\n\n1:18:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nincluding again.\n\n1:19:00 - Unidentified Speaker \nYep.\n\n1:19:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThis looks good to me. Anything else?\n\n1:19:07 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me check the message out.\n\n1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis \nSo your message, it doesn't feel like, so I mean, he says perfect, but for me, it would be even more clear for sure thing. Like that, It just sounds like all you're saying, it sounds like he said something and then all you said was yes. But what does yes mean? Does it mean yes, that's what we have in mind or yes, I'm going to change my mind? Yes, thanks for the clarification. So when we say sure thing, what do you mean by that?\n\n1:19:44 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI just basically, I'm just basically saying that I understand. I'll keep note of what you've said. That's what I meant by sure thing.\n\n1:20:00 - Jorge Lewis \nBut we don't want to be just keeping note. We want to make sure that we can give more than that. So for example, he says, this is what we've discussed. How does that interact with what you guys are planning? It's pointless to say, I understand, just as a first thing.\n\n1:20:27 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause there's things that we need to clear up.\n\n1:20:32 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can't avoid the conflict of having cleared things up. That's what it feels like, Because there's a conflict which is, we talked about the UX being via the mentor chat with action buttons. Do you understand what he means?\n\n1:20:45 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI think right now, he is talking about the mockups.\n\n1:20:54 - Jorge Lewis \nWait.\n\n1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the answer is no. It doesn't sound like you know what he means. Neither do I. Like, I don't know exactly what he means. So it's, we can't just say yes. We're better off to saying, okay, to make sure that we're aligned. Like don't, because saying it's, um, it's like a false sense of security for him. And it's bad because if he thinks, if it creates an assumption that we understand, and then later down the road, it could bite us in the ass. This one specific example may not be the case, but for things like this, I've definitely seen it happen. I wouldn't be stressing it as much if I didn't see this happen before.\n\n1:21:38 - Jorge Lewis \nIf you feel what I'm saying.\n\n1:21:40 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, okay. I hear what you're saying.\n\n1:21:48 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSo, what are the improvements that you think I should do, like, It's not on how I voice my messages. I think it's being a bit more inquisitive. Questioning, I suppose.\n\n1:22:02 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, of course, it depends on your style then.\n\n1:22:14 - Will Vincent Parrone \nMm-hmm.\n\n1:22:21 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSorry.\n\n1:\n######################\nOutput:"}}

What about you?\n\n0:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, all good.\n\n0:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nHave you looked at the Figma file that I have created for brain project?\n\n0:18 - Jorge Lewis \nI did, I did, I did. I made some, so I went down a rabbit hole yesterday of just learning some stuff. Can you give me an idea of what's the flow for this ADAPT simulation, what kind of thing we have to work with?\n\n0:50 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, exactly. So, so that's what we'll get into. So we'll kind of today in this, in this hour, I think probably we'll do an hour and a half. We'll kind of figure out what do we, what are the requirements? What do we require the system to accomplish? Um, and then we'll go into kind of making it.\n\n1:03 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So are we creating in Figma or in like the code stuff?\n\n1:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo we'll start with Figma and then we'll go into the code. Okay. It's only a span, maybe 10 minutes in the, in the Figma.\n\n1:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay.\n\n1:17 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can take a quick look at your graph from yesterday. These are all of my thoughts from yesterday. I was just doing a lot of learning.\n\n1:38 - Jorge Lewis \nSo there's gonna be a big issue, which I put a message yesterday, but people didn't understand is that we're doing so much data. So every day, if you look at, I did some math here, every day it's 85,600 words. So that's not too much in terms of like, that's around 430 kilobytes, that's fine. But when you, put that into a vector database, it's about one gigabyte, that many words. And when you put in a knowledge graph, then it scales much, it's much harder to scale. So there's gonna be a big, there's gonna be that issue, it's gonna be too big. Like of course we can use really powerful servers and stuff, but it just can't scale. This is one gigabyte a day over, like for a knowledge graph, since it's more, it's harder, or it's a bigger, data structure, it's going to be much bigger. So like over 10 days, when you connect multiple nodes, like it's just, uh, I think it'll get out of hand. So we need to figure out that.\n\n2:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Data is the main concern, like how we keep updated and you know, uh, how can we manage that as well? Because the data is changing each and every day. So we have to, yeah.\n\n2:57 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So, so I put a, I put a note here, an idea to have a longterm and a short term system where We have our long-term system that gets updated maybe once a day or once every so often. And then we have a short-term system which is very basic, like just simple rag maybe. The long-term can be a knowledge graph and the new one can be a vector database.\n\n3:20 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, yeah, so I did take a look at yours. Although some of the, I really like this pros and cons list, by the way. I didn't see this until after this morning. I was looking at the graph and then I saw that.\n\n3:34 - Jorge Lewis \nBut for the graph, I didn't totally understand all of the items.\n\n3:38 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah. So let me get you. Will I explain like what's my idea behind?\n\n3:46 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can we can try to do that another time since I would like to do the the adapt evaluation system So after the adapt thing if I still have time then we can do that.\n\n3:54 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay?\n\n3:54 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, cool. Yeah, so let's let's get into so I'll go to Adapt project and I'll make a new design file a new fig gem board Or actually I'll go to the go to the adapt spec page the main one and then make a new page and All right, so I'll make a new page. All right, can you see the new page?\n\n4:40 - Jorge Lewis \nYes, I can.\n\n4:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, simulation, I can see.\n\n4:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what does this need to accomplish? Let's see. So we need it to generate synthetic conversations so that admins can How up to date are you on your DAD projects?\n\n5:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nLike I know the graph working like the check-in the chatting and Onboarding, yeah, the last onboarding I know a little bit.\n\n5:46 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n5:49 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, pretty much same. Okay, so pretty much, do you understand the vision of ADAPT, the goal?\n\n5:58 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, so it's kind of 10 weeks framework. It will ask the goal of the user, like whether he wants\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here. So this is their profile information that they set, okay. So this, I guess this can be default as well. We can just set, maybe we pre-fill all of these with the default information and then so that Kuen can make a lot of new users fast. And if he wants to change it, then he can.\n\n48:07 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd maybe, this is just an idea, no clue, temperature.\n\n48:26 - Jorge Lewis \nI'm like that.\n\n48:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut yes, we have to create a new column. Yes, for every user for the temperature if you want.\n\n48:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThat will be dynamic for each create.\n\n48:49 - Jorge Lewis \nSo is it is it all good or? Yeah, yeah.\n\n48:58 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, cool. Let's go, let's go into, uh, working on that.\n\n49:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it. So which part, uh, should we start the first, uh, the UI, AI work?\n\n49:14 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, so the UI, we'll leave it to a front end. Have you worked with spells?\n\n49:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, no, actually I am proficient in react next. Yeah.\n\n49:34 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, we'll run that for now. We can worry about the backend. All of this here can be done just by creating new, we can set all this data with just doing it in Superbase. So these here, so actually this profile information is sets, this is already from, that's already in the table. This is new, and this is new.\n\n49:58 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n49:59 - Jorge Lewis \nRight. I'm sure. Correct.\n\n50:02 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo these are all new ones, but, uh, if you create the temperature, uh, uh, additional point of here, so it will affect the real user or else we have to, uh, set like, uh, if, uh, the condition, like if I did a synthetic user, then it will be, uh, getting from the database or else, uh, the default temperature of all the real user will be like that.\n\n50:27 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I think so, yeah. So, in the call, in the function that does... I think it's just called run, actually. In that function, we can take in a parameter saying synthetic or not, and then anywhere in the code we can access that variable.\n\n50:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so...\n\n50:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, I'll leave it up to you.\n\n50:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nthe basic thing here if I am just a quick recap the functionality of the backend will be pointing the listing all the you know the user the synthetic user in this dashboard it will be a function a normal select all thing and then While clicking on the new user, it will be picking the default value. I think there doesn't need to be any database. Or we can just have a normal JSON created. We can just create a JSON over here in the, and it will be storing, uh, in our local file only if we want, or maybe in the database. And this data will be, uh, you know, fetching, when the user, when the, and if that, uh, values change, it already been stored in the state like, uh, uh, the input state and if your admin takes on create, the updated value will be creating a new row in the super base.\n\n52:05 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n52:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so the flow of... Okay, so actually let's discuss quickly the flow after I click the create button when I create a new synthetic user. What should happen is that... Let me think actually.\n\n52:26 - Jorge Lewis \nSo instead of 10 because I think that's too long, because imagine this, if Kuen wants to simulate one month of the user interacting with a bot, is too 10 long, that'll be 300 minutes. So obviously if we could, we'd make it instantly. We'd make it, you click create synthetic user and it has one month or 10 months of data, of conversation data done, but the LLMs are too slow, so how do we figure out how do we figure that out based\n\n53:06 - Hasnain sayyed \non data length or based on time interval these are two options I feel but like the number of questions interval Like number of questions asked by the synthetic user, we can also point that as well. Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.\n\n53:31 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?\n\n53:42 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah, right.\n\n53:48 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Correct.\n\n33:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.\n\n33:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.\n\n34:05 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you copy paste over here? It will be fast. Like the name of columns, because it needs to be similar.\n\n34:18 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, um, I'm still trying to sign into the super basic account. Um, does super base have like sign in with, uh, Google?\n\n34:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, it has.\n\n34:37 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, that's exactly, but I can't see it.\n\n34:41 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, no, I mean like, it's its own platform.\n\n34:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nOh, so I don't think so.\n\n35:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOr else I can copy paste over here.\n\n35:10 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, Oh, there we go. I'm in. Nice.\n\n35:41 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm just writing the column attribute. So I just copy paste.\n\n35:51 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat I want to note on though, what I want to note on is that this synthetic user for example first name and last name hmm they don't need to be separate I think what do you think like or actually\n\n36:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nhuh actually no they do yeah I think it needs to be identical to the profile table yeah yeah um Because the functions, uh, if they're going to be using the first name, it's not using, uh, it's needs to be similar because there will be other, uh, the data is null. Okay.\n\n36:32 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, exactly. So what I've also noticed though, is that the code right now is using, um, is using the profiles table, right? So if we want to make it use the Profiles table or the synthetic user table without having to rewrite all the code Should we use like an if state like should we in the request to call the AI? That we probably need to add a parameter or something like synthetic so that we can add an add a an if operation so like if this is synthetic use the The synthetic table does that make sense?\n\n37:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah, I What I am thinking is, while the first flow, the Q1 created the synthetic user, then we have to create an external function which gets the ability for that agent, the synthetic user, to automatically chat with the agent. So we have to create that function. And the graph will be same, of course. The flow and the graph, the functions will be same. We just have to create a functionality that will automate the synthetic user to pass the message or the prompt or whatever, the query. Automatically, once it has received the agent response, then the user will automatically send That's the main rule over here. Because this is just a data. Sorry, I just clicked on Zoom. Yeah. So this is just, uh, you know, uh, the character or the character building thing. We can say, Oh, one thing we can do, we can, uh, I can just discard here. I can just come here. Uh, should I download this? Should I download this in CSV and directly, you know, or create a new table like the synthetic and import that thing? It will be much more easier.\n\n38:31 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. And then, um, and then just modify from there.\n\n38:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah. It's easy then because manually entering will take much more time.\n\n38:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. And just let's see CSV.\n\n38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. I just need to drop you.\n\n38:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. It has come here.\n\n39:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nSave.\n\n39:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, the primary key will be the ID, right? And yes, save.\n\n39:21 - Jorge Lewis \nCan I see the, the, the prop, the columns like that? You scroll down a little bit.\n\n39:33 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. We can create, uh, it's adding the column.\n\n39:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThe ID should be you, you ID.\n\n39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOK.\n\n39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nI think it's a little bit too late, but\n\n39:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt has added. OK. We can edit here.\n\n40:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think it won't change now.\n\n40:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, that's what I thought.\n\n40:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nCome on, come on, come on.\n\n40:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.

So that's one, one minute for us.\n\n59:25 - Jorge Lewis \nwe multiply it by a multiplier, not divide it. So 20 seconds for us, we multiply it by 100, that's 2,000 for them.\n\n59:44 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, all right, let's get into it. So you can open VS Code, share a live share link. So it's 1.30, we've already done an hour. Let's do 30 more minutes if you don't mind. Just so we can get some coding in.\n\n59:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, sure.\n\n1:00:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, I have sent in the chat.\n\n1:00:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you access it?\n\n1:00:57 - Jorge Lewis \nTrying now.\n\n1:01:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I create a column here that the last time maybe, because that's the starting point to write the function, the last time compared by the current time.\n\n1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, could you say that again? I was working on the VS code thing.\n\n1:01:37 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so I was telling like, we have to like, as I said, before, we have to add a time variable in the synthetic table, like the last run.\n\n1:01:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, last executed. Oh, yeah. So We can compare the last executed with the current time. And if that is not more than 24 hours, then that synthetic user won't execute. And if it is more than two hours or maybe equal to, then we can execute.\n\n1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, but what I would suggest is we ignore the time controlling first because that will expand the scope a lot and there's so many different edge cases to manage that it'll kind of not allow us to focus on getting something first. So we have this task, we have to make a simulation system. We need this system, we want to, we want to get something done, something that we can see the smallest thing that we can see is going to be one conversation back and forth. We don't need to worry about time. It's just a user having the synthetic user having a conversation with the ball. You can have a stop button so that they don't forever go on.\n\n1:03:03 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then later you can already be excited to see that you can have conversations. And, um, yeah.\n\n1:03:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n1:03:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo first thing, what should we start like with the super base creating functions or what else? What do you suggest?\n\n1:03:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I'll leave it up to you. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it up to you. You, you can think, okay, we've got a couple of things to do. I'm just picking one. Usually it works pretty well. Just starting. It's hard to find the right answer because they're all OK.\n\n1:03:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause the main thing that is coming to my mind is that function to create.\n\n1:04:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm thinking how to execute that.\n\n1:04:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so one thing we can do is and getting this for this. You we have to create a rag over here like the sorry the graph sorry the graph will be similar to this everything will be similar to this folder but that will make the easy and the starting point will be\n\n1:06:14 - Hasnain sayyed \ngraph Okay.\n\n1:06:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nEverything I think will be similar, uh, to this folder itself. Uh, just, uh, this folder is calling the real user. It will, in this folder, we will be calling the synthetic user. And additionally, uh, the top layer will be the edge case that we have talked like the time variable.\n\n1:06:35 - Jorge Lewis \nRight.\n\n1:06:37 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, we, I don't think so. Are you, are you suggesting we just copy and paste the AI folder?\n\n1:06:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, yes. Or I don't like, are you saying that the not copy pasting, like, uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain sayyed \na way to simulate time to control time based on time interval we can have the chatting with the synthetic like per day or one hour two hour maybe maybe even like per 10 minutes right oh yeah 10 minutes Um...\n\n19:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut over here, every synthetic user will have a different kind of personality, right? Like the few short.\n\n20:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I don't understand that part. I don't, I don't think so. Can you, can you kind of keep going?\n\n20:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. So, so like if admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic users, so each user which is created will have a similar kind of personality or like the talking or the chatting way, like the few shots that we are giving to each synthetic user, like the history or data or each synthetic user will have a different kind of knowledge.\n\n20:43 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, they, they should be mostly the same. So like, um, let me come up a little wireframe here. How do I, So we have, so we can give it name.\n\n21:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nWe can give it personality.\n\n21:14 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can give it goal. It's objective. So this, just a little note.\n\n21:25 - Jorge Lewis \nObjective is a behavior of adapt that the synthetic user is trying to test or exploit. What else?\n\n22:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess the profile information, so just the stuff that's in the super base in the profile table. So every user has, so we need to assign it like things like it's goal.\n\n22:32 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me just check. Ah, I'm going to have to sign in. But you get what I mean. Within the profile information, there's their goal, their Y, weight, height.\n\n22:57 - Jorge Lewis \nBasic onboarding.\n\n22:59 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, like all the information we gather from the onboarding, exactly. So what else?\n\n23:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess it's a list that we can copy from onboarding. So I think with that, there's probably going to be things that pop up that we can't see right now, but I think we might as well get started in this development. There's some things we can start on.\n\n23:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n23:30 - Jorge Lewis \nSo one thing, since we're working on the AI stuff only, for creating synthetics users, we can, since we don't want to work on any of the front end, we can just use directly in super base. We can manually create a table and manual create rows. All right. So I'll hand it off to you. Yeah. So we'll, There's different ways pair programming sessions work. You can do like pilot driver or what is it? Driver. I don't know, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you lead the way and I'm going to kind of chime in here and there.\n\n24:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So, uh, what things should I start with? Like\n\n24:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan we just create the flow like the first we will be working on this, then this, then this, because there are multiple things in this module.\n\n24:38 - Jorge Lewis \nLet's create a very basic system. So what do we need in order to simulate a conversation? What is the requirement?\n\n24:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe first thing is data, of course, because, uh, it is a fake user, first of all. So, uh, the table that you have created, we need that then the prompt, uh, the basic few short, like, uh, the knowledge, uh, on the basis of which the fake user will chat with the agent. So that's the main thing. And, uh, uh, the function functionality, like, uh, to automate this thing, uh, because, uh, the API only hits when, uh, event on click event will trigger. So we have to create a functionality for that. Uh, so that, uh, on each day, 10 minutes.\n\n25:24 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, the, the one where we, because the user we're not, we don't have a real user anymore. We're not sending a message. So we have our AI system and we have the user, but we probably use it more. So we're going to have to replace it with the synthetic user.\n\n25:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, correct. So that's what I'm telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.\n\n25:51 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n25:53 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, keep going. Which one? We're going to have to probably work and make, yeah.\n\n26:04 - Jorge Lewis \nYour voice is breaking. We're going to, we're going to have to work.\n\n26:09 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, it's cause I think\n######################\nOutput:"}}

TypeString is not assignable to type.\n\n2:02:02 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, wait, maybe...\n\n2:02:07 - Jorge Lewis \nUh, do. So I'm trying to figure out why I'm not getting those errors.\n\n2:02:17 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, but try, try the string. So go to the strings and do as tables and then.\n\n2:02:26 - Jorge Lewis \nWhere in the data type.\n\n2:02:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, so when you're setting the screen, no, no. So right where you are, right where you are back, you want to cast the string to the type. So. Synthetic underscore profiles as, and then tables synthetic profiles.

So the problem was that the problem is that we need to access either the synthetic profile or the user profile right there. We're only accessing the profile. We need, so the solution is to just move. So take a look. Let me share my screen.\n\n2:08:22 - Jorge Lewis \nLike the whole world, what we're solving, I feel like you kind of tunnel vision too much on what we're on the typing issue. The, what we're trying to do here is, is set this profile to either be from the synthetic profile or the profile list. That's what we were doing up here. So we were trying to set up. We're trying to do this and make it a variable, but instead we're just going to copy this and then paste it here. This profile here will either be from the synthetic profiles or the profiles.\n\n2:09:01 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. Well, I thought it can be.\n\n2:09:18 - Jorge Lewis \nOne thing we need to be careful of that maybe is that if there's any properties of these two that if profiles has something that synthetic profiles doesn't, then there might be an error at some point. I don't think so.\n\n2:09:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause it has copy paste.\n\n2:09:39 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt's the same.

Okay, so pretty much, do you understand the vision of ADAPT, the goal?\n\n5:58 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, so it's kind of 10 weeks framework. It will ask the goal of the user, like whether he wants to lose the weight or what's the motivation he wants within these 10 weeks. And during that, it will get the similar exercises. It will get the data, like the daily check-ins. And based on that, a performance review will be given to the user.\n\n6:26 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n6:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo that's the main part of the app. Sorry, that's the start of the app.\n\n6:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThe main part of the app, though, is after that, where we understand his goal and why he's trying to achieve it, and then we're going to help him do that. Because understanding his goal and helping him understand his goal is good, but now the main point of the app is to help him achieve it. All the features you can see on the page one. We have the reminders and nudges, the daily check-ins, the day-to-day mentoring, and the milestones. So these are the four main systems that are going to be used throughout the core app. So reminders and nudges, okay. Actually, this is a, follow me over.\n\n7:25 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, here, here. So this is the mentor.\n\n7:30 - Jorge Lewis \nMentor has three things to do.\n\n7:37 - Jorge Lewis \nHold up.\n\n7:46 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, I'll explain it like this. The core app has a mentor. The main agent that the user will be interacting with is the mentor. Sometimes when there's a dip in performance and the mentor gets notified by perhaps an analyst agent saying, hey, the user has been lacking on this. And then the mentor will say, okay, user, do you want to start a coaching session? And that's the coach's job. The coach's job is to go really in detail about why is the user lacking and not making progress towards their goals. What is stopping them? Do they have to update their goal? Do they have to agree on a new system, like some new practices they should do. Anyways, the mentor, his job is just facilitating everyday conversation. One of the main things that you guys were working on before was a daily check-in, right? So this is when you know about the day-to-day mentoring. All this is really is just the Everything other than the daily check-in, I think. It's kind of giving the mentor the ability to help the user and coach the user with simple things. So this will be mostly using data sources related to health, fitness, sleep, all those things so that he can provide advice. So I think this is mostly a very simple chatbot, the mentor. And then he has tools which can make him do a daily check-in.\n\n9:16 - Jorge Lewis \nAlthough this LMS feature, by the way, so initially Kuhn wanted to have an LMS, a learning management system. He wanted to, it was like kind of pretty separate to this whole app so that the, there's an LMS, the user watches a video every day and the mentor can ask the user, Hey, have you watched the video? Uh, but I don't know where Kuhn is on that right now. I think he's changed his mind a little bit since now this is becoming like a, the term he uses is a, um, is a health vault, I think, or health bank, something like that.\n\n9:50 - Jorge Lewis \nAre you familiar with the term? He just made it up, but he's been using that word a bit in the chat.\n\n10:01 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhich word?\n\n10:03 - Jorge Lewis \nHealth bank, I think.\n\n10:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nNo, I haven't heard that.\n\n10:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right.\n\n10:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut I know this LMS content like it will be recommending video based on the user past history.\n\n10:22 - Jorge Lewis \nNot recommending but just so there's there's one video every day for the user so the user picks a course I think there's gonna be multiple courses and they pick a course every day there's a new video that they have to watch. But I don't know if that's the case anymore. I don't know if Kuon has changed it or how he's been regarding that. We'll have to get updated on that.\n\n10:46 - Jorge Lewis \nThe rest of the system, reminders, milestones, these two are just very simple. What the mentor can do is remind the user.\n\n11:01 - Jorge Lewis \nthrough notifications, saying, for example, hey, your bedtime is in three hours, you shouldn't drink coffee, for example.\n\n11:12 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd the milestones are pretty much a way to motivate the user. So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So we can do type, uh, then back here.\n\n1:36:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. It's not profiled. It's it's in. Yeah, there is no S. Correct. And this we have to export over here.\n\n1:36:22 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n1:36:24 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, is this correct over here? System and then, or is this a tuple?\n\n1:36:31 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then I have to do prompts.\n\n1:36:34 - Jorge Lewis \nOr how was it before? Let me just copy this.\n\n1:36:39 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, it's a list. Oh, it's just the two, okay.\n\n1:36:44 - Jorge Lewis \nSo prompts teams, okay, so this is going to change from Like it's just prompt this is not gonna be using So how How should we go about structuring the profile structure? So if you see on my screen We have the prompt is Is it these three?\n\n1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis \nOr well, we're actually. Okay. So let me think.\n\n1:37:28 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this objective is, it can be just prompt. Personality can be part of the prompt and LM. Okay. Okay. So these two are just part of the prompt. So inside of the structure of here of synthetic profile, Should I re-upload the file?\n\n1:37:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause I have deleted.\n\n1:37:53 - Hasnain sayyed \nRe-upload the file? Which file?\n\n1:37:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe CSV from the profile. So we will be having the users in the synthetic one. Like, do you want- I think, I think.\n\n1:38:05 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:06 - Jorge Lewis \nGo ahead. Yes.\n\n1:38:09 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, you know what we could do to make it more dynamic and probably better, just a lot better code is within anywhere in the original code that's accessing the profile. So let me, let me go to man to kind of illustrate what I mean. So this function here is returning a profile, right?\n\n1:38:31 - Hasnain sayyed \nRight. Just a second. Yes.\n\n1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.\n\n1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt will be false for the default value\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over a number of days. So we present to the user saying, hey, you've reached a new milestone. You've walked 1,000 kilometers. That's like walking from France to Italy.\n\n11:56 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, one key aspect of making it very visual, the milestone. So not just, oh, you walked a thousand kilometers, like that doesn't mean anything. But instead of telling them they walked from France to Italy, that's like, oh, wow.\n\n12:07 - Unidentified Speaker \nSo.\n\n12:11 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, yeah, I hope that gives a good idea on the system, so.\n\n12:17 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what the system needs to accomplish is generate synthetic conversations so that admins can use them to improve the system through the prompts and adding reviews. The reviews is just a few-shot prompting. Are you familiar with them?\n\n12:31 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n12:31 - Jorge Lewis \nHave you seen them before?\n\n12:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n12:35 - Jorge Lewis \nSo it's just a few-shot prompting.\n\n12:39 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what we need to do, one complication is that we probably don't, well, hmm. Okay, no. So what this is going to entail is we need to create a, what do we call it? A synthetic user.\n\n13:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSo someone needs the ability.\n\n13:11 - Jorge Lewis \nAdmin needs the capability to create new synthetic users.\n\n13:25 - Jorge Lewis \nI got an idea what you are trying to say.\n\n13:26 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo synthetic user is basically a topic based thing, for example, based on different scenarios, the synthetic agent, you know, we can embed the few short and the prompts dynamically to that topic only. And the admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic agents. Is that what you are trying to point?\n\n14:08 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so I don't think so.\n\n14:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nI mean, you know, the URL for the project Like I just want to know what capabilities the synthetic user will have. Just simple.\n\n14:27 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So the synthetic user is all the synthetic users job or the synthetic user is really just the fake user, right? Does that make sense?\n\n14:37 - Jorge Lewis \nOh yeah. Makes sense.\n\n14:39 - Jorge Lewis \nBut so his old, his end goal for the synthetic user is to pretend to be a user and generates a, a synthetic conversation. So synthetic data. Okay. But there's some things, so for example, I want to, let me share my screen actually.\n\n15:09 - Jorge Lewis \nCan you see?\n\n15:10 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I can see.\n\n15:11 - Jorge Lewis \nDo you know the URL to the app?\n\n15:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nYes.\n\n15:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo let's send you.\n\n15:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nOh, yes, please.\n\n15:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nSend in the chat.\n\n15:43 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So, so here, wow, that's a lot of users. Um, so here is, is this is like kind of a, just a temporary kind of page for selecting a user where after we use user authentication, will be gone. But what I was thinking is, since these are all users, or actually, no this should probably be in the admin panel. So you see how I have to select profile when I want to modify the prompts.\n\n16:22 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what I'm thinking we do is somewhere on the sidebar, we can have a page called simulation. And in that simulation, we have a button. We can configure the synthetic user. So a synthetic user can have the properties of this. So we can tell it its main objective to test, and then What else? We can just give it some background, like personality. Or give it a user profile. Or goal, maybe.\n\n17:20 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so this is the goal, the main objective. So this can also be, This can be generic.\n\n17:36 - Jorge Lewis \nSo just no goal.\n\n17:41 - Jorge Lewis \nA synthetic user needs the prompt, it needs to understand, or we need to tell it who it is. So it's a user, or you are chatting with a life coach bot, you know, and tell it the thing. So we need to give it, tell it who it is and what.\n\n18:13 - Jorge Lewis \nYou are the person So, uh, hardships might be.\n\n18:32 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, so what we also need to do, which is quite important, is simulating multiple days because the chapel actually uses time.\n\n18:47 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need to make sure that... Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain\n######################\nOutput:"}}

But, but we have to think, yeah.\n\n30:07 - Jorge Lewis \nSo let's create one in the super base first.\n\n30:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo we have to create a new column for that, right? Because we don't have to merge the real users with the synthetic one.\n\n30:29 - Jorge Lewis \nOr what say?\n\n30:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nThat's what I was thinking as well.\n\n30:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nor just create a column here a new table or a new column right the column will identify like a real user or a synthetic user what say exactly what I was saying but my concern is that this table is\n\n30:49 - Jorge Lewis \nlinked to the chat one the id is linked to if you can see the um no it's linked to the users table that superbase uses for authentication So we can create a new profiles and you try to.\n\n31:12 - Jorge Lewis \nIf you tried to create a new row, it won't work like it because you need the ID needs to be linked to a insert the green button near the top.\n\n31:31 - Jorge Lewis \nthe green insert button above ID. I can draw on your screen, I think, right? No, let me see. I'm trying to see how I can color. Oh, you have it there.\n\n31:51 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, here we go.\n\n32:01 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm, I guess only you can.\n\n32:07 - Jorge Lewis \nBut do you see the insert button? It's green, near the top.\n\n32:17 - Jorge Lewis \nInsert button? Yeah.\n\n32:18 - Jorge Lewis \nA little bit left.\n\n32:21 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n32:22 - Jorge Lewis \nTry to insert row. And you'll see that the ID has a foreign key relation to the users table, which means that unless we create a new user in the users table using super-based authentication, we can't create a new row in this table. So that's going to prevent us from creating synthetic users like we might want to with that.\n\n32:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo like you proposed, I think we're going to have to make a new table. And even if we can later add just a column in the profile table, it takes five minutes, right? So it's better to kind of just start. So let's make a new table. Synthetic user or synthetic profile maybe to keep it the same.\n\n33:21 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I off this RLS, the rule level security because I think it's disabled. Yeah, turn it off, turn it off.\n\n33:33 - Jorge Lewis \nWe don't want to, it'll be, it'll be annoying. It just, the best practice is before you go to production, you want to turn all those on, but\n\n33:41 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm. Correct.\n\n33:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.\n\n33:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.\n\n34:05 - Hasnain\n######################\nOutput:"}}

But there's some things that need that all forms of communication from conflicts.\n\n1:22:46 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what I would like for me, if this were me, I would, I'm going to type it in your, in our person on the end, but don't, don't kind of, I don't want you to kind of take this as a fact, like just for me, how I would do it, right?\n\n1:23:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, basically I'll just try to get the essence of it and figure out the, how I'm going to write it in my own words.\n\n1:23:11 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, are you there?\n\n1:23:20 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYep. I think your internet is a little bit I think you cut out by there. Hello, hello. Can you hear me?

Yes, okay, okay. And then you can use that as inspiration. Everyone has their own style, so don't take it as like a fact.\n\n1:23:46 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, got it. Looking at it now.\n\n1:23:58 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n1:24:03 - Jorge Lewis \nHold on, my Wi-Fi is literally like...\n\n1:24:07 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, I'll turn off screen sharing for now.\n\n1:24:14 - Jorge Lewis \nHaha, thanks.\n\n1:24:17 - Jorge Lewis \nMan, this is the worst it's been so far. I don't know, bro, I'm in Hong Kong, one of the places with the fastest internet. I don't have like, I can't even do a voice, a video call.\n\n1:24:28 - Will Vincent Parrone \nJesus Christ, how much is the internet there?\n\n1:24:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nHello, hello, hello. Can you hear me, Jorge?\n\n1:24:47 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, bro, it's expensive. All data, right?\n\n1:24:52 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:24:53 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, God. We have like 10 seconds delay.\n\n1:24:58 - Jorge Lewis \nIt sounds like there's a big delay, though.\n\n1:25:09 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah. Maybe we can end this call now. And I work on the user sign-up flow for now in Figma.\n\n1:25:23 - Jorge Lewis \nIs it better now?\n\n1:25:25 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNot sure.\n\n1:25:45 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, have a nice day.\n\n1:25:46 - Unidentified Speaker \nBye-bye.\n\n1:25:55 - Will Vincent Parrone \nyou\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar.\n\n1:07:24 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:07:32 - Jorge Lewis \nIn the AI folder, there's one function that's being called somewhere, run. So inside run.\n\n1:07:43 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's one function that's been called run. This is to interact with the chatbot. We're here, we're passing it profile ID, we're passing it user message and user examples prompt. Profile ID is the only thing that's going to be different.\n\n1:08:05 - Jorge Lewis \nSo in, within synthetic user, what we need to do is somehow call this run function, right? Correct.\n\n1:08:11 - Unidentified Speaker \nCorrect.\n\n1:08:13 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, in essence, we need to call the run function.\n\n1:08:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo, and the top layer will just be the like, the edge case function that I have talked like one day, one conversation, like one day, one session, the top layer will be that the edge case condition. And we just have to create a loop over here because in this file, it's just a one case scenario, like a one way scenario. It's not a loop where it's just a HTTP request, like pointing, running this function and getting the return for one conversation. But we have to create a loop kind of thing over here.\n\n1:08:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nBased on time.\n\n1:08:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAs we discussed, 30 seconds or 1 minute.\n\n1:09:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAs I said, we have to reduce the scope right now. We want to focus on one thing right now. When you're developing software, if you're worrying about all the 30 different things that have to be made, You're never going to make one thing. Right now, we want to get a conversation happening between the bot and the user. Then we can worry about adding in time into the code. So we need to isolate small things to make.\n\n1:09:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I copy paste this thing over here?\n\n1:09:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThis function? No, no.\n\n1:09:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nI just have to change this thing. The user message will be not the parameter itself. It will be the previous. We will be getting it from the database or the few short.\n\n1:10:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhat do you mean, few short?\n\n1:10:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe database, like the prompt that a Q1 is adding from the dashboard.\n\n1:10:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe user message will be, in the real use case, will be passed by the real user, right? But in the synthetic user, it doesn't have any, like, the user message from the real user. We have to get it from database, which will be in the scenario of future.\n\n1:10:36 - Jorge Lewis \nFor the synthetic user, we should be using a language model. There should be an agent.\n\n1:10:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nOK.\n\n1:10:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo based on the- Yeah.\n\n1:10:55 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause we're trying to pretend this guy's a user. There's no reason not to use a language model. We're trying to create new data, not reuse old data.\n\n1:11:11 - Jorge Lewis \nGot it.\n\n1:11:13 - Jorge Lewis \nI was just saying- So I'm going to try to kind of start you off and see if it makes sense. So we have this run function that's being called by the dev bot. Let's go into the simple dev user. Let's import that function.\n\n1:11:34 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me enable my copilot.\n\n1:11:57 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, my co-pilot subscription ended.\n\n1:12:28 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then here, we know we want to call run. What are the properties?\n\n1:12:41 - Jorge Lewis \nThese are profile ID, so it's a string ID. What else?\n\n1:12:53 - Jorge Lewis \nUser message.\n\n1:12:56 - Jorge Lewis \nSo we need to message to do AI generated message.\n\n1:13:07 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then use example prompts just do hmm. What does that mean?\n\n1:13:12 - Unidentified Speaker \nOh?\n\n1:13:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt's just a boolean template.\n\n1:13:17 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah false okay, so So we have this here const ID is So we need to get this ID from a We need to get this ID from SuperBase.\n\n1:13:39 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, so just right here, maybe.\n\n1:13:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for now, let's use a hard-coded ID. So I'm going to go into SuperBase and\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So I realized if we move the button or the toggle to the right side, it'll make things a lot easier. We don't have to worry about the data table stuff.\n\n47:50 - Jorge Lewis \nBut if you want to learn more about the data table and how it works, I'm more than happy to.\n\n47:58 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, cool. I already suffered.\n\n48:03 - Jorge Lewis \nI need to learn a bit more about it as well. But the only thing is I haven't had the time to learn it properly.\n\n48:12 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, me too. Let me try to remember the last thing I did. Okay, here we go. Basically, I'm going to be copy pasting this.\n\n48:27 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSince this is a boolean one, create render.\n\n48:32 - Will Vincent Parrone \nRelative dates. And I'm going to be Copying this one.\n\n48:43 - Will Vincent Parrone \nCopy relative date. So let's call this relative to do.\n\n48:49 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, it's actually already there. It's started, I think. Dang it. Okay.\n\n49:03 - Jorge Lewis \nOn a general note, I wonder if it's a good practice to suffix the files that are cells, like with a dash cell, I wonder. I don't know.\n\n49:12 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI mean, it's for readability purposes. It's always a good thing.\n\n49:20 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLet's call this then. Let's call the done button. Let's see what happens.\n\n49:27 - Will Vincent Parrone \nRelative.\n\n49:38 - Jorge Lewis \nLike, see, for... Do you have GitHub Copilot in general, or...?\n\n49:41 - Unidentified Speaker \nHuh?\n\n49:43 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry?\n\n49:44 - Jorge Lewis \nDo you have GitHub Copilot?\n\n49:48 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNo.\n\n49:51 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI am only using a language server here.\n\n50:01 - Will Vincent Parrone \nRelativeDateCell... RelativeDateCell... What's the name of this again? DoneButton... ItemValue...\n\n50:18 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat's the, uh... Okay, ID...\n\n50:27 - Will Vincent Parrone \nItem.ID...\n\n50:38 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'm not sure if actually this is correct.\n\n50:52 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, I think this is lead.\n\n50:57 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNo, what is this?\n\n50:59 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I actually tried working on this at some point, but I don't know what happens.\n\n51:16 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, let's see. What is data body cell? Data body cell.\n\n51:25 - Will Vincent Parrone \nTable color, I know you're rendering an item, so the thing I would have to do is find out what contains the lead.\n\n51:37 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay.\n\n51:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah.\n\n51:46 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNevermind, that's a dead end. Insert columns, table, create columns, status, assessor, status. Property done does not exist.\n\n51:57 - Unidentified Speaker \nData.\n\n51:59 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what's item.value?\n\n52:01 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat is it? What is...\n\n52:06 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, wait. Have you... No, you just... I think it's because you haven't... It hasn't updated your types yet, your ID.\n\n52:\n######################\nOutput:"}}

I copy pasted the same.\n\n2:09:42 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt has all of the properties.\n\n2:09:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.\n\n2:09:46 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. Cool. All right. So I'll just push this in.\n\n2:10:02 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, go ahead and pull. And yeah, I'm a hop off. It's been a great session. I think very productive.\n\n2:10:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think we learned a lot.\n\n2:10:11 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for now, I guess just keep working on this and then, um, and then, yeah, keep me updated. So it's clear what the objectives are, right. And how we should move forward with this.\n\n2:10:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. So for now, uh, we will be using the loop, right. Uh, for, uh, iterating for the 10 times.\n\n2:10:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nOr should I create a function? OK.\n\n2:10:38 - Jorge Lewis \nJust do that for now. And then once we can see something on the screen, then we'll move forward. We need to do it step by step, because it's a very big issue that most new developers have, is that they try to make the whole application And then it takes them three months and within that three months they never finish something that they can test. Not test as in make unit tests, not test as in no errors. Test as in see the experience so it's very important that we that when we're making these projects and you're developing is you focus on very small things that you can test as an end and you so in this case what we can test as an end user the smallest thing is we can see a AI the synthetic user having a conversation with a chatbot that's all we need like we all we need to see is they can send messages to each other basic that's it hmm And then after we can see that, then we work on expanding it little by little. But it's very important that we see the progress through the testing that like with the end user.\n\n2:11:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. Okay. I will work on this and make it as functional as a basic level and then we can move step by step.\n\n2:11:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, cool.\n\n2:12:01 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, I think you'll have to work with, um, I think you'll have to work with one of the front-end developers to get the front-end for this done. So whether Will or Nazif, kind of bring them both in a call and ask and demonstrate or tell them, hey, we have this new task. How can we go about working on this? Check who's busy or who's not.\n\n2:12:27 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Okay. I will ask them right now.\n\n2:12:33 - Jorge Lewis \ndoing this programming session. Looking forward to the ones to come. I think it's a great way to keep growing.\n\n2:12:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.\n\n2:12:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nCorrect then. I will update you once I will get our achieving done.

All right.\n\n0:23 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so let's start from the top. So this is the division mission workshop for content.\n\n0:33 - Jorge Lewis \nLet's make sure we're on the same page. So today we're just going to align on those two things. Here's a quick example of what the vision and mission are. The mission is explaining why are we trying to build this? What problem is it solving? And then what is the solution? So building an online platform to solve this problem. So yeah, so let's get into the mission. So with a mission, what we'll do first is have me say off the top of my head, the problem we're trying to solve.\n\n1:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, PO, project owner, will explain how the idea behind the project was conceived, what problem arised that gave him the idea of IntelliO.\n\n1:20 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so the project was conceived because the past two weeks or three weeks I have spent a lot of effort and time into writing, trying to write content, but haven't gotten anywhere.\n\n1:38 - Jorge Lewis \nNumber one, I like writing, I like that aspect, but it just takes too much time to write things on paper or on Notion or whatever, to put things down.\n\n1:51 - Jorge Lewis \nIt takes a lot of mental effort and time to get those onto paper and then into a script or whatever.\n\n1:59 - Jorge Lewis \nSo like I've tried writing content and just hasn't worked out I have time for it, but I just I'm I guess I'm It's too much effort I guess you could say I have better things to do than writing content\n\n2:11 - Biwas bhandari \nor at least yeah But if content yeah sometimes you feel like, okay, I want to write about this, but you cannot start writing in the copy about all the scripts.\n\n2:26 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's a form of writer's block, but also, yeah. Kind of procrastination, but it's like I have better things to do. I'm not I'm gonna save this for later. So procrastination Okay, so with that said let's take just two minutes to notes our interpretation of what I just said and then What the mission is I think you've already done it, but if you want to try again Yeah, I think my one links with your Alright, I've got mine.\n\n3:23 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay, yeah. I finished mine too.\n\n3:26 - Jorge Lewis \nAlright, so Marina, why is yours the same color?\n\n3:30 - Biwas bhandari \nLet me change it.\n\n3:34 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay, thanks.\n\n3:35 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so let's read yours. So the project owner will usually read his out first, I believe. Reduce time and efforts required to write content. So that's what I put. And for yours, the mission of the product is to help make content and brainstorm about it. The problem is, is it takes a lot of time to brainstorm about the content I'm making and the current AI tools congeneration is not it. Okay, that's perfect. Your one's great.\n\n4:03 - Biwas bhandari \nNo, yours one is like my summarized form.\n\n4:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so one thing we noticed in the last one when we did this with Jonas was his was too many things.

And then what we do is we bring it here, and we get a new note, and we put the mission.\n\n4:41 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd under, the mission. Okay, so we can shorten here. So the mission of the product is to help make content um creation and ideation so ideation is the brainstorm part um faster and or is to make it easier so faster and less mental effort okay because that's that's the problem okay So this part's a good point. The current AI tools for content generation is not good, but I don't think it doesn't belong in the mission. So I'll just bring that over and paste it somewhere here.\n\n5:40 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so the mission of the product is, so we don't have to say this, so help. So, or not help, just make content creation, content creation and ideation, Why is it saying ideation is not a word? I think it is. Yeah, it is. It's the formation of ideas or concepts, but all right then, buddy. Make content creation and ideation easier, faster by requiring... Okay, just by making it faster and require less mental effort. Okay, cool.\n\n6:23 - Jorge Lewis \nNow on to the vision. So P.O.\n\n6:36 - Jorge Lewis \nAfterwards, P.O. And then P.O.\n\n6:43 - Jorge Lewis \nSo P.O. Will give a high level explanation of his idea and vision of the project. Afterwards, I'll invite everyone to write down their motivation behind working on the project.\n\n6:56 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I invite everyone? What do you mean?\n\n7:04 - Jorge Lewis \nI'm just going to tell everyone.

All right.\n\n0:23 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so let's start from the top. So this is the division mission workshop for content.\n\n0:33 - Jorge Lewis \nLet's make sure we're on the same page. So today we're just going to align on those two things. Here's a quick example of what the vision and mission are. The mission is explaining why are we trying to build this? What problem is it solving? And then what is the solution? So building an online platform to solve this problem. So yeah, so let's get into the mission. So with a mission, what we'll do first is have me say off the top of my head, the problem we're trying to solve.\n\n1:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, PO, project owner, will explain how the idea behind the project was conceived, what problem arised that gave him the idea of IntelliO.\n\n1:20 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so the project was conceived because the past two weeks or three weeks I have spent a lot of effort and time into writing, trying to write content, but haven't gotten anywhere.\n\n1:38 - Jorge Lewis \nNumber one, I like writing, I like that aspect, but it just takes too much time to write things on paper or on Notion or whatever, to put things down.\n\n1:51 - Jorge Lewis \nIt takes a lot of mental effort and time to get those onto paper and then into a script or whatever.\n\n1:59 - Jorge Lewis \nSo like I've tried writing content and just hasn't worked out I have time for it, but I just I'm I guess I'm It's too much effort I guess you could say I have better things to do than writing content\n\n2:11 - Biwas bhandari \nor at least yeah But if content yeah sometimes you feel like, okay, I want to write about this, but you cannot start writing in the copy about all the scripts.\n\n2:26 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's a form of writer's block, but also, yeah. Kind of procrastination, but it's like I have better things to do. I'm not I'm gonna save this for later. So procrastination Okay, so with that said let's take just two minutes to notes our interpretation of what I just said and then What the mission is I think you've already done it, but if you want to try again Yeah, I think my one links with your Alright, I've got mine.\n\n3:23 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay, yeah. I finished mine too.\n\n3:26 - Jorge Lewis \nAlright, so Marina, why is yours the same color?\n\n3:30 - Biwas bhandari \nLet me change it.\n\n3:34 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay, thanks.\n\n3:35 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so let's read yours. So the project owner will usually read his out first, I believe. Reduce time and efforts required to write content. So that's what I put. And for yours, the mission of the product is to help make content and brainstorm about it. The problem is, is it takes a lot of time to brainstorm about the content I'm making and the current AI tools congeneration is not it. Okay, that's perfect. Your one's great.\n\n4:03 - Biwas bhandari \nNo, yours one is like my summarized form.\n\n4:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so one thing we noticed in the last one when we did this with Jonas was his was too many things.

Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yep, yep, I can hear you.\n\n55:10 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, is he with us?\n\n55:16 - Jorge Lewis \nWait.\n\n55:17 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, we're not programming session real quick. We're tired of being bothered. I'll get back to you when we're done in like... 30 minutes-ish?\n\n55:30 - Jorge Lewis \nIs he awake?\n\n55:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, he'll reply to you.\n\n55:35 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, yeah, could you deal with that? Maybe try.\n\n55:50 - Will Vincent Parrone \nScrew it, I'll see if it works. I'll refresh.\n\n55:59 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, I see, internal error. Okay, what the hell did I do? What the hell did I do?\n\n56:19 - Jorge Lewis \nTry again, I guess, I don't know, cuz it's a little bit, what even happened?\n\n56:24 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI don't know, is my server getting half plug-in code VSS did?\n\n56:31 - Will Vincent Parrone \nMaybe a stop overflow or something, let me try. Item.done. What the fuck is this?\n\n56:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll be right back, I'm gonna use the restroom.\n\n56:49 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYep.\n\n58:39 - Will Vincent Parrone \nso let's see let's see let's see prospect username status discover dot header done what did I do wrong So why didn't item.done work?\n\n59:14 - Will Vincent Parrone \nBoth of them did not work. I tried item.done. I'll try to check.\n\n59:21 - Jorge Lewis \nMaybe casting item.done as a boolean?\n\n59:25 - Unidentified Speaker \nNo.\n\n59:33 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, wait. No.\n\n59:35 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLet me try to smash this first.\n\n59:44 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, get diff. What did I do wrong? What did I change? Okay, the spacings...\n\n59:53 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI changed the spacings. Oh no, this is not gonna help me.\n\n59:58 - Unidentified Speaker \nGod\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar.\n\n1:07:24 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:07:32 - Jorge Lewis \nIn the AI folder, there's one function that's being called somewhere, run. So inside run.\n\n1:07:43 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's one function that's been called run. This is to interact with the chatbot. We're here, we're passing it profile ID, we're passing it user message and user examples prompt. Profile ID is the only thing that's going to be different.\n\n1:08:05 - Jorge Lewis \nSo in, within synthetic user, what we need to do is somehow call this run function, right? Correct.\n\n1:08:11 - Unidentified Speaker \nCorrect.\n\n1:08:13 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, in essence, we need to call the run function.\n\n1:08:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo, and the top layer will just be the like, the edge case function that I have talked like one day, one conversation, like one day, one session, the top layer will be that the edge case condition. And we just have to create a loop over here because in this file, it's just a one case scenario, like a one way scenario. It's not a loop where it's just a HTTP request, like pointing, running this function and getting the return for one conversation. But we have to create a loop kind of thing over here.\n\n1:08:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nBased on time.\n\n1:08:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAs we discussed, 30 seconds or 1 minute.\n\n1:09:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAs I said, we have to reduce the scope right now. We want to focus on one thing right now. When you're developing software, if you're worrying about all the 30 different things that have to be made, You're never going to make one thing. Right now, we want to get a conversation happening between the bot and the user. Then we can worry about adding in time into the code. So we need to isolate small things to make.\n\n1:09:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I copy paste this thing over here?\n\n1:09:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThis function? No, no.\n\n1:09:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nI just have to change this thing. The user message will be not the parameter itself. It will be the previous. We will be getting it from the database or the few short.\n\n1:10:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhat do you mean, few short?\n\n1:10:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe database, like the prompt that a Q1 is adding from the dashboard.\n\n1:10:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe user message will be, in the real use case, will be passed by the real user, right? But in the synthetic user, it doesn't have any, like, the user message from the real user. We have to get it from database, which will be in the scenario of future.\n\n1:10:36 - Jorge Lewis \nFor the synthetic user, we should be using a language model. There should be an agent.\n\n1:10:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nOK.\n\n1:10:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo based on the- Yeah.\n\n1:10:55 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause we're trying to pretend this guy's a user. There's no reason not to use a language model. We're trying to create new data, not reuse old data.\n\n1:11:11 - Jorge Lewis \nGot it.\n\n1:11:13 - Jorge Lewis \nI was just saying- So I'm going to try to kind of start you off and see if it makes sense.

So I actually thought about this as well. What's the, let's take a look at the front end real quick. And instead of trying, there's an easy way and there's a hard way, I realized. So the left side there is a data table. It's using ChefCN. It's pretty complex compared to the right side, which is straight up just very simple stuff. So I realized if we move the button or the toggle to the right side, it'll make things a lot easier.

All right, everyone, let's do this now.\n\n7:08 - Jorge Lewis \nAfter everyone is done, we'll collaborate, collaboratively compare all the ideas. Yeah. Okay. So. The vision, so this is really, this is great when you have a lot of like more than a few people. When it's two people, it's, it's very fast and there's only two things. So it's not too much to worry about, which is why I asked Jonas if he could join, because he could give more input. So.\n\n7:33 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So the idea, so what I imagine this is, and the vision is kind of the end goal of this entire project. It's not a It can be like the very end goal. So for example, for, for adapt, it could be the vision is a chatbot can help coach the user to build habits.\n\n8:04 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n8:06 - Jorge Lewis \nTo build good habits. I think that's it. That's the vision. A chatbot building good habits for users.\n\n8:13 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. How we do that, there's a lot of different ways, but that's the end goal. The chapel will help users build habits. So for this one, what I think, what I like this project to become, well, is I can sit, so I'm going to kind of just draw a story. So I want to wake up, have my coffee. And this is when I usually like to write or do my creative things. Cause I'm just, I've got my coffee. It's morning. I want to be in the chair and just.\n\n8:41 - Jorge Lewis \nlike have content there that I just refine. So content is generated and I can refine it. And that content is something I agree with. It's in the style that I like, It doesn't sound like AI at all. And to convert it into an actual post or script, it's not a lot of work. Meaning I only have to change some small things. It doesn't have to be perfect, of course. Well, I mean, of course Google is perfect. I ask it to make something about a topic and it'll tell me, it'll run me through a process to create the content. For example, I want to make a video about the best way to build a SaaS as a non-technical person.\n\n9:33 - Jorge Lewis \nI want it to know what my opinions are on that whole topic. And if it doesn't, I want it to ask me, okay, what do you think about this? What about this? What about this? To build a knowledge base around this whole topic so that it can understand how I would write this. Because a lot of content is so opinion-based. Building fact-based content is very easy. You can research things and find facts.\n\n9:59 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat people are after for content is experienced people that have done it before that can use their experience to provide advice. And I would say I have some experience that I want to be sharing. Instead of just kind of regurgitating everything like, oh, you should raise funding and then you should do this. Like kind of the very basic things. I don't want it to be that. I don't want this project to be a regurgitation of a Google search.

Have you got the point?\n\n43:43 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so you see my screen share.\n\n43:59 - Jorge Lewis \nWe have input fields for the prompt We have input fields for the prompt so they They can go in here and modify the prompts in the same way. I think we can modify the prompts of the the characteristics of the the Synthetic guy. So for example, what I can do is I'll I'll kind of, actually let me take a screenshot of this. So what I want is a button here that says synthetic users. Something like this maybe. And when it opens it, let me just kind of make this empty.\n\n44:53 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so pretend like I've just, there. So here, what I think we can do is have, so I think what we'll have is two tabs. We'll have manage users.\n\n45:24 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then we'll have a new user.\n\n45:33 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the managed users, what it's going to do is help with being able to remove, or actually just, okay, I have an idea actually. So when you go to, synthetic users, the UI will look like a table with all of the properties. And then we can have a button at the top. Can I move this? A button at the top.\n\n46:14 - Jorge Lewis \nAdd new synthetic user. And when you click this, it opens a pop-up.\n\n46:25 - Jorge Lewis \nnew pop-up or a model like yeah a model model yeah what do we see and then we have we can give it a new name hmm so pretty much all of it So we get a new name, a new personality, the objective.\n\n47:02 - Jorge Lewis \nThis one can be null. So I guess all of them can be null and we can have a default.\n\n47:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n47:21 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for example, the objective, when it's default, could literally be nothing. We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This is what Q1 had said. Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up. So basically, people from the newsletter would be signing in. Should we do some kind of creating an account if a person came from the newsletter, like the workflow of it?\n\n1:16:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, described, so we're still, I feel like we're still aligned. I feel like he just misinterpreted what we do. So in FigJam, make a user flow of this user process and use these images here. So create a user flow saying, okay, and it's already there online on FigJam. If you open the depth spec, there's actually a section for the user flow, just called discovery. And in that discovery, what you should do is kind of duplicate it. Can you open FigJam?\n\n1:17:01 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see.\n\n1:17:19 - Will Vincent Parrone \nHere we go.\n\n1:17:24 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I duplicate the discovery section over here, full user auth flow. In here, search and expand upon it to create the full version with the technical thing. So saying, signs up, replacing that with more in-depth things like how they sign up.\n\n1:17:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nAnd then reply to them, yeah.\n\n1:17:49 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSounds like a plan to me then.\n\n1:17:51 - Jorge Lewis \nI think, let them know, say, um, that sounds, that sounds right. Let me make a FigDem to make, to double check.\n\n1:18:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:18:02 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll message them on Discord then. Wait, let me message Kuan now to see if I get what you're saying.\n\n1:18:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nJust to make sure that we're also perfectly aligned, I'll be creating a user on how the sign up experience would look like,\n\n1:18:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSounds like a plan.\n\n1:18:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nincluding again.\n\n1:19:00 - Unidentified Speaker \nYep.\n\n1:19:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThis looks good to me. Anything else?\n\n1:19:07 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me check the message out.\n\n1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis \nSo your message, it doesn't feel like, so I mean, he says perfect, but for me, it would be even more clear for sure thing. Like that, It just sounds like all you're saying, it sounds like he said something and then all you said was yes. But what does yes mean? Does it mean yes, that's what we have in mind or yes, I'm going to change my mind? Yes, thanks for the clarification. So when we say sure thing, what do you mean by that?\n\n1:19:44 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI just basically, I'm just basically saying that I understand. I'll keep note of what you've said. That's what I meant by sure thing.\n\n1:20:00 - Jorge Lewis \nBut we don't want to be just keeping note. We want to make sure that we can give more than that. So for example, he says, this is what we've discussed. How does that interact with what you guys are planning? It's pointless to say, I understand, just as a first thing.\n\n1:20:27 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause there's things that we need to clear up.\n\n1:20:32 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can't avoid the conflict of having cleared things up. That's what it feels like, Because there's a conflict which is, we talked about the UX being via the mentor chat with action buttons. Do you understand what he means?\n\n1:20:45 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI think right now, he is talking about the mockups.\n\n1:20:54 - Jorge Lewis \nWait.\n\n1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the answer is no. It doesn't sound like you know what he means. Neither do I. Like, I don't know exactly what he means. So it's, we can't just say yes. We're better off to saying, okay, to make sure that we're aligned. Like don't, because saying it's, um, it's like a false sense of security for him. And it's bad because if he thinks, if it creates an assumption that we understand, and then later down the road, it could bite us in the ass. This one specific example may not be the case, but for things like this, I've definitely seen it happen. I wouldn't be stressing it as much if I didn't see this happen before.\n\n1:21:38 - Jorge Lewis \nIf you feel what I'm saying.\n\n1:21:40 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, okay. I hear what you're saying.\n\n1:21:48 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSo, what are the improvements that you think I should do, like, It's not on how I voice my messages. I think it's being a bit more inquisitive. Questioning, I suppose.\n\n1:22:02 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, of course, it depends on your style then.\n\n1:22:14 - Will Vincent Parrone \nMm-hmm.\n\n1:22:21 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSorry.\n\n1:\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Where's the\n\n1:42:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nHow should we add?\n\n1:42:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nLet me try.\n\n1:42:36 - Jorge Lewis \nBye.\n\n1:43:03 - Jorge Lewis \nYes, I mean, if we use...\n\n1:43:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, have you found the solution?\n\n1:43:12 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, not yet, but just kind of to think it through, this does take in a string, or it ends up being a string, but it's just typed differently. So maybe, or maybe actually. We can use this code.\n\n1:43:38 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:43:41 - Jorge Lewis \nSo if I put the string, if I do this, it works.\n\n1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis \nBut I want to reuse this variable profile table since we… I think use it down? Oh no, it's just once.\n\n1:44:06 - Jorge Lewis \nWe're only asking, we're only making the simple base request once, so I guess we can use this, but I wonder maybe we should figure it out instead of\n\n1:44:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nLet me try one thing.\n\n1:45:02 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah.\n\n1:45:33 - Hasnain sayyed \nThat's it.\n\n1:46:00 - Hasnain sayyed \nAt 10 o'clock, she would get up and leave. What? Again? She would leave at 2.30 in the morning. You would come at 8.30?\n\n1:46:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nNo, no. She would come at 6.30 in the morning. She would come at 8.30 the morning. Sometimes, she would come late at night. She would come late at night and leave early in the morning. She would leave early in the morning. I would come at the 8.30 morning. She would come at 8.30 in the morning. I would eat and leave.\n\n1:46:33 - Hasnain sayyed \nYou think he made any progress?\n\n1:47:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nI don't know.\n\n1:47:31 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think that's better actually.\n\n1:47:57 - Jorge Lewis \nBut I can't tell because my screen doesn't show me the correct things.\n\n1:48:15 - Jorge Lewis \nShowing you any errors? Yeah.\n\n1:48:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think we both are in different areas.\n\n1:48:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nTables, it's not as stable, I think.\n\n1:48:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I think month of dates.\n\n1:48:\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He's like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I've met. It's a matter of, oh, don't use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.\n\n39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's actually a good compromise.\n\n39:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause in today's world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it's a good kind of reminder. Oh, but trust me, I felt so cool using NeoVim in the airport. In the airplane, I was like, yeah, the people behind me can see me just using Vim. I bet they use Windows. I bet they use VS Code.\n\n40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat's this? Exit your status entry.\n\n40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see the web and px super basic. Yeah, anyways, the problem that I'm trying to fix is basically when determining whether the types here in the superbase.ts are accurate.\n\n40:32 - Jorge Lewis \nI would update them regardless.\n\n40:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThey should be, but just, yeah, never hurts. Actually, I can do it for you just to double check in case you're having too many problems.\n\n41:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll Shift-C, Alt-Tab, V, superbase.com, continue with GitHub.\n\n41:16 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWell done, now close this window. And then...\n\n41:26 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWe copy, exit, and then...\n\n41:33 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSo we go bash, update superbase tags.\n\n41:38 - Will Vincent Parrone \nHmm.

But one thing that I've noticed is that for people using Vim and Linux, you're often fixing your operating system and your tools rather than developing. I think that's one of the biggest arguments.\n\n42:30 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIt's basically a personal attack, but it's accurate to...\n\n42:37 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLike, fuck you, but like, yeah, that is us.\n\n42:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, the types are updated, so don't worry.\n\n42:48 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, let me try to pull.\n\n42:50 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, wait, let me push. I have changes here, though.\n\n43:00 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's quite a- Bewis is still learning. He's using a lot of tri-catches, so... Prepare your eyes. If you don't, yeah.\n\n43:10 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, don't worry, I also use tri-catch. If it works, it works.\n\n43:15 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThat has been my mentality. Wait, let me just...\n\n43:23 - Jorge Lewis \nI hate this saying because it's just so cliche, but everything's a balance.\n\n43:55 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat's happening with my... Ah, anyways.\n\n44:03 - Jorge Lewis \nLook at how inefficient you are, you don't have a shortcut to nvim, just vi. Come on.\n\n44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNow my vim is lagging like crazy.\n\n44:14 - Jorge Lewis \nIt was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn't set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it's like two characters doesn't make you more efficient, but it's just so funny. I don't know. It's like the inside the head of a developer. We're going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we're satisfied.\n\n44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, that is us.\n\n44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, okay. I'm just going to pull if there are any changes. Wow. Okay. This is from Alpha 2.\n\n45:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLet me see what has changed.\n\n45:14 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'm getting a bit dyslexic. Let's see. To do.

And I haven't added that done to, The leads table. So I'm going to do that right now. So you're going to have to actually...\n\n45:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThat explains it.

So these are the four main systems that are going to be used throughout the core app. So reminders and nudges, okay. Actually, this is a, follow me over.\n\n7:25 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, here, here. So this is the mentor.\n\n7:30 - Jorge Lewis \nMentor has three things to do.\n\n7:37 - Jorge Lewis \nHold up.\n\n7:46 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, I'll explain it like this. The core app has a mentor. The main agent that the user will be interacting with is the mentor. Sometimes when there's a dip in performance and the mentor gets notified by perhaps an analyst agent saying, hey, the user has been lacking on this. And then the mentor will say, okay, user, do you want to start a coaching session? And that's the coach's job. The coach's job is to go really in detail about why is the user lacking and not making progress towards their goals. What is stopping them? Do they have to update their goal? Do they have to agree on a new system, like some new practices they should do. Anyways, the mentor, his job is just facilitating everyday conversation. One of the main things that you guys were working on before was a daily check-in, right? So this is when you know about the day-to-day mentoring. All this is really is just the Everything other than the daily check-in, I think. It's kind of giving the mentor the ability to help the user and coach the user with simple things. So this will be mostly using data sources related to health, fitness, sleep, all those things so that he can provide advice. So I think this is mostly a very simple chatbot, the mentor. And then he has tools which can make him do a daily check-in.\n\n9:16 - Jorge Lewis \nAlthough this LMS feature, by the way, so initially Kuhn wanted to have an LMS, a learning management system. He wanted to, it was like kind of pretty separate to this whole app so that the, there's an LMS, the user watches a video every day and the mentor can ask the user, Hey, have you watched the video? Uh, but I don't know where Kuhn is on that right now. I think he's changed his mind a little bit since now this is becoming like a, the term he uses is a, um, is a health vault, I think, or health bank, something like that.\n\n9:50 - Jorge Lewis \nAre you familiar with the term? He just made it up, but he's been using that word a bit in the chat.\n\n10:01 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhich word?\n\n10:03 - Jorge Lewis \nHealth bank, I think.\n\n10:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nNo, I haven't heard that.\n\n10:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right.\n\n10:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut I know this LMS content like it will be recommending video based on the user past history.\n\n10:22 - Jorge Lewis \nNot recommending but just so there's there's one video every day for the user so the user picks a course I think there's gonna be multiple courses and they pick a course every day there's a new video that they have to watch. But I don't know if that's the case anymore. I don't know if Kuon has changed it or how he's been regarding that. We'll have to get updated on that.\n\n10:46 - Jorge Lewis \nThe rest of the system, reminders, milestones, these two are just very simple. What the mentor can do is remind the user.\n\n11:01 - Jorge Lewis \nthrough notifications, saying, for example, hey, your bedtime is in three hours, you shouldn't drink coffee, for example.\n\n11:12 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd the milestones are pretty much a way to motivate the user. So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Correct.\n\n33:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.\n\n33:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.\n\n34:05 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you copy paste over here? It will be fast. Like the name of columns, because it needs to be similar.\n\n34:18 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, um, I'm still trying to sign into the super basic account. Um, does super base have like sign in with, uh, Google?\n\n34:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, it has.\n\n34:37 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, that's exactly, but I can't see it.\n\n34:41 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, no, I mean like, it's its own platform.\n\n34:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nOh, so I don't think so.\n\n35:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOr else I can copy paste over here.\n\n35:10 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, Oh, there we go. I'm in. Nice.\n\n35:41 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm just writing the column attribute. So I just copy paste.\n\n35:51 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat I want to note on though, what I want to note on is that this synthetic user for example first name and last name hmm they don't need to be separate I think what do you think like or actually\n\n36:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nhuh actually no they do yeah I think it needs to be identical to the profile table yeah yeah um Because the functions, uh, if they're going to be using the first name, it's not using, uh, it's needs to be similar because there will be other, uh, the data is null. Okay.\n\n36:32 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, exactly. So what I've also noticed though, is that the code right now is using, um, is using the profiles table, right? So if we want to make it use the Profiles table or the synthetic user table without having to rewrite all the code Should we use like an if state like should we in the request to call the AI? That we probably need to add a parameter or something like synthetic so that we can add an add a an if operation so like if this is synthetic use the The synthetic table does that make sense?\n\n37:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah, I What I am thinking is, while the first flow, the Q1 created the synthetic user, then we have to create an external function which gets the ability for that agent, the synthetic user, to automatically chat with the agent. So we have to create that function. And the graph will be same, of course. The flow and the graph, the functions will be same. We just have to create a functionality that will automate the synthetic user to pass the message or the prompt or whatever, the query. Automatically, once it has received the agent response, then the user will automatically send That's the main rule over here. Because this is just a data. Sorry, I just clicked on Zoom. Yeah. So this is just, uh, you know, uh, the character or the character building thing. We can say, Oh, one thing we can do, we can, uh, I can just discard here. I can just come here. Uh, should I download this? Should I download this in CSV and directly, you know, or create a new table like the synthetic and import that thing? It will be much more easier.\n\n38:31 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. And then, um, and then just modify from there.\n\n38:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Yeah. It's easy then because manually entering will take much more time.\n\n38:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. And just let's see CSV.\n\n38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. I just need to drop you.\n\n38:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. It has come here.\n\n39:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nSave.\n\n39:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, the primary key will be the ID, right? And yes, save.\n\n39:21 - Jorge Lewis \nCan I see the, the, the prop, the columns like that? You scroll down a little bit.\n\n39:33 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. We can create, uh, it's adding the column.\n\n39:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThe ID should be you, you ID.\n\n39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOK.\n\n39:44 - Jorge Lewis \nI think it's a little bit too late, but\n\n39:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt has added. OK. We can edit here.\n\n40:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nI think it won't change now.\n\n40:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, that's what I thought.\n\n40:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nCome on, come on, come on.\n\n40:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.

So, so we have this, this loop.\n\n1:33:27 - Jorge Lewis \nI just copied this thing So we don't need this here Okay, so...\n\n1:34:06 - Jorge Lewis \nWhy is that still saying? Oh, expected zero. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Sorry. Okay, this is the...\n\n1:34:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nNo, we can edit this.\n\n1:34:21 - Jorge Lewis \nThis is the new guy. I thought this was the super generate message function.\n\n1:34:29 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo this, uh, this file is different. This is a generate message function. We can just, uh, let the LLM to generate, uh, the question on the behalf of synthetic agent. So, uh, the prompt, the prompt will be different.\n\n1:34:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIs that make sense? Yeah, we just remove this all.\n\n1:35:04 - Jorge Lewis \nCorrect.\n\n1:35:21 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is not a structure of profile. I believe this is a synthetic user.\n\n1:35:36 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah.\n\n1:35:39 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat was the definition of this profile though?\n\n1:35:45 - Jorge Lewis \nOver here. So we can do type, uh, then back here.\n\n1:36:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. It's not profiled. It's it's in. Yeah, there is no S. Correct. And this we have to export over here.\n\n1:36:22 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n1:36:24 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, is this correct over here? System and then, or is this a tuple?\n\n1:36:31 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then I have to do prompts.\n\n1:36:34 - Jorge Lewis \nOr how was it before? Let me just copy this.\n\n1:36:39 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, it's a list. Oh, it's just the two, okay.\n\n1:36:44 - Jorge Lewis \nSo prompts teams, okay, so this is going to change from Like it's just prompt this is not gonna be using So how How should we go about structuring the profile structure? So if you see on my screen We have the prompt is Is it these three?\n\n1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis \nOr well, we're actually. Okay. So let me think.\n\n1:37:28 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this objective is, it can be just prompt. Personality can be part of the prompt and LM. Okay. Okay. So these two are just part of the prompt. So inside of the structure of here of synthetic profile, Should I re-upload the file?\n\n1:37:50 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause I have deleted.\n\n1:37:53 - Hasnain sayyed \nRe-upload the file? Which file?\n\n1:37:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe CSV from the profile. So we will be having the users in the synthetic one. Like, do you want- I think, I think.\n\n1:38:05 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:06 - Jorge Lewis \nGo ahead. Yes.\n\n1:38:09 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, you know what we could do to make it more dynamic and probably better, just a lot better code is within anywhere in the original code that's accessing the profile. So let me, let me go to man to kind of illustrate what I mean. So this function here is returning a profile, right?\n\n1:38:31 - Hasnain sayyed \nRight. Just a second. Yes.\n\n1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.\n\n1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt will be false for the default value\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain sayyed \na way to simulate time to control time based on time interval we can have the chatting with the synthetic like per day or one hour two hour maybe maybe even like per 10 minutes right oh yeah 10 minutes Um...\n\n19:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut over here, every synthetic user will have a different kind of personality, right? Like the few short.\n\n20:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I don't understand that part. I don't, I don't think so. Can you, can you kind of keep going?\n\n20:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. So, so like if admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic users, so each user which is created will have a similar kind of personality or like the talking or the chatting way, like the few shots that we are giving to each synthetic user, like the history or data or each synthetic user will have a different kind of knowledge.\n\n20:43 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, they, they should be mostly the same. So like, um, let me come up a little wireframe here. How do I, So we have, so we can give it name.\n\n21:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nWe can give it personality.\n\n21:14 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can give it goal. It's objective. So this, just a little note.\n\n21:25 - Jorge Lewis \nObjective is a behavior of adapt that the synthetic user is trying to test or exploit. What else?\n\n22:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess the profile information, so just the stuff that's in the super base in the profile table. So every user has, so we need to assign it like things like it's goal.\n\n22:32 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me just check. Ah, I'm going to have to sign in. But you get what I mean. Within the profile information, there's their goal, their Y, weight, height.\n\n22:57 - Jorge Lewis \nBasic onboarding.\n\n22:59 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, like all the information we gather from the onboarding, exactly. So what else?\n\n23:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess it's a list that we can copy from onboarding. So I think with that, there's probably going to be things that pop up that we can't see right now, but I think we might as well get started in this development. There's some things we can start on.\n\n23:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n23:30 - Jorge Lewis \nSo one thing, since we're working on the AI stuff only, for creating synthetics users, we can, since we don't want to work on any of the front end, we can just use directly in super base. We can manually create a table and manual create rows. All right. So I'll hand it off to you. Yeah. So we'll, There's different ways pair programming sessions work. You can do like pilot driver or what is it? Driver. I don't know, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you lead the way and I'm going to kind of chime in here and there.\n\n24:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So, uh, what things should I start with? Like\n\n24:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan we just create the flow like the first we will be working on this, then this, then this, because there are multiple things in this module.\n\n24:38 - Jorge Lewis \nLet's create a very basic system. So what do we need in order to simulate a conversation? What is the requirement?\n\n24:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe first thing is data, of course, because, uh, it is a fake user, first of all. So, uh, the table that you have created, we need that then the prompt, uh, the basic few short, like, uh, the knowledge, uh, on the basis of which the fake user will chat with the agent. So that's the main thing. And, uh, uh, the function functionality, like, uh, to automate this thing, uh, because, uh, the API only hits when, uh, event on click event will trigger. So we have to create a functionality for that. Uh, so that, uh, on each day, 10 minutes.\n\n25:24 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, the, the one where we, because the user we're not, we don't have a real user anymore. We're not sending a message. So we have our AI system and we have the user, but we probably use it more. So we're going to have to replace it with the synthetic user.\n\n25:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, correct. So that's what I'm telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.\n\n25:51 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n25:53 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, keep going. Which one? We're going to have to probably work and make, yeah.\n\n26:04 - Jorge Lewis \nYour voice is breaking. We're going to, we're going to have to work.\n\n26:09 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, it's cause I think\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So with a mission, what we'll do first is have me say off the top of my head, the problem we're trying to solve.\n\n1:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, PO, project owner, will explain how the idea behind the project was conceived, what problem arised that gave him the idea of IntelliO.\n\n1:20 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so the project was conceived because the past two weeks or three weeks I have spent a lot of effort and time into writing, trying to write content, but haven't gotten anywhere.\n\n1:38 - Jorge Lewis \nNumber one, I like writing, I like that aspect, but it just takes too much time to write things on paper or on Notion or whatever, to put things down.\n\n1:51 - Jorge Lewis \nIt takes a lot of mental effort and time to get those onto paper and then into a script or whatever.\n\n1:59 - Jorge Lewis \nSo like I've tried writing content and just hasn't worked out I have time for it, but I just I'm I guess I'm It's too much effort I guess you could say I have better things to do than writing content\n\n2:11 - Biwas bhandari \nor at least yeah But if content yeah sometimes you feel like, okay, I want to write about this, but you cannot start writing in the copy about all the scripts.\n\n2:26 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's a form of writer's block, but also, yeah. Kind of procrastination, but it's like I have better things to do. I'm not I'm gonna save this for later. So procrastination Okay, so with that said let's take just two minutes to notes our interpretation of what I just said and then What the mission is I think you've already done it, but if you want to try again Yeah, I think my one links with your Alright, I've got mine.\n\n3:23 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay, yeah. I finished mine too.\n\n3:26 - Jorge Lewis \nAlright, so Marina, why is yours the same color?\n\n3:30 - Biwas bhandari \nLet me change it.\n\n3:34 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay, thanks.\n\n3:35 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so let's read yours. So the project owner will usually read his out first, I believe. Reduce time and efforts required to write content. So that's what I put. And for yours, the mission of the product is to help make content and brainstorm about it. The problem is, is it takes a lot of time to brainstorm about the content I'm making and the current AI tools congeneration is not it. Okay, that's perfect. Your one's great.\n\n4:03 - Biwas bhandari \nNo, yours one is like my summarized form.\n\n4:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so one thing we noticed in the last one when we did this with Jonas was his was too many things. So...\n\n4:27 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so we'll take your one. Let me copy it. And then what we do is we bring it here, and we get a new note, and we put the mission.\n\n4:41 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd under, the mission. Okay, so we can shorten here. So the mission of the product is to help make content um creation and ideation so ideation is the brainstorm part um faster and or is to make it easier so faster and less mental effort okay because that's that's the problem okay So this part's a good point. The current AI tools for content generation is not good, but I don't think it doesn't belong in the mission. So I'll just bring that over and paste it somewhere here.\n\n5:40 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so the mission of the product is, so we don't have to say this, so help. So, or not help, just make content creation, content creation and ideation, Why is it saying ideation is not a word? I think it is. Yeah, it is. It's the formation of ideas or concepts, but all right then, buddy. Make content creation and ideation easier, faster by requiring... Okay, just by making it faster and require less mental effort. Okay, cool.\n\n6:23 - Jorge Lewis \nNow on to the vision. So P.O.\n\n6:36 - Jorge Lewis \nAfterwards, P.O. And then P.O.\n\n6:43 - Jorge Lewis \nSo P.O. Will give a high level explanation of his idea and vision of the project. Afterwards, I'll invite everyone to write down their motivation behind working on the project.\n\n6:56 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I invite everyone? What do you mean?\n\n7:04 - Jorge Lewis \nI'm just going to tell everyone. All right, everyone, let's do this now.\n\n7:08 - Jorge Lewis \nAfter everyone is done, we'll collaborate, collaboratively compare all\n######################\nOutput:"}}

What about you?\n\n0:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, all good.\n\n0:12 - Hasnain sayyed \nHave you looked at the Figma file that I have created for brain project?\n\n0:18 - Jorge Lewis \nI did, I did, I did. I made some, so I went down a rabbit hole yesterday of just learning some stuff. Can you give me an idea of what's the flow for this ADAPT simulation, what kind of thing we have to work with?\n\n0:50 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, exactly. So, so that's what we'll get into. So we'll kind of today in this, in this hour, I think probably we'll do an hour and a half. We'll kind of figure out what do we, what are the requirements? What do we require the system to accomplish? Um, and then we'll go into kind of making it.\n\n1:03 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So are we creating in Figma or in like the code stuff?\n\n1:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo we'll start with Figma and then we'll go into the code. Okay. It's only a span, maybe 10 minutes in the, in the Figma.\n\n1:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay.\n\n1:17 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can take a quick look at your graph from yesterday. These are all of my thoughts from yesterday. I was just doing a lot of learning.\n\n1:38 - Jorge Lewis \nSo there's gonna be a big issue, which I put a message yesterday, but people didn't understand is that we're doing so much data. So every day, if you look at, I did some math here, every day it's 85,600 words. So that's not too much in terms of like, that's around 430 kilobytes, that's fine. But when you, put that into a vector database, it's about one gigabyte, that many words. And when you put in a knowledge graph, then it scales much, it's much harder to scale. So there's gonna be a big, there's gonna be that issue, it's gonna be too big. Like of course we can use really powerful servers and stuff, but it just can't scale. This is one gigabyte a day over, like for a knowledge graph, since it's more, it's harder, or it's a bigger, data structure, it's going to be much bigger. So like over 10 days, when you connect multiple nodes, like it's just, uh, I think it'll get out of hand. So we need to figure out that.\n\n2:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. Data is the main concern, like how we keep updated and you know, uh, how can we manage that as well? Because the data is changing each and every day. So we have to, yeah.\n\n2:57 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So, so I put a, I put a note here, an idea to have a longterm and a short term system where We have our long-term system that gets updated maybe once a day or once every so often. And then we have a short-term system which is very basic, like just simple rag maybe. The long-term can be a knowledge graph and the new one can be a vector database.\n\n3:20 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, yeah, so I did take a look at yours. Although some of the, I really like this pros and cons list, by the way. I didn't see this until after this morning. I was looking at the graph and then I saw that.\n\n3:34 - Jorge Lewis \nBut for the graph, I didn't totally understand all of the items.\n\n3:38 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah. So let me get you. Will I explain like what's my idea behind?\n\n3:46 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can we can try to do that another time since I would like to do the the adapt evaluation system So after the adapt thing if I still have time then we can do that.\n\n3:54 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay?\n\n3:54 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, cool. Yeah, so let's let's get into so I'll go to Adapt project and I'll make a new design file a new fig gem board Or actually I'll go to the go to the adapt spec page the main one and then make a new page and All right, so I'll make a new page. All right, can you see the new page?\n\n4:40 - Jorge Lewis \nYes, I can.\n\n4:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, simulation, I can see.\n\n4:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what does this need to accomplish? Let's see. So we need it to generate synthetic conversations so that admins can How up to date are you on your DAD projects?\n\n5:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nLike I know the graph working like the check-in the chatting and Onboarding, yeah, the last onboarding I know a little bit.\n\n5:46 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n5:49 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, pretty much same. Okay, so pretty much, do you understand the vision of ADAPT, the goal?\n\n5:58 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, so it's kind of 10 weeks framework. It will ask the goal of the user, like whether he wants\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Oh, wait, it is working, huh?\n\n52:47 - Jorge Lewis \nBut you changed it to value. Try done.

OK.\n\n53:01 - Jorge Lewis \nHow do you read the type? Can you open the type of value or item?\n\n53:15 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNot able to do it. Weird.\n\n53:18 - Jorge Lewis \nTry value.\n\n53:26 - Will Vincent Parrone \nValue extends body cell. Oh, right.\n\n53:30 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, I can see it here. Let me send it to you. Let me send a screenshot.\n\n53:40 - Jorge Lewis \nSo item.\n\n53:44 - Jorge Lewis \nThis is probably just useful to know about the data table structure.\n\n53:49 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so I sense that's the item data structure, and then here's the value data structure.\n\n53:57 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, where did you send it? Discord?\n\n54:00 - Jorge Lewis \nRead.AI tool, sorry. Yeah, Discord.\n\n54:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay. Waiting for... Ah, okay. Read.AI tool, I suppose.\n\n54:13 - Unidentified Speaker \nDang.\n\n54:14 - Jorge Lewis \nJump to present. Click to jump to present, yeah.\n\n54:18 - Jorge Lewis \nSo Jonas just sent a screenshot.\n\n54:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, I saw it either way, it's okay.\n\n54:28 - Will Vincent Parrone \nValue, data body, cell comment, data discovered.\n\n54:33 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's the same data type as a lead. So it is a lead but just it's synonymous with the lead but different.\n\n54:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, so I was correct. I mean, partially correct.\n\n54:49 - Jorge Lewis \nSo you should be able to do item.done. But I think the language server or the type checker, what is it called?\n\n54:57 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIt doesn't like it. Language server.\n\n55:05 - Will Vincent Parrone \nItem. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yep, yep, I can hear you.\n\n55:10 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, is he with us?\n\n55:16 - Jorge Lewis \nWait.\n\n55:17 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, we're not programming session real quick. We're tired of being bothered. I'll get back to you when we're done in like... 30 minutes-ish?\n\n55:30 - Jorge Lewis \nIs he awake?\n\n55:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, he'll reply to you.\n\n55:35 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, yeah, could you deal with that? Maybe try.\n\n55:50 - Will Vincent Parrone \nScrew it, I'll see if it works. I'll refresh.\n\n55:59 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, I see, internal error. Okay, what the hell did I do? What the hell did I do?\n\n56:19 - Jorge Lewis \nTry again, I guess, I don't know, cuz it's a little bit, what even happened?\n\n56:24 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI don't know, is my server getting half plug-in code VSS did?\n\n56:31 - Will Vincent Parrone \nMaybe a stop overflow or something, let me try. Item.done. What the fuck is this?\n\n56:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI'll be right back, I'm gonna use the restroom.\n\n56:49 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYep.\n\n58:39 - Will Vincent Parrone \nso let's see let's see let's see prospect username status discover dot header done what did I do wrong So why didn't item.done work?\n\n59:14 - Will Vincent Parrone \nBoth of them did not work. I tried item.done. I'll try to check.\n\n59:21 - Jorge Lewis \nMaybe casting item.done as a boolean?\n\n59:25 - Unidentified Speaker \nNo.\n\n59:33 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, wait. No.\n\n59:35 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLet me try to smash this first.\n\n59:44 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, get diff. What did I do wrong? What did I change? Okay, the spacings...\n\n59:53 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI changed the spacings. Oh no, this is not gonna help me.\n\n59:58 - Unidentified Speaker \nGod\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over a number of days. So we present to the user saying, hey, you've reached a new milestone. You've walked 1,000 kilometers. That's like walking from France to Italy.\n\n11:56 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, one key aspect of making it very visual, the milestone. So not just, oh, you walked a thousand kilometers, like that doesn't mean anything. But instead of telling them they walked from France to Italy, that's like, oh, wow.\n\n12:07 - Unidentified Speaker \nSo.\n\n12:11 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, yeah, I hope that gives a good idea on the system, so.\n\n12:17 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what the system needs to accomplish is generate synthetic conversations so that admins can use them to improve the system through the prompts and adding reviews. The reviews is just a few-shot prompting. Are you familiar with them?\n\n12:31 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n12:31 - Jorge Lewis \nHave you seen them before?\n\n12:33 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n12:35 - Jorge Lewis \nSo it's just a few-shot prompting.\n\n12:39 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what we need to do, one complication is that we probably don't, well, hmm. Okay, no. So what this is going to entail is we need to create a, what do we call it? A synthetic user.\n\n13:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSo someone needs the ability.\n\n13:11 - Jorge Lewis \nAdmin needs the capability to create new synthetic users.\n\n13:25 - Jorge Lewis \nI got an idea what you are trying to say.\n\n13:26 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo synthetic user is basically a topic based thing, for example, based on different scenarios, the synthetic agent, you know, we can embed the few short and the prompts dynamically to that topic only. And the admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic agents. Is that what you are trying to point?\n\n14:08 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, so I don't think so.\n\n14:10 - Hasnain sayyed \nI mean, you know, the URL for the project Like I just want to know what capabilities the synthetic user will have. Just simple.\n\n14:27 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So the synthetic user is all the synthetic users job or the synthetic user is really just the fake user, right? Does that make sense?\n\n14:37 - Jorge Lewis \nOh yeah. Makes sense.\n\n14:39 - Jorge Lewis \nBut so his old, his end goal for the synthetic user is to pretend to be a user and generates a, a synthetic conversation. So synthetic data. Okay. But there's some things, so for example, I want to, let me share my screen actually.\n\n15:09 - Jorge Lewis \nCan you see?\n\n15:10 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I can see.\n\n15:11 - Jorge Lewis \nDo you know the URL to the app?\n\n15:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nYes.\n\n15:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo let's send you.\n\n15:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nOh, yes, please.\n\n15:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nSend in the chat.\n\n15:43 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. So, so here, wow, that's a lot of users. Um, so here is, is this is like kind of a, just a temporary kind of page for selecting a user where after we use user authentication, will be gone. But what I was thinking is, since these are all users, or actually, no this should probably be in the admin panel. So you see how I have to select profile when I want to modify the prompts.\n\n16:22 - Jorge Lewis \nSo what I'm thinking we do is somewhere on the sidebar, we can have a page called simulation. And in that simulation, we have a button. We can configure the synthetic user. So a synthetic user can have the properties of this. So we can tell it its main objective to test, and then What else? We can just give it some background, like personality. Or give it a user profile. Or goal, maybe.\n\n17:20 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so this is the goal, the main objective. So this can also be, This can be generic.\n\n17:36 - Jorge Lewis \nSo just no goal.\n\n17:41 - Jorge Lewis \nA synthetic user needs the prompt, it needs to understand, or we need to tell it who it is. So it's a user, or you are chatting with a life coach bot, you know, and tell it the thing. So we need to give it, tell it who it is and what.\n\n18:13 - Jorge Lewis \nYou are the person So, uh, hardships might be.\n\n18:32 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, so what we also need to do, which is quite important, is simulating multiple days because the chapel actually uses time.\n\n18:47 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need to make sure that... Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We're going to, we're going to have to work.\n\n26:09 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, it's cause I think, I think there's a bit of a delay, so we keep cutting each other, but we're going to have to work on super base probably to create some manual things.\n\n26:18 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n26:22 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right. So let's open the project. Start your screen share. Do you use this code or VS code?\n\n26:31 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, cool. Can you share a live share link?\n\n26:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, should I open that app project or? Yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\n26:46 - Hasnain sayyed \nJust a second. I just pulled the latest one.\n\n27:03 - Hasnain sayyed \nOn which branch should I pull?\n\n27:13 - Jorge Lewis \nJust a second.\n\n27:18 - Jorge Lewis \nProbably alpha. I don't know.\n\n27:21 - Hasnain sayyed \nJust a second.\n\n28:19 - Hasnain sayyed \nYes.\n\n28:25 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm now in alpha right now.\n\n28:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nDo you mind sharing your screen, by the way?\n\n28:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, yeah, sure.\n\n28:41 - Jorge Lewis \nShow the whole screen so I can see the web server as well as the super-based things you're doing.\n\n29:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo first in the super base thing.\n\n29:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould we create the function to dynamically create this synthetic user or first we should manually interrupt the thing or what else?\n\n29:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo to start off, since that's kind of not the creating a synthetic user is part of what we can do, but I think we should start off with making a synthetic user and then go from there. But, but we have to think, yeah.\n\n30:07 - Jorge Lewis \nSo let's create one in the super base first.\n\n30:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo we have to create a new column for that, right? Because we don't have to merge the real users with the synthetic one.\n\n30:29 - Jorge Lewis \nOr what say?\n\n30:30 - Hasnain sayyed \nThat's what I was thinking as well.\n\n30:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nor just create a column here a new table or a new column right the column will identify like a real user or a synthetic user what say exactly what I was saying but my concern is that this table is\n\n30:49 - Jorge Lewis \nlinked to the chat one the id is linked to if you can see the um no it's linked to the users table that superbase uses for authentication So we can create a new profiles and you try to.\n\n31:12 - Jorge Lewis \nIf you tried to create a new row, it won't work like it because you need the ID needs to be linked to a insert the green button near the top.\n\n31:31 - Jorge Lewis \nthe green insert button above ID. I can draw on your screen, I think, right? No, let me see. I'm trying to see how I can color. Oh, you have it there.\n\n31:51 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, here we go.\n\n32:01 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm, I guess only you can.\n\n32:07 - Jorge Lewis \nBut do you see the insert button? It's green, near the top.\n\n32:17 - Jorge Lewis \nInsert button? Yeah.\n\n32:18 - Jorge Lewis \nA little bit left.\n\n32:21 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n32:22 - Jorge Lewis \nTry to insert row. And you'll see that the ID has a foreign key relation to the users table, which means that unless we create a new user in the users table using super-based authentication, we can't create a new row in this table. So that's going to prevent us from creating synthetic users like we might want to with that.\n\n32:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo like you proposed, I think we're going to have to make a new table. And even if we can later add just a column in the profile table, it takes five minutes, right? So it's better to kind of just start. So let's make a new table. Synthetic user or synthetic profile maybe to keep it the same.\n\n33:21 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I off this RLS, the rule level security because I think it's disabled. Yeah, turn it off, turn it off.\n\n33:33 - Jorge Lewis \nWe don't want to, it'll be, it'll be annoying. It just, the best practice is before you go to production, you want to turn all those on, but\n\n33:41 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm. Correct.\n\n33:45 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.\n\n33:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.\n\n34:05 - Hasnain\n######################\nOutput:"}}

So we have a message.\n\n1:22:11 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, imagine the message history is no messages, so we're going to have the synthetic user generate a message first, and then the AdaptBot will reply to it. We need to wrap all this in a for loop.\n\n1:22:32 - Jorge Lewis \nWhich one? This?\n\n1:22:35 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the synthetic user and the response to that need to be looped if we want to kind of have a conversation.

We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here. So this is their profile information that they set, okay. So this, I guess this can be default as well. We can just set, maybe we pre-fill all of these with the default information and then so that Kuen can make a lot of new users fast. And if he wants to change it, then he can.\n\n48:07 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd maybe, this is just an idea, no clue, temperature.\n\n48:26 - Jorge Lewis \nI'm like that.\n\n48:32 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut yes, we have to create a new column. Yes, for every user for the temperature if you want.\n\n48:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThat will be dynamic for each create.\n\n48:49 - Jorge Lewis \nSo is it is it all good or? Yeah, yeah.\n\n48:58 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, cool. Let's go, let's go into, uh, working on that.\n\n49:04 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it. So which part, uh, should we start the first, uh, the UI, AI work?\n\n49:14 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, so the UI, we'll leave it to a front end. Have you worked with spells?\n\n49:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, no, actually I am proficient in react next. Yeah.\n\n49:34 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, we'll run that for now. We can worry about the backend. All of this here can be done just by creating new, we can set all this data with just doing it in Superbase. So these here, so actually this profile information is sets, this is already from, that's already in the table. This is new, and this is new.\n\n49:58 - Jorge Lewis \nHmm.\n\n49:59 - Jorge Lewis \nRight. I'm sure. Correct.\n\n50:02 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo these are all new ones, but, uh, if you create the temperature, uh, uh, additional point of here, so it will affect the real user or else we have to, uh, set like, uh, if, uh, the condition, like if I did a synthetic user, then it will be, uh, getting from the database or else, uh, the default temperature of all the real user will be like that.\n\n50:27 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, I think so, yeah. So, in the call, in the function that does... I think it's just called run, actually. In that function, we can take in a parameter saying synthetic or not, and then anywhere in the code we can access that variable.\n\n50:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so...\n\n50:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, I'll leave it up to you.\n\n50:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nthe basic thing here if I am just a quick recap the functionality of the backend will be pointing the listing all the you know the user the synthetic user in this dashboard it will be a function a normal select all thing and then While clicking on the new user, it will be picking the default value. I think there doesn't need to be any database. Or we can just have a normal JSON created. We can just create a JSON over here in the, and it will be storing, uh, in our local file only if we want, or maybe in the database. And this data will be, uh, you know, fetching, when the user, when the, and if that, uh, values change, it already been stored in the state like, uh, uh, the input state and if your admin takes on create, the updated value will be creating a new row in the super base.\n\n52:05 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n52:07 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, so the flow of... Okay, so actually let's discuss quickly the flow after I click the create button when I create a new synthetic user. What should happen is that... Let me think actually.\n\n52:26 - Jorge Lewis \nSo instead of 10 because I think that's too long, because imagine this, if Kuen wants to simulate one month of the user interacting with a bot, is too 10 long, that'll be 300 minutes. So obviously if we could, we'd make it instantly. We'd make it, you click create synthetic user and it has one month or 10 months of data, of conversation data done, but the LLMs are too slow, so how do we figure out how do we figure that out based\n\n53:06 - Hasnain sayyed \non data length or based on time interval these are two options I feel but like the number of questions interval Like number of questions asked by the synthetic user, we can also point that as well. Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.\n\n53:31 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?\n\n53:42 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah, right.\n\n53:48 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Like I clicked it's joining collaboration session for quite a while. Okay. But, um, okay. So I'll, I'll just ask you to do it.

It looks like it's just confused. It's the same type of string, but it thinks it's something else. Like we just labeled it as something else. So all we need to do is just use the types that it needs. So we're synthetic here on the right-hand side of the equals is just is saying making it a string. But then we're just typing it as a tables synthetic profile. But for me, it's not giving any errors. But for you, it is. It's just saying it doesn't know what it is.\n\n1:53:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt's also getting error in the profile as well.\n\n1:54:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nI said maybe.\n\n1:54:41 - Jorge Lewis \nCan you push and then save all and push and I'll try to open it locally?

So that's one, one minute for us.\n\n59:25 - Jorge Lewis \nwe multiply it by a multiplier, not divide it. So 20 seconds for us, we multiply it by 100, that's 2,000 for them.\n\n59:44 - Jorge Lewis \nAnyways, all right, let's get into it. So you can open VS Code, share a live share link. So it's 1.30, we've already done an hour. Let's do 30 more minutes if you don't mind. Just so we can get some coding in.\n\n59:55 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, sure.\n\n1:00:24 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, I have sent in the chat.\n\n1:00:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan you access it?\n\n1:00:57 - Jorge Lewis \nTrying now.\n\n1:01:08 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I create a column here that the last time maybe, because that's the starting point to write the function, the last time compared by the current time.\n\n1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry, could you say that again? I was working on the VS code thing.\n\n1:01:37 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so I was telling like, we have to like, as I said, before, we have to add a time variable in the synthetic table, like the last run.\n\n1:01:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, last executed. Oh, yeah. So We can compare the last executed with the current time. And if that is not more than 24 hours, then that synthetic user won't execute. And if it is more than two hours or maybe equal to, then we can execute.\n\n1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, but what I would suggest is we ignore the time controlling first because that will expand the scope a lot and there's so many different edge cases to manage that it'll kind of not allow us to focus on getting something first. So we have this task, we have to make a simulation system. We need this system, we want to, we want to get something done, something that we can see the smallest thing that we can see is going to be one conversation back and forth. We don't need to worry about time. It's just a user having the synthetic user having a conversation with the ball. You can have a stop button so that they don't forever go on.\n\n1:03:03 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then later you can already be excited to see that you can have conversations. And, um, yeah.\n\n1:03:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nGot it.\n\n1:03:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo first thing, what should we start like with the super base creating functions or what else? What do you suggest?\n\n1:03:27 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I'll leave it up to you. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it up to you. You, you can think, okay, we've got a couple of things to do. I'm just picking one. Usually it works pretty well. Just starting. It's hard to find the right answer because they're all OK.\n\n1:03:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause the main thing that is coming to my mind is that function to create.\n\n1:04:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nI'm thinking how to execute that.\n\n1:04:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay, so one thing we can do is and getting this for this. You we have to create a rag over here like the sorry the graph sorry the graph will be similar to this everything will be similar to this folder but that will make the easy and the starting point will be\n\n1:06:14 - Hasnain sayyed \ngraph Okay.\n\n1:06:17 - Hasnain sayyed \nEverything I think will be similar, uh, to this folder itself. Uh, just, uh, this folder is calling the real user. It will, in this folder, we will be calling the synthetic user. And additionally, uh, the top layer will be the edge case that we have talked like the time variable.\n\n1:06:35 - Jorge Lewis \nRight.\n\n1:06:37 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, we, I don't think so. Are you, are you suggesting we just copy and paste the AI folder?\n\n1:06:49 - Hasnain sayyed \nUh, yes. Or I don't like, are you saying that the not copy pasting, like, uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar.\n\n1:07:24 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n1:07:32 - Jorge Lewis \nIn the AI folder, there's one function that's being called somewhere, run. So inside run.\n\n1:07:43 - Jorge Lewis \nThere's one function that's been called run. This is to interact with the chatbot. We're here, we're passing it profile ID, we're passing it user message and user examples prompt. Profile ID is the only thing that's going to be different.\n\n1:08:05 - Jorge Lewis \nSo in, within synthetic user, what we need to do is somehow call this run function, right? Correct.\n\n1:08:11 - Unidentified Speaker \nCorrect.\n\n1:08:13 - Jorge Lewis \nWe, in essence, we need to call the run function.\n\n1:08:16 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo, and the top layer will just be the like, the edge case function that I have talked like one day, one conversation, like one day, one session, the top layer will be that the edge case condition. And we just have to create a loop over here because in this file, it's just a one case scenario, like a one way scenario. It's not a loop where it's just a HTTP request, like pointing, running this function and getting the return for one conversation. But we have to create a loop kind of thing over here.\n\n1:08:54 - Hasnain sayyed \nBased on time.\n\n1:08:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAs we discussed, 30 seconds or 1 minute.\n\n1:09:09 - Jorge Lewis \nAs I said, we have to reduce the scope right now. We want to focus on one thing right now. When you're developing software, if you're worrying about all the 30 different things that have to be made, You're never going to make one thing. Right now, we want to get a conversation happening between the bot and the user. Then we can worry about adding in time into the code. So we need to isolate small things to make.\n\n1:09:35 - Hasnain sayyed \nShould I copy paste this thing over here?\n\n1:09:42 - Jorge Lewis \nThis function? No, no.\n\n1:09:48 - Hasnain sayyed \nI just have to change this thing. The user message will be not the parameter itself. It will be the previous. We will be getting it from the database or the few short.\n\n1:10:07 - Hasnain sayyed \nWhat do you mean, few short?\n\n1:10:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe database, like the prompt that a Q1 is adding from the dashboard.\n\n1:10:18 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe user message will be, in the real use case, will be passed by the real user, right? But in the synthetic user, it doesn't have any, like, the user message from the real user. We have to get it from database, which will be in the scenario of future.\n\n1:10:36 - Jorge Lewis \nFor the synthetic user, we should be using a language model. There should be an agent.\n\n1:10:44 - Hasnain sayyed \nOK.\n\n1:10:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nSo based on the- Yeah.\n\n1:10:55 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause we're trying to pretend this guy's a user. There's no reason not to use a language model. We're trying to create new data, not reuse old data.\n\n1:11:11 - Jorge Lewis \nGot it.\n\n1:11:13 - Jorge Lewis \nI was just saying- So I'm going to try to kind of start you off and see if it makes sense. So we have this run function that's being called by the dev bot. Let's go into the simple dev user. Let's import that function.\n\n1:11:34 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me enable my copilot.\n\n1:11:57 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, my co-pilot subscription ended.\n\n1:12:28 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then here, we know we want to call run. What are the properties?\n\n1:12:41 - Jorge Lewis \nThese are profile ID, so it's a string ID. What else?\n\n1:12:53 - Jorge Lewis \nUser message.\n\n1:12:56 - Jorge Lewis \nSo we need to message to do AI generated message.\n\n1:13:07 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd then use example prompts just do hmm. What does that mean?\n\n1:13:12 - Unidentified Speaker \nOh?\n\n1:13:15 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt's just a boolean template.\n\n1:13:17 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah false okay, so So we have this here const ID is So we need to get this ID from a We need to get this ID from SuperBase.\n\n1:13:39 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, so just right here, maybe.\n\n1:13:48 - Jorge Lewis \nSo for now, let's use a hard-coded ID.

The, what we're trying to do here is, is set this profile to either be from the synthetic profile or the profile list. That's what we were doing up here. So we were trying to set up. We're trying to do this and make it a variable, but instead we're just going to copy this and then paste it here. This profile here will either be from the synthetic profiles or the profiles.\n\n2:09:01 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. Well, I thought it can be.\n\n2:09:18 - Jorge Lewis \nOne thing we need to be careful of that maybe is that if there's any properties of these two that if profiles has something that synthetic profiles doesn't, then there might be an error at some point. I don't think so.\n\n2:09:34 - Hasnain sayyed \nBecause it has copy paste.\n\n2:09:39 - Hasnain sayyed \nIt's the same.

That explains the issues I'm having. Okay.\n\n45:59 - Unidentified Speaker \nOh no.\n\n46:01 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIn my other laptop, I was trying to forcibly justify the leads. I was forcibly trying to justify the done table. Okay.

So I actually thought about this as well. What's the, let's take a look at the front end real quick. And instead of trying, there's an easy way and there's a hard way, I realized. So the left side there is a data table. It's using ChefCN. It's pretty complex compared to the right side, which is straight up just very simple stuff. So I realized if we move the button or the toggle to the right side, it'll make things a lot easier. We don't have to worry about the data table stuff.\n\n47:50 - Jorge Lewis \nBut if you want to learn more about the data table and how it works, I'm more than happy to.\n\n47:58 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, cool.

Basically, I'm going to be copy pasting this.\n\n48:27 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSince this is a boolean one, create render.\n\n48:32 - Will Vincent Parrone \nRelative dates.

It's started, I think. Dang it. Okay.\n\n49:03 - Jorge Lewis \nOn a general note, I wonder if it's a good practice to suffix the files that are cells, like with a dash cell, I wonder. I don't know.\n\n49:12 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI mean, it's for readability purposes. It's always a good thing.\n\n49:20 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLet's call this then. Let's call the done button.

I want to understand and create, okay. All right.\n\n13:24 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, so I'll go ahead and read mine first. A platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the style but also the opinions and experiences, leading to no necessary modifications post-generation.\n\n13:41 - Jorge Lewis \nTo understand and create content through a user's perspective and generate content based on his or her vision.\n\n13:49 - Biwas bhandari \nAnd both of the lines are same. Mine was. After that end, it's the same. I just realized it. Oh yeah.\n\n14:03 - Jorge Lewis \nUser's perspective and vision.\n\n14:07 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n14:09 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this part we've got aligned. We want it to be based on the user's perspective and vision.\n\n14:15 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n14:17 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd I phrase that as style, opinions, and experiences.\n\n14:29 - Biwas bhandari \nSo let's say instead of, uh, instead of, uh, instead of no necessary modifications, I think some, we need to modify it to some content.\n\n14:40 - Jorge Lewis \nBut at the end, the vision of this is that I can just ask it to make something regarding a topic and it can go ahead and make something.\n\n14:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nOh.\n\n14:52 - Jorge Lewis \nor even not even I don't want to like the vision isn't I want to ask it to make content about something I wanted to just make content like on like as if it were me like completely autonomous okay yeah so maybe I can I can so a platform that writes content so we're leaving out to the part where Because the vision shouldn't be the implementation of, oh, I ask it for content and then it makes content. It's just, this is what it, I want it to write content and then we can figure out the rest.\n\n15:27 - Biwas bhandari \nIt's like instead of hiring a content writer, you come to our platform and tell us about your perspective and what content you want to make.\n\n15:38 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd that's the hard part, getting your, the user's perspective to this chatbot, like very well, like done.\n\n15:45 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n15:51 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n15:56 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. Wait, there's also, so a platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the styles style, but also the opinions and experiences leading to Okay. How do you think that is that good? Or what do you think?\n\n16:18 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah, it's good. No. But we need to be able to tell it to modify it later. For example, like we if we if you are a content, if you are a content writer, you will say, Okay, I don't like this part, please modify it or something.\n\n16:37 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the end goal is I can just, it just posts content, it writes and posts content for me, I guess, is the end goal, the vision. So a platform that writes or...\n\n16:52 - Jorge Lewis \nThat I'm going to say creates content and creates what can mean what writes publish and all of the above. The creates.\n\n17:03 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah. Does it align with the mission in the mission? We says make content creation and ideas and fast. Oh yeah. There's creation to creation.\n\n17:16 - Jorge Lewis \nSo creation, I guess, is both writing the content.\n\n17:21 - Jorge Lewis \nand everything between publishing it. And we're using the word content here, but we know that since we've kind of already briefed ourselves on what this is, at first it'll start with just text content since it's easiest. And that's where we get into it in the roadmap afterwards. So let's just stay on track. So it writes the content as if it were me without necessary modifications, without, okay. And these things will change, by the way, over time, if I'm not mistaken. Like as we go, we can read this every week and say, oh, we've actually changed the mission, I think. Like, I'm just guessing. It usually stays the same, but I think the vision might change here and there. It changes more often, but they both change. So now we get into, let's delete this, this, and then copy this. That's the vision. And here's the mission.\n\n18:17 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the product vision board is, okay. So what is, so this is, we can both just fill in at the same time. This is kind of like a group task where we can just each take a part.\n\n18:28 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay.\n\n18:29 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me check. So what is, okay, so let's just vision. What is your purpose in creating the product?\n\n18:38 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n18:47 - Biwas bhandari \nTargeted group, it's...\n\n19:01 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I fill all the tabs? The targeted groups and all that?\n\n19:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry?\n\n19:07 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I fill the other empty tabs?\n\n19:09 - Jorge Lewis\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Well, they're more expensive than this, so.\n\n21:08 - Biwas bhandari \nOh, yeah.\n\n21:13 - Biwas bhandari \nI think that will go into the business school or something like that.\n\n21:24 - Biwas bhandari \nNot so much.\n\n21:33 - Biwas bhandari \nContent creation is time consuming.\n\n21:54 - Biwas bhandari \nHey, darling.\n\n22:07 - Biwas bhandari \nWhat?\n\n22:17 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay.\n\n22:20 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay. I think this is it. Do you need to go to business schools?\n\n22:27 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, yeah, once I, for the target group, one idea I have is that since, so in general with SAS and I hope whoever's watching this doesn't get bored by this, but, um, SAS there's two aspects of, of SAS. That's really hard making it and making a good product and then selling it. Selling it requires distribution, which is probably the hardest part, getting it to people that need it. For us, our means of distribution for this would be Okay, so the reason why we're advantaged at making a good product on that side is because this is going to serve me. I know I'm the customer of this, so I'll understand my own problems. And then to distribute it, I'll be able to use my network of people that are also, like one example is I could use my network for people that are also trying to start content writing for whatever they're doing. Because I know quite a lot of people instead of people, a lot of entrepreneurs and business owners that are getting into content writing, but they're struggling with kind of doing it and their own business. But because everyone right now understands the value of content writing and how important it is to build the brand and all that.\n\n23:45 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n23:47 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, and then, yeah, for this also to help the selling part is since I understand the problems, I can present this better to potential users since I, I can use my own pains.\n\n23:58 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n24:02 - Jorge Lewis \nSo maybe, I think I can rephrase it to business or entrepreneurs, I think, because that's the term they use on all their social media and stuff. So entrepreneurs trying to, or that do content creation.\n\n24:26 - Jorge Lewis \nThey either do it or they're trying to, no, because if they, One thing to think about is if we, well, I was going to write entrepreneurs that are trying to get into content creation, but that's not really a market because those people that have it, that are trying to get into it, I don't think they're going to understand the value this brings. Like, I don't know if that's, maybe, maybe I'm wrong, but I think starting with people that are already making content and saying, Hey, we can save you this many hours is a much better sell than, Hey, we could save you this many hours instead of we will save you if you buy this.\n\n25:01 - Biwas bhandari \nYes, someone who is getting into the content creation will come back later after he knows that, oh, it's so much of hassle to brainstorm about it.\n\n25:11 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So, and then, okay, who are the target customers and users? Business owners with no prior knowledge in content creation, but wants to write content for his or her business. That's interesting, yeah?\n\n25:25 - Biwas bhandari \nSo, yeah.\n\n25:27 - Jorge Lewis \nThat's very interesting because... There's so many people that this could target. It's a matter of picking. The reason I'm picking entrepreneurs is because it's my network. But my network also includes my dad. And he has a lot of friends that are also running a business.\n\n25:47 - Jorge Lewis \nThey could have a lot of improvements if they start content creation. If we're targeting businesses that don't do content creation already, we have two jobs. We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?\n\n26:10 - Biwas bhandari \nI mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?\n\n26:10 - Biwas bhandari \nI mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just come to our platform to create content maybe.\n\n26:23 - Jorge Lewis \nThat's how we would sell them on it.\n\n26:28 - Jorge Lewis \nFor example, if I sold this software to me, I'm already making videos and I'm already doing it. If you tell me, hey, you probably spend 30 hours a week writing content, why not just have conversations with your friends? And use that to create content, save 30 hours and just have normal conversations instead. And I'll be like, damn, that's actually, yeah, okay. Instead, if I sell it to Jonas, where Jonas wants to start a content creation, wants to start writing content, for him, when I come to him, I'm saying, hey, when you start your business, You can, um, or you should start your content creation now because it's so important. I had to convince him of that. Why do I have to convince, why should I convince him when I'm already doing it? Like, I don't want to convince him to start and also buy this instead. I could just, they can already start by themselves and just buy it. So I would, I think I would be a better target customer than Jonas because I've already started. Yeah.\n\n27:28 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n27:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBut later, like this, this has a lot of potential to target like business owners as well. Like we could have a whole sales process of also including that aspect of convincing them to start content creation saying, Hey, content creation has never been easier with this. You should start content creation with our software. That could be a later, that could be our offer later, but right now I think it's better. Make your content creation easier with this.\n\n27:54 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah. Yeah.\n\n27:57 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, Okay, so we're the target customers and users. I'm going to just keep that as one question.\n\n28:11 - Jorge Lewis \nThis thing is going to change so much that it's mostly important so that everyone's always aligned through conversation, I think, rather than having it on paper.\n\n28:22 - Jorge Lewis \nBusinesses use business plans. We, specifically at Startino, use a lean business plan.\n\n28:30 - Jorge Lewis \nThe problem, what you're supposed to do is not use that as a, like that's not supposed to point you to success. That's supposed to point you to the next chapter. The next chapter is determined by whenever things change, like all the time they'll change. You have to update your business plan accordingly or your business model. Um, Because in the same way with this, it has to be updated constantly. But it's just a hassle. I haven't gone into that Google document and updated our business model. But we understand, Jonas and I, the same vision, because we always talk about it. So I think that's more important than actually a document that says it.\n\n29:08 - Jorge Lewis \nHaving it on a document is very important when you're trying to share it with other people, though.\n\n29:16 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's also useful for distilling whatever information you have into very concise forms.\n\n29:46 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat benefit does it provide? What benefit does this product provide? Bro, it's the same... Bro, it's... I'm not gonna... The problem is this. Of course, it's solving the problem. What do you mean... I don't know. Yeah, I'm just lazy. It's only me and you making this and at some point, this is all gonna change, so... How is the product going to benefit the company? What are the business goals? Okay.\n\n30:15 - Jorge Lewis \nBusiness goal is make money, bro. Quote my Brazilian friends. I think the first goal is to, the business goal is to allow me, allow Jorge to produce content.\n\n30:37 - Biwas bhandari \nIt will be launched as a SaaS and also it will help you yourself write content and all that.\n\n30:45 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So first it needs to allow me to write content. Like, cause if I can't use this, why would I, I can't sell it, you know? So that's the goal, the first goal. Um, and at some point it's going to be launched as a SaaS.\n\n31:00 - Jorge Lewis \nas a market leader in content, AI content creation software industry.\n\n31:16 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, we need some, I'd like some fixed, some smart goals. So, something measurable.\n\n31:23 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, to allow Jorge to produce content, You know what's interesting? It's, I don't think it's so weird because my problem with me is not that it's, so the problem is that I'm not writing content because I'm procrastinating. It's not that it's taking me too long. It's that I'm procrastinating it.\n\n31:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo. Maybe this should be making it enjoyable enough or making it frictionless to a point where it's easy enough for me to make content.

I want to understand and create, okay. All right.\n\n13:24 - Jorge Lewis \nAll right, so I'll go ahead and read mine first. A platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the style but also the opinions and experiences, leading to no necessary modifications post-generation.\n\n13:41 - Jorge Lewis \nTo understand and create content through a user's perspective and generate content based on his or her vision.\n\n13:49 - Biwas bhandari \nAnd both of the lines are same. Mine was. After that end, it's the same. I just realized it. Oh yeah.\n\n14:03 - Jorge Lewis \nUser's perspective and vision.\n\n14:07 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n14:09 - Jorge Lewis \nSo this part we've got aligned. We want it to be based on the user's perspective and vision.\n\n14:15 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n14:17 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd I phrase that as style, opinions, and experiences.\n\n14:29 - Biwas bhandari \nSo let's say instead of, uh, instead of, uh, instead of no necessary modifications, I think some, we need to modify it to some content.\n\n14:40 - Jorge Lewis \nBut at the end, the vision of this is that I can just ask it to make something regarding a topic and it can go ahead and make something.\n\n14:49 - Unidentified Speaker \nOh.\n\n14:52 - Jorge Lewis \nor even not even I don't want to like the vision isn't I want to ask it to make content about something I wanted to just make content like on like as if it were me like completely autonomous okay yeah so maybe I can I can so a platform that writes content so we're leaving out to the part where Because the vision shouldn't be the implementation of, oh, I ask it for content and then it makes content. It's just, this is what it, I want it to write content and then we can figure out the rest.\n\n15:27 - Biwas bhandari \nIt's like instead of hiring a content writer, you come to our platform and tell us about your perspective and what content you want to make.\n\n15:38 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd that's the hard part, getting your, the user's perspective to this chatbot, like very well, like done.\n\n15:45 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n15:51 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay.\n\n15:56 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay. Wait, there's also, so a platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the styles style, but also the opinions and experiences leading to Okay. How do you think that is that good? Or what do you think?\n\n16:18 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah, it's good. No. But we need to be able to tell it to modify it later. For example, like we if we if you are a content, if you are a content writer, you will say, Okay, I don't like this part, please modify it or something.\n\n16:37 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the end goal is I can just, it just posts content, it writes and posts content for me, I guess, is the end goal, the vision. So a platform that writes or...\n\n16:52 - Jorge Lewis \nThat I'm going to say creates content and creates what can mean what writes publish and all of the above. The creates.\n\n17:03 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah. Does it align with the mission in the mission? We says make content creation and ideas and fast. Oh yeah. There's creation to creation.\n\n17:16 - Jorge Lewis \nSo creation, I guess, is both writing the content.\n\n17:21 - Jorge Lewis \nand everything between publishing it. And we're using the word content here, but we know that since we've kind of already briefed ourselves on what this is, at first it'll start with just text content since it's easiest. And that's where we get into it in the roadmap afterwards. So let's just stay on track. So it writes the content as if it were me without necessary modifications, without, okay. And these things will change, by the way, over time, if I'm not mistaken. Like as we go, we can read this every week and say, oh, we've actually changed the mission, I think. Like, I'm just guessing. It usually stays the same, but I think the vision might change here and there. It changes more often, but they both change. So now we get into, let's delete this, this, and then copy this. That's the vision. And here's the mission.\n\n18:17 - Jorge Lewis \nSo the product vision board is, okay. So what is, so this is, we can both just fill in at the same time. This is kind of like a group task where we can just each take a part.\n\n18:28 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay.\n\n18:29 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me check. So what is, okay, so let's just vision. What is your purpose in creating the product?\n\n18:38 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n18:47 - Biwas bhandari \nTargeted group, it's...\n\n19:01 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I fill all the tabs? The targeted groups and all that?\n\n19:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry?\n\n19:07 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I fill the other empty tabs?\n\n19:09 - Jorge Lewis\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?\n\n26:10 - Biwas bhandari \nI mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just come to our platform to create content maybe.\n\n26:23 - Jorge Lewis \nThat's how we would sell them on it.\n\n26:28 - Jorge Lewis \nFor example, if I sold this software to me, I'm already making videos and I'm already doing it. If you tell me, hey, you probably spend 30 hours a week writing content, why not just have conversations with your friends? And use that to create content, save 30 hours and just have normal conversations instead. And I'll be like, damn, that's actually, yeah, okay. Instead, if I sell it to Jonas, where Jonas wants to start a content creation, wants to start writing content, for him, when I come to him, I'm saying, hey, when you start your business, You can, um, or you should start your content creation now because it's so important. I had to convince him of that. Why do I have to convince, why should I convince him when I'm already doing it? Like, I don't want to convince him to start and also buy this instead. I could just, they can already start by themselves and just buy it. So I would, I think I would be a better target customer than Jonas because I've already started. Yeah.\n\n27:28 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n27:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBut later, like this, this has a lot of potential to target like business owners as well. Like we could have a whole sales process of also including that aspect of convincing them to start content creation saying, Hey, content creation has never been easier with this. You should start content creation with our software. That could be a later, that could be our offer later, but right now I think it's better. Make your content creation easier with this.\n\n27:54 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah. Yeah.\n\n27:57 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, Okay, so we're the target customers and users. I'm going to just keep that as one question.\n\n28:11 - Jorge Lewis \nThis thing is going to change so much that it's mostly important so that everyone's always aligned through conversation, I think, rather than having it on paper.\n\n28:22 - Jorge Lewis \nBusinesses use business plans. We, specifically at Startino, use a lean business plan.\n\n28:30 - Jorge Lewis \nThe problem, what you're supposed to do is not use that as a, like that's not supposed to point you to success. That's supposed to point you to the next chapter. The next chapter is determined by whenever things change, like all the time they'll change. You have to update your business plan accordingly or your business model. Um, Because in the same way with this, it has to be updated constantly. But it's just a hassle. I haven't gone into that Google document and updated our business model. But we understand, Jonas and I, the same vision, because we always talk about it. So I think that's more important than actually a document that says it.\n\n29:08 - Jorge Lewis \nHaving it on a document is very important when you're trying to share it with other people, though.\n\n29:16 - Jorge Lewis \nIt's also useful for distilling whatever information you have into very concise forms.\n\n29:46 - Jorge Lewis \nWhat benefit does it provide? What benefit does this product provide? Bro, it's the same... Bro, it's... I'm not gonna... The problem is this. Of course, it's solving the problem. What do you mean... I don't know. Yeah, I'm just lazy. It's only me and you making this and at some point, this is all gonna change, so... How is the product going to benefit the company? What are the business goals? Okay.\n\n30:15 - Jorge Lewis \nBusiness goal is make money, bro. Quote my Brazilian friends. I think the first goal is to, the business goal is to allow me, allow Jorge to produce content.\n\n30:37 - Biwas bhandari \nIt will be launched as a SaaS and also it will help you yourself write content and all that.\n\n30:45 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So first it needs to allow me to write content. Like, cause if I can't use this, why would I, I can't sell it, you know? So that's the goal, the first goal. Um, and at some point it's going to be launched as a SaaS.\n\n31:00 - Jorge Lewis \nas a market leader in content, AI content creation software industry.\n\n31:16 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, we need some, I'd like some fixed, some smart goals. So, something measurable.\n\n31:23 - Jorge Lewis \nSo, to allow Jorge to produce content, You know what's interesting? It's, I don't think it's so weird because my problem with me is not that it's, so the problem is that I'm not writing content because I'm procrastinating. It's not that it's taking me too long. It's that I'm procrastinating it.\n\n31:54 - Jorge Lewis \nSo. Maybe this should be making it enjoyable enough or making it frictionless to a point where it's easy enough for me to make content. I don't\n######################\nOutput:"}}

What is your purpose in creating the product?\n\n18:38 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n18:47 - Biwas bhandari \nTargeted group, it's...\n\n19:01 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I fill all the tabs? The targeted groups and all that?\n\n19:06 - Jorge Lewis \nSorry?\n\n19:07 - Biwas bhandari \nCan I fill the other empty tabs?\n\n19:09 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. At the end we can just refute to make sure we're all aligned.\n\n19:14 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n19:15 - Biwas bhandari \nTargeted groups.\n\n19:48 - Biwas bhandari \nNow what problem does the paradox solve?\n\n20:49 - Biwas bhandari \nI mean, are content writers expensive to hire or something?\n\n20:56 - Biwas bhandari \nDepends.\n\n21:00 - Biwas bhandari \nIt depends, I think.\n\n21:02 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. Well, they're more expensive than this, so.\n\n21:08 - Biwas bhandari \nOh, yeah.\n\n21:13 - Biwas bhandari \nI think that will go into the business school or something like that.\n\n21:24 - Biwas bhandari \nNot so much.\n\n21:33 - Biwas bhandari \nContent creation is time consuming.\n\n21:54 - Biwas bhandari \nHey, darling.\n\n22:07 - Biwas bhandari \nWhat?\n\n22:17 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay.\n\n22:20 - Biwas bhandari \nOkay. I think this is it. Do you need to go to business schools?\n\n22:27 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, yeah, once I, for the target group, one idea I have is that since, so in general with SAS and I hope whoever's watching this doesn't get bored by this, but, um, SAS there's two aspects of, of SAS. That's really hard making it and making a good product and then selling it. Selling it requires distribution, which is probably the hardest part, getting it to people that need it. For us, our means of distribution for this would be Okay, so the reason why we're advantaged at making a good product on that side is because this is going to serve me. I know I'm the customer of this, so I'll understand my own problems. And then to distribute it, I'll be able to use my network of people that are also, like one example is I could use my network for people that are also trying to start content writing for whatever they're doing. Because I know quite a lot of people instead of people, a lot of entrepreneurs and business owners that are getting into content writing, but they're struggling with kind of doing it and their own business. But because everyone right now understands the value of content writing and how important it is to build the brand and all that.\n\n23:45 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n23:47 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, and then, yeah, for this also to help the selling part is since I understand the problems, I can present this better to potential users since I, I can use my own pains.\n\n23:58 - Biwas bhandari \nYeah.\n\n24:02 - Jorge Lewis \nSo maybe, I think I can rephrase it to business or entrepreneurs, I think, because that's the term they use on all their social media and stuff. So entrepreneurs trying to, or that do content creation.\n\n24:26 - Jorge Lewis \nThey either do it or they're trying to, no, because if they, One thing to think about is if we, well, I was going to write entrepreneurs that are trying to get into content creation, but that's not really a market because those people that have it, that are trying to get into it, I don't think they're going to understand the value this brings. Like, I don't know if that's, maybe, maybe I'm wrong, but I think starting with people that are already making content and saying, Hey, we can save you this many hours is a much better sell than, Hey, we could save you this many hours instead of we will save you if you buy this.\n\n25:01 - Biwas bhandari \nYes, someone who is getting into the content creation will come back later after he knows that, oh, it's so much of hassle to brainstorm about it.\n\n25:11 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah. So, and then, okay, who are the target customers and users? Business owners with no prior knowledge in content creation, but wants to write content for his or her business. That's interesting, yeah?\n\n25:25 - Biwas bhandari \nSo, yeah.\n\n25:27 - Jorge Lewis \nThat's very interesting because... There's so many people that this could target. It's a matter of picking. The reason I'm picking entrepreneurs is because it's my network. But my network also includes my dad. And he has a lot of friends that are also running a business.\n\n25:47 - Jorge Lewis \nThey could have a lot of improvements if they start content creation. If we're targeting businesses that don't do content creation already, we have two jobs. We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?\n\n26:10 - Biwas bhandari \nI mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just\n######################\nOutput:"}}
