He\'s like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I\'ve met. It\'s a matter of, oh, don\'t use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.\n\n39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It\'s actually a good compromise.\n\n39:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause in today\'s world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it\'s a good kind of reminder. Oh, but trust me, I felt so cool using NeoVim in the airport. In the airplane, I was like, yeah, the people behind me can see me just using Vim. I bet they use Windows. I bet they use VS Code.\n\n40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat\'s this? Exit your status entry.\n\n40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see the web and px super basic.

Jonas didn\'t set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it\'s like two characters doesn\'t make you more efficient, but it\'s just so funny. I don\'t know. It\'s like the inside the head of a developer.

Because if they just keep chatting, there won\'t be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.\n\n18:58 - Jorge Lewis \nWe need a way to...\n\n19:07 - Hasnain sayyed \na way to simulate time to control time based on time interval we can have the chatting with the synthetic like per day or one hour two hour maybe maybe even like per 10 minutes right oh yeah 10 minutes Um...\n\n19:59 - Hasnain sayyed \nBut over here, every synthetic user will have a different kind of personality, right? Like the few short.\n\n20:08 - Jorge Lewis \nSo I don\'t understand that part. I don\'t, I don\'t think so. Can you, can you kind of keep going?\n\n20:13 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah. So, so like if admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic users, so each user which is created will have a similar kind of personality or like the talking or the chatting way, like the few shots that we are giving to each synthetic user, like the history or data or each synthetic user will have a different kind of knowledge.\n\n20:43 - Jorge Lewis \nUm, they, they should be mostly the same. So like, um, let me come up a little wireframe here. How do I, So we have, so we can give it name.\n\n21:09 - Hasnain sayyed \nWe can give it personality.\n\n21:14 - Jorge Lewis \nWe can give it goal. It\'s objective. So this, just a little note.\n\n21:25 - Jorge Lewis \nObjective is a behavior of adapt that the synthetic user is trying to test or exploit. What else?\n\n22:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess the profile information, so just the stuff that\'s in the super base in the profile table. So every user has, so we need to assign it like things like it\'s goal.\n\n22:32 - Jorge Lewis \nLet me just check. Ah, I\'m going to have to sign in. But you get what I mean. Within the profile information, there\'s their goal, their Y, weight, height.\n\n22:57 - Jorge Lewis \nBasic onboarding.\n\n22:59 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, like all the information we gather from the onboarding, exactly. So what else?\n\n23:06 - Jorge Lewis \nI guess it\'s a list that we can copy from onboarding. So I think with that, there\'s probably going to be things that pop up that we can\'t see right now, but I think we might as well get started in this development. There\'s some things we can start on.\n\n23:25 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah.\n\n23:30 - Jorge Lewis \nSo one thing, since we\'re working on the AI stuff only, for creating synthetics users, we can, since we don\'t want to work on any of the front end, we can just use directly in super base. We can manually create a table and manual create rows. All right. So I\'ll hand it off to you. Yeah. So we\'ll, There\'s different ways pair programming sessions work. You can do like pilot driver or what is it? Driver. I don\'t know, but what I\'m going to do is I\'m going to let you lead the way and I\'m going to kind of chime in here and there.\n\n24:14 - Hasnain sayyed \nOkay. So, uh, what things should I start with? Like\n\n24:22 - Hasnain sayyed \nCan we just create the flow like the first we will be working on this, then this, then this, because there are multiple things in this module.\n\n24:38 - Jorge Lewis \nLet\'s create a very basic system. So what do we need in order to simulate a conversation? What is the requirement?\n\n24:47 - Hasnain sayyed \nThe first thing is data, of course, because, uh, it is a fake user, first of all. So, uh, the table that you have created, we need that then the prompt, uh, the basic few short, like, uh, the knowledge, uh, on the basis of which the fake user will chat with the agent. So that\'s the main thing. And, uh, uh, the function functionality, like, uh, to automate this thing, uh, because, uh, the API only hits when, uh, event on click event will trigger. So we have to create a functionality for that. Uh, so that, uh, on each day, 10 minutes.\n\n25:24 - Jorge Lewis \nThe, the, the one where we, because the user we\'re not, we don\'t have a real user anymore. We\'re not sending a message. So we have our AI system and we have the user, but we probably use it more. So we\'re going to have to replace it with the synthetic user.\n\n25:43 - Hasnain sayyed \nYeah, correct. So that\'s what I\'m telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.\n\n25:51 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n25:53 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, keep going. Which one? We\'re going to have to probably work and make, yeah.\n\n26:04 - Jorge Lewis \nYour voice is breaking. We\'re going to, we\'re going to have to work.\n\n26:09 - Jorge Lewis \nNo, it\'s cause I think\n######################\nOutput:'}

OK.\n\n33:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd one thing I\'ve actually noticed that I\'m not going to make a conclusion yet or an opinion on yet, I think a hypothesis I have is that people use Vim and Linux to be more efficient. But what I\'ve noticed is that it\'s contrary because when I\'m watching people code on Windows and code on Linux, the people that code on Windows are less flashy, they\'re using their mouse, maybe they type a little bit slower, but they\'re more efficient. So it\'s a hypothesis that I have that people that use Linux blindly because it\'s better or it\'s more efficient end up kind of shooting themselves in the foot. It\'s a hypothesis I have.\n\n34:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI think it\'s because the value is so like, like the learning curve is a lot, lot harder than it looks. That\'s why you have to spend literally like two to three years. In order to actually be 1.5 times better than the average dev.\n\n35:06 - Jorge Lewis \nMost people, the best companies in the world don\'t use Linux, they use Windows.\n\n35:13 - Jorge Lewis \nUsing Linux doesn\'t make you a better developer, doesn\'t make you a better engineer. It\'s supposed to make you more efficient but what do engineers need to be more efficient? They don\'t need to type 1.5 times faster, typing isn\'t the problem. CDing into the right repository isn\'t the problem. Using a text-only IDE isn\'t the problem.\n\n35:35 - Will Vincent Parrone \nActually, that\'s something I think that\'s where we would disagree. However, something we could agree on is that if you just follow trends blindly without considering your personal circumstances, you\'re really going to shoot yourself in the foot. And also, what\'s the key? I mean, like, yeah, for some people, VS Code works for them. For some, doing Linux, Vim, and all that stuff works for them, because they\'ve custom made it for their specific circumstances. So it makes perfect sense that they\'re going to be better developers.\n\n36:22 - Jorge Lewis \nBut it\'s interesting. Go on.\n\n36:27 - Will Vincent Parrone \nBasically, I see a lot of people just use Vim, use Linux for the reason that their influencers did it without much research and they\'re having plenty of problems because they did not expect that they\'re going to be making some sacrifices along the way.\n\n36:52 - Jorge Lewis \nThat\'s a good reason. I agree with that. To get good at Linux, you need to dedicate specific time to be good at Linux and Vim and stuff like that. It\'s not something that you learn over time, it\'s something that you need to learn, you need to actually do it. And which most people don\'t do because they have other things to do. For me, I can\'t spend time, me personally, it\'s on a person-to-person basis. I have business calls to get to, I can\'t be saying, sorry, let me SSH into my Google Meet server or something like that.\n\n37:28 - Jorge Lewis \nFor me, it doesn\'t work. For me, I\'m a unique person, but for other unique people, it also doesn\'t work for them. They have to work. If you\'re in school, I would definitely recommend learning Linux because why not? That\'s growth. You don\'t have to end up using it in your career, but learning it is great. Learning things is always great.\n\n37:52 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat did I do here again?

Come on.\n\n44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNow my vim is lagging like crazy.\n\n44:14 - Jorge Lewis \nIt was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn\'t set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it\'s like two characters doesn\'t make you more efficient, but it\'s just so funny. I don\'t know. It\'s like the inside the head of a developer. We\'re going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we\'re satisfied.\n\n44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, that is us.\n\n44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, okay.

OK.\n\n33:58 - Jorge Lewis \nAnd one thing I\'ve actually noticed that I\'m not going to make a conclusion yet or an opinion on yet, I think a hypothesis I have is that people use Vim and Linux to be more efficient. But what I\'ve noticed is that it\'s contrary because when I\'m watching people code on Windows and code on Linux, the people that code on Windows are less flashy, they\'re using their mouse, maybe they type a little bit slower, but they\'re more efficient. So it\'s a hypothesis that I have that people that use Linux blindly because it\'s better or it\'s more efficient end up kind of shooting themselves in the foot. It\'s a hypothesis I have.\n\n34:42 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI think it\'s because the value is so like, like the learning curve is a lot, lot harder than it looks. That\'s why you have to spend literally like two to three years. In order to actually be 1.5 times better than the average dev.\n\n35:06 - Jorge Lewis \nMost people, the best companies in the world don\'t use Linux, they use Windows.\n\n35:13 - Jorge Lewis \nUsing Linux doesn\'t make you a better developer, doesn\'t make you a better engineer. It\'s supposed to make you more efficient but what do engineers need to be more efficient? They don\'t need to type 1.5 times faster, typing isn\'t the problem. CDing into the right repository isn\'t the problem. Using a text-only IDE isn\'t the problem.\n\n35:35 - Will Vincent Parrone \nActually, that\'s something I think that\'s where we would disagree. However, something we could agree on is that if you just follow trends blindly without considering your personal circumstances, you\'re really going to shoot yourself in the foot. And also, what\'s the key? I mean, like, yeah, for some people, VS Code works for them. For some, doing Linux, Vim, and all that stuff works for them, because they\'ve custom made it for their specific circumstances. So it makes perfect sense that they\'re going to be better developers.\n\n36:22 - Jorge Lewis \nBut it\'s interesting. Go on.\n\n36:27 - Will Vincent Parrone \nBasically, I see a lot of people just use Vim, use Linux for the reason that their influencers did it without much research and they\'re having plenty of problems because they did not expect that they\'re going to be making some sacrifices along the way.\n\n36:52 - Jorge Lewis \nThat\'s a good reason. I agree with that. To get good at Linux, you need to dedicate specific time to be good at Linux and Vim and stuff like that. It\'s not something that you learn over time, it\'s something that you need to learn, you need to actually do it. And which most people don\'t do because they have other things to do. For me, I can\'t spend time, me personally, it\'s on a person-to-person basis. I have business calls to get to, I can\'t be saying, sorry, let me SSH into my Google Meet server or something like that.\n\n37:28 - Jorge Lewis \nFor me, it doesn\'t work. For me, I\'m a unique person, but for other unique people, it also doesn\'t work for them. They have to work. If you\'re in school, I would definitely recommend learning Linux because why not? That\'s growth. You don\'t have to end up using it in your career, but learning it is great. Learning things is always great.\n\n37:52 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat did I do here again? So basically, we\'re just going to add another column here, right?\n\n38:00 - Jorge Lewis \nYeah, pretty much add a column and then connect it to the database.\n\n38:05 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, I remember, let me just review the super base types again. Oops.\n\n38:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSo where is to do?\n\n38:32 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOne is to one.\n\n38:36 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIs this updated? I don\'t think so.\n\n38:46 - Jorge Lewis \nAlso, sometimes it\'s not a matter of this or that. Sometimes it\'s a matter of this and that. Like, I use a Vim, I use a NeoVim environment in my VS Code.\n\n39:00 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, really?\n\n39:04 - Jorge Lewis \nIt\'s a mentality that my friend told me while I was in Thailand. He\'s like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I\'ve met. It\'s a matter of, oh, don\'t use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why\n######################\nOutput:'}

Jonas is going to continue on the messages thing. I won\'t be on the project right now. I\'ll let you guys work.\n\n46:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nAre you guys both on tomorrow?\n\n46:18 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah, yep.\n\n46:21 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay, cool.\n\n46:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOkay, so I think tomorrow, sometime around midday, we can check in all together and see how things are going and how we can delegate a little bit better.\n\n46:29 - Chinmay Pandya \nAlso, there\'s some issue with the check-in, the database check-in.\n\n46:39 - Biwas bhandari \nWhat\'s wrong with it?\n\n46:41 - Chinmay Pandya \nLike we have three check-ins, an update check-in, a create check-in, and get today\'s check-in, right?\n\n46:54 - Chinmay Pandya \nHello.\n\n46:55 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah. Yeah.\n\n46:56 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo, uh, the code as it was written for create check-in, it will always, it should return the latest inserted node or the data, but it always returns the data as null.\n\n47:18 - Unidentified Speaker \nI see. So is that.\n\n47:21 - Chinmay Pandya \nNo, wait. I\'ll present my screen and show you.\n\n47:34 - Chinmay Pandya \nYeah.\n\n47:35 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo here.\n\n47:37 - Chinmay Pandya \nYou see this?\n\n47:39 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n47:40 - Chinmay Pandya \nThis is always not.\n\n47:44 - Chinmay Pandya \nYeah, so whenever you\'re trying to create a check-in, it will not return you the latest check-in which was created. And that\'s why the data is always null. And in the case of error, we pass in an object where data is null and error. So here, this was the original code.\n\n48:04 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n48:10 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo here we try to return something, but this will always be null. So this, it was causing error here. I think there\'s a problem with this function, this create function, which should be the latest inserted.\n\n48:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nDo you have experience with Superbase?\n\n48:31 - Chinmay Pandya \nI do not have with Superbase. But what I tried to do here is, because it was not inserting, I just ran the code to, for it to insert, then I called the two days check and it will fetch the most recent again.\n\n48:46 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nI\'ll send you, let me send you the documentation for superbase SDK. It\'s very simple. You\'ve worked with Postgres databases before, right? Yeah. Postgres, right?\n\n48:54 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n48:55 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOkay, so you should have no trouble understanding it, and then it\'s just a matter of looking at the documentation reference.\n\n49:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay, yeah.\n\n49:02 - Chinmay Pandya \nAlso when you when you call get today\'s check-in, do you want only one single item to return or Don\'t just send link to one of them.\n\n49:11 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 \nYeah, that\'s the wrong one sends link to super base slash SSR Sorry, I didn\'t get Is it different yeah, it\'s slightly different I\'m talking about like just the basic API calls. Yeah, you were looking at the wrong ones. Like just these ones. Yeah, I just sent a link to one of them. It\'s not SuperBase.js we\'re using, even though that\'s the one that\'s still listed there. They\'re phasing it out and replacing it with SuperBase SSR. But the only difference between SuperBase.js and SuperBase SSR is how you create the client, not how you use the client. So just how a client is created and how authentication is performed is different. But how you make normal API calls, that\'s the same thing.\n\n50:20 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n50:21 - Chinmay Pandya \nBut the goal of the today\'s check-in function is to fetch one check-in or multiple check-ins?\n\n50:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOne check-in. So, so every day there\'s one check-in object. And the idea is that every day the user checks in. So there\'s a new one that created every day for every user. Yeah.\n\n50:42 - Chinmay Pandya \nBecause the current code fetches multiple check-ins.\n\n50:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nNo, I think it does single.\n\n51:05 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo this is the today\'s check-in and it returns an array of anything.\n\n51:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOh yeah, there should be single there.\n\n51:15 - Chinmay Pandya \nYeah, I tried adding single, but since I didn\'t know superface that well. Yeah, no, I\'ll go, I\'ll go.\n\n51:21 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nAsk your boss.\n\n51\n######################\nOutput:'}

He\'s like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I\'ve met. It\'s a matter of, oh, don\'t use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.\n\n39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It\'s actually a good compromise.\n\n39:29 - Jorge Lewis \nBecause in today\'s world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it\'s a good kind of reminder. Oh, but trust me, I felt so cool using NeoVim in the airport. In the airplane, I was like, yeah, the people behind me can see me just using Vim. I bet they use Windows. I bet they use VS Code.\n\n40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat\'s this? Exit your status entry.\n\n40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see the web and px super basic. Yeah, anyways, the problem that I\'m trying to fix is basically when determining whether the types here in the superbase.ts are accurate.\n\n40:32 - Jorge Lewis \nI would update them regardless.\n\n40:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThey should be, but just, yeah, never hurts. Actually, I can do it for you just to double check in case you\'re having too many problems.\n\n41:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI\'ll Shift-C, Alt-Tab, V, superbase.com, continue with GitHub.\n\n41:16 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWell done, now close this window.

I think that\'s one of the biggest arguments.\n\n42:30 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIt\'s basically a personal attack, but it\'s accurate to...\n\n42:37 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLike, fuck you, but like, yeah, that is us.\n\n42:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, the types are updated, so don\'t worry.\n\n42:48 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, let me try to pull.\n\n42:50 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, wait, let me push.

Ah, anyways.\n\n44:03 - Jorge Lewis \nLook at how inefficient you are, you don\'t have a shortcut to nvim, just vi. Come on.\n\n44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNow my vim is lagging like crazy.\n\n44:14 - Jorge Lewis \nIt was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn\'t set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it\'s like two characters doesn\'t make you more efficient, but it\'s just so funny. I don\'t know. It\'s like the inside the head of a developer. We\'re going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we\'re satisfied.\n\n44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, that is us.\n\n44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, okay.

I\'ll let you guys work.\n\n46:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nAre you guys both on tomorrow?\n\n46:18 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah, yep.\n\n46:21 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay, cool.\n\n46:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOkay, so I think tomorrow, sometime around midday, we can check in all together and see how things are going and how we can delegate a little bit better.\n\n46:29 - Chinmay Pandya \nAlso, there\'s some issue with the check-in, the database check-in.\n\n46:39 - Biwas bhandari \nWhat\'s wrong with it?\n\n46:41 - Chinmay Pandya \nLike we have three check-ins, an update check-in, a create check-in, and get today\'s check-in, right?\n\n46:54 - Chinmay Pandya \nHello.\n\n46:55 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah. Yeah.\n\n46:56 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo, uh, the code as it was written for create check-in, it will always, it should return the latest inserted node or the data, but it always returns the data as null.\n\n47:18 - Unidentified Speaker \nI see. So is that.\n\n47:21 - Chinmay Pandya \nNo, wait. I\'ll present my screen and show you.\n\n47:34 - Chinmay Pandya \nYeah.\n\n47:35 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo here.\n\n47:37 - Chinmay Pandya \nYou see this?\n\n47:39 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n47:40 - Chinmay Pandya \nThis is always not.\n\n47:44 - Chinmay Pandya \nYeah, so whenever you\'re trying to create a check-in, it will not return you the latest check-in which was created. And that\'s why the data is always null. And in the case of error, we pass in an object where data is null and error. So here, this was the original code.\n\n48:04 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n48:10 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo here we try to return something, but this will always be null. So this, it was causing error here. I think there\'s a problem with this function, this create function, which should be the latest inserted.\n\n48:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nDo you have experience with Superbase?\n\n48:31 - Chinmay Pandya \nI do not have with Superbase. But what I tried to do here is, because it was not inserting, I just ran the code to, for it to insert, then I called the two days check and it will fetch the most recent again.\n\n48:46 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nI\'ll send you, let me send you the documentation for superbase SDK. It\'s very simple. You\'ve worked with Postgres databases before, right? Yeah. Postgres, right?\n\n48:54 - Unidentified Speaker \nYeah.\n\n48:55 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOkay, so you should have no trouble understanding it, and then it\'s just a matter of looking at the documentation reference.\n\n49:01 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay, yeah.\n\n49:02 - Chinmay Pandya \nAlso when you when you call get today\'s check-in, do you want only one single item to return or Don\'t just send link to one of them.\n\n49:11 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 \nYeah, that\'s the wrong one sends link to super base slash SSR Sorry, I didn\'t get Is it different yeah, it\'s slightly different I\'m talking about like just the basic API calls. Yeah, you were looking at the wrong ones. Like just these ones. Yeah, I just sent a link to one of them. It\'s not SuperBase.js we\'re using, even though that\'s the one that\'s still listed there. They\'re phasing it out and replacing it with SuperBase SSR. But the only difference between SuperBase.js and SuperBase SSR is how you create the client, not how you use the client. So just how a client is created and how authentication is performed is different. But how you make normal API calls, that\'s the same thing.\n\n50:20 - Unidentified Speaker \nOkay.\n\n50:21 - Chinmay Pandya \nBut the goal of the today\'s check-in function is to fetch one check-in or multiple check-ins?\n\n50:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOne check-in. So, so every day there\'s one check-in object. And the idea is that every day the user checks in. So there\'s a new one that created every day for every user. Yeah.\n\n50:42 - Chinmay Pandya \nBecause the current code fetches multiple check-ins.\n\n50:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nNo, I think it does single.\n\n51:05 - Chinmay Pandya \nSo this is the today\'s check-in and it returns an array of anything.\n\n51:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nOh yeah, there should be single there.\n\n51:15 - Chinmay Pandya \nYeah, I tried adding single, but since I didn\'t know superface that well. Yeah, no, I\'ll go, I\'ll go.\n\n51:21 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 \nAsk your boss.\n\n51\n######################\nOutput:'}

I bet they use VS Code.\n\n40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat\'s this? Exit your status entry.\n\n40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWait, let me see the web and px super basic. Yeah, anyways, the problem that I\'m trying to fix is basically when determining whether the types here in the superbase.ts are accurate.\n\n40:32 - Jorge Lewis \nI would update them regardless.\n\n40:38 - Jorge Lewis \nThey should be, but just, yeah, never hurts. Actually, I can do it for you just to double check in case you\'re having too many problems.\n\n41:03 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI\'ll Shift-C, Alt-Tab, V, superbase.com, continue with GitHub.\n\n41:16 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWell done, now close this window. And then...\n\n41:26 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWe copy, exit, and then...\n\n41:33 - Will Vincent Parrone \nSo we go bash, update superbase tags.\n\n41:38 - Will Vincent Parrone \nHmm. Plus x.\n\n42:00 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThere we go. Packages.\n\n42:09 - Jorge Lewis \nLike one thing also that I\'ve noticed, I\'m not here to attack Linux users, I like Linux, I do. But one thing that I\'ve noticed is that for people using Vim and Linux, you\'re often fixing your operating system and your tools rather than developing. I think that\'s one of the biggest arguments.\n\n42:30 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIt\'s basically a personal attack, but it\'s accurate to...\n\n42:37 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLike, fuck you, but like, yeah, that is us.\n\n42:44 - Jorge Lewis \nOkay, the types are updated, so don\'t worry.\n\n42:48 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOkay, let me try to pull.\n\n42:50 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, actually, wait, let me push. I have changes here, though.\n\n43:00 - Jorge Lewis \nThere\'s quite a- Bewis is still learning. He\'s using a lot of tri-catches, so... Prepare your eyes. If you don\'t, yeah.\n\n43:10 - Will Vincent Parrone \nOh, don\'t worry, I also use tri-catch. If it works, it works.\n\n43:15 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThat has been my mentality. Wait, let me just...\n\n43:23 - Jorge Lewis \nI hate this saying because it\'s just so cliche, but everything\'s a balance.\n\n43:55 - Will Vincent Parrone \nWhat\'s happening with my... Ah, anyways.\n\n44:03 - Jorge Lewis \nLook at how inefficient you are, you don\'t have a shortcut to nvim, just vi. Come on.\n\n44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone \nNow my vim is lagging like crazy.\n\n44:14 - Jorge Lewis \nIt was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn\'t set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it\'s like two characters doesn\'t make you more efficient, but it\'s just so funny. I don\'t know. It\'s like the inside the head of a developer. We\'re going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we\'re satisfied.\n\n44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYes, that is us.\n\n44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nYeah, okay. I\'m just going to pull if there are any changes. Wow. Okay. This is from Alpha 2.\n\n45:08 - Will Vincent Parrone \nLet me see what has changed.\n\n45:14 - Will Vincent Parrone \nI\'m getting a bit dyslexic. Let\'s see. To do. What\'s the name of\n\n45:22 - Jorge Lewis \nI think it\'s done, done.\n\n45:24 - Will Vincent Parrone \nDone. Oh, okay, okay.\n\n45:33 - Jorge Lewis \nOh, wait. Actually, sorry, I think the table that you\'re, like the table that\'s showing on the front end there, that\'s actually the leaps table, not the evaluated submissions table. And I haven\'t added that done to, The leads table. So I\'m going to do that right now. So you\'re going to have to actually...\n\n45:54 - Will Vincent Parrone \nThat explains it. That explains the issues I\'m having. Okay.\n\n45:59 - Unidentified Speaker \nOh no.\n\n46:01 - Will Vincent Parrone \nIn my other laptop, I was trying\n######################\nOutput:'}
