Wed, Aug 7, 2024

0:04 - Jorge Lewis 
So yeah, so let's do the, what do I wanna work on today? The signup stuff?

0:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so wait, let me just finish this up. I'm just gonna be removing this.

0:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so just a rundown on my code. So basically, this is a really simple prototype right now that I'm working on. In the sign-in, what was discussed is that we're going to be using passwordless kind of authentication.

0:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
assume that we're going to be using OTP. So the way I did it is I created basically the status.

0:58 - Jorge Lewis 
But have you discussed? So for each feature, we've kind of concluded that we should be discussing with the client for each small feature to make sure all these small things are clarified. Right.

1:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
All right. We discussed this with Q1, I think.

1:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
days ago before we even finished the scope. Basically, what Q1 wants here is that it's going to be passwordless and not done along with the chatbot, like a separate UI for the sign-in.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't want to interrupt the pair programming session, but just so that we make sure we don't work on something that we won't use. There's two sections to the user authentication with Adapt. The first one is the anonymous authentication where there's no required credentials or input from the user. And the second is a sign up page where after they've completed the workshop, they can sign up. Right? So far so good?

2:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep.

2:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And then you're telling me that you guys said you're going to use single SSO for the signup page. Yeah.

2:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah?

2:31 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

2:37 - Jorge Lewis 
But what about, so has he said we, so are we not going to use Google authentication or Facebook authentication or?

2:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually, we haven't discussed this.

2:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Because Superbase gives those to us, and it's surprisingly easy to integrate. I think we should be- Okay, okay. Yeah, wait, I'll- No, no, I gotcha, I gotcha.

3:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, okay.

3:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's, let's, um...

3:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's...

3:11 - Jorge Lewis 
See...

3:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's ask him, then.

3:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So, ask him in AdaptDev at Kuen and say, hey, I'm working on the sign-up thing or the user authentication now. What do you want to include? So, the options are this, this, and this. Make sure to include kind of how the user experience is for each. So, for a Google sign-on, or Google sign up, what that means is that they can sign in, they click, maybe you can send some examples, kind of, you click the Google sign up, sign up with Google, it takes, it opens the pop up of Google and they click their Google account and it's in. Explain that to him, because I don't know, he probably knows, but I think it's good to illustrate with examples. Because like for example, JP probably won't know, so we want to kind of pretend Kuin doesn't know any technical things, but he does.

4:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm messaging him right now.

4:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you done any OAuth authentication with Superbase?

4:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
To be honest, no.

4:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think the authentication that I did was on Firebase.

4:48 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's fine, bro. Don't worry. I don't need know-it-alls. I need fast learn.

4:56 - Jorge Lewis 
OK. And on Firebase, was that single sign-on or was that using Google or?

5:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I did an option wherein I tried Google Authentication, and then what I'm slightly more familiar with is using the email and password to sign in.

5:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello? Sorry?

5:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, me too.

5:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Ok.

5:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I've only done email and password and then I think anonymous as well. There's actually a project we, I've only done email and anonymous as well. We have a project, we have a project, IT, you know, actually, are you aware, like, do you know ITNO?

6:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Artino, I saw it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. When I searched Artino, Artino came up.

6:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Right there?

6:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, hello. My mic is not picking up, but I saw Artino one time, I think, in the messages while searching for something.

6:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I, yeah, yeah.

6:30 - Jorge Lewis

6:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hello, hello. My mic is not picking up, but I saw Artino one time, I think, in the messages while searching for something.

6:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I, yeah, yeah.

6:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Aetino is our AI project we worked on before. It was kind of a multi-agent builder kind of thing and it was actually a great idea. We were on the right track, definitely.

6:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I would like to stop you first. I think I'm hearing Jonas in Gather.

6:48 - Jorge Lewis 
It was just, yeah. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish it. But actually, fortunately, yeah.

6:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Oh, he's here, yeah.

7:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm a me and Google me. You you Alright, alright. I'm back. He's gone.

10:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, alright. Okay, okay. Wait. I'll be... I'll just finish messaging Kuan's sign-in with one-time email. Password userwillsprofile and set the Half of our programming one-on-one is just basically consulting with other people.

15:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Hopefully people stop joining us now.

15:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
You were saying something?

15:35 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no. Go on.

15:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Anyways, so maybe we can put this on hold. I still have one issue that I'm working on, though, related to the anonymous sign-ins that I might need some help with.

15:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Maybe that's something I can do other than the sign-up page while clarifying some things with Q1.

16:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, what would be good is if you send a video, a little short video, Google, for example. You don't have to make one, but just searching online.

16:29 - Jorge Lewis 
So we can see the user flow.

16:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, anyways, sorry. There was some noise out there.

16:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Google search a video on how the user flow works, right? I think it's going to be a bit easier. Yeah.

17:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I'll just search on YouTube right now.

17:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I'm trying to find one as well.

17:37 - Jorge Lewis 
I think I found a good example. Could you also edit your message to mention that we can include multiple of the options.

17:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, thank you. Including this right now, yes, we can have multiple options.

18:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, there we go.

18:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Where did you find this? Just Google Images?

18:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I just searched Google OAuth example. Oh, nice.

18:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think with the exception of Google Auth and Meta Auth, everything's self-explanatory already.

18:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay, so, but what I actually think is we're going to put yourself in his shoes. We ask him, hey, do you want this or this or this or do you want all of them? He's going to say, why would I, why would I not? Yeah, exactly. Why would he not say all of them for him? It costs the same. Um, since for us, like realistically the time to implement more than one should maybe take one or two more hours. Um, which should be a positive, um, ROI for us since the client gets to be really happy and, um, and we can reuse that code. So, sorry, sorry. Not reuse his code. Um, create it from scratch.

19:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Our meetings aren't going to be read by him anyways, it's okay. We can...

19:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Code like this isn't his IP actually, or the client's IP, because it's so generic that it's used in every single SaaS project, so it's not exactly his IP. So we can reuse the code.

19:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think only the workshops might be a little bit... On the gray area of what's good and what's not.

19:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, for sure.

19:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Okay.

20:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
While we're waiting, go on.

20:04 - Jorge Lewis 
We can get into making all the authentication options, I think.

20:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Wait.

20:13 - Jorge Lewis 
If you can share your whole screen and we can, because you're using the documentation on a browser here.

20:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Mm-hmm.

20:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so you can share your whole screen. I can follow along with the docs that you're looking at.

20:29 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

20:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me just clean up my tabs.

20:39 - Will Vincent Parrone

20:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
OK. Let's test this on superbase. Superbase hot documentation.

21:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait.

21:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
If we're going to be including multiple ways to sign in, then here in the architecture, the sign-in page should have multiple pages, right? Like sign-in. There's going to be a sign-in page. And then if, let's say, the user opts for an OTP, well, I'm going to be creating another OTP page.

21:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Let me share with you the code of the other project of Aetina where we did the Google authentication. We did Google and GitHub authentication for that project.

21:56 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, okay.

22:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have access to the Aetina repository?

22:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think I have access already to... Wait, I'm just going to be yanking this.

22:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh yeah, I think I have access to this 13 repositories already. All right, perfect. Let me double check. I might be wrong.

22:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I sent you a link as well if you need it.

22:36 - Jorge Lewis 
And Discord, sorry.

22:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, here we go.

22:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Repositories, Aitino.

22:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go. This is a public? Okay.

22:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, it's public. Do you have access to... Oh, actually, no, you just need to read it, yeah?

23:03 - Jorge Lewis 
So, yeah, I don't know...

23:11 - Jorge Lewis 
My God, stop.

23:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Ah, here we go.

23:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I will data form form that register.

23:34 - Jorge Lewis 
How about this? Um, so it's this, this off, it takes a lot of learning. And I think the pair programming sessions while sometimes you probably do want to do learning together. I think a more efficient, especially since we're just starting off with these sessions, is by actually writing some code. So I think what we can do is we can work on the, remember that to-do toggle, or that done toggle that I told you about on Peres, the Read.AI project? Could we work on that instead?

23:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh yeah, wait, wait, wait.

24:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me pull it then. Repositories.

24:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Read.AI tool.

24:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, are you okay with extending it, like, 15 minutes, given the, you know?

24:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, for sure. I should be able to. I just have a couple meetings with some people, but it should be good, if you want.

24:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

24:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Reddit, tool, tmux, new, s, reddit, tool, tntm, install, And then, no package manage, oh yeah, right, right, cduel.

25:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, wait, are we using, what are we using here?

25:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In order for me to test this app properly, I have to do some CSRF.

25:29 - Will Vincent Parrone

25:46 - Will Vincent Parrone

Huh.

25:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Unexpected token starting dev server. Okay, got it.

26:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then we're gonna do something in Nginx.

26:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Huh.

26:09 - Will Vincent Parrone

26:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

svelte.config.js, delete it.

26:52 - Will Vincent Parrone

26:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then something within the nginx file, sudo vim etc nginx. It's still wrong.

27:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is there no show config? I might have I might have CSRFs.

27:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, check origin.

27:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm basically hosting this in another server, in a Vultr cloud server. That's why I can use it from any device as long as I remember the password.

Which I actually am starting to forget now. What's the name again? Checkorigin.

28:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Check origin. There we go.

28:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And I know this is going to work now because I am a god. So it's available.

28:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Default. Now I have to.

28:38 - Jorge Lewis 
This is Windows, so.

28:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, RIP. I'm prompt. You should be using at least PowerShell.

28:53 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Really?

28:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I prefer using PowerShell, but also WSL works. Like, do you have WSL?

29:04 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually...

29:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I haven't really used it though.

29:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
5, 1, I just got used to 7, ordinary shell commands. 5.

29:31 - Jorge Lewis 
But your vulture is Linux.

29:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Let me try to center my thoughts first. I was really focused on doing the ng-stuff. What was the question again?

29:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Why don't you use WSM?

29:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, right. It's because I keep on forgetting to initialize them, to like start them.

30:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Gotcha.

30:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I don't, I can't imagine working with commando prompts, but I mean, if you're used to it, then it works.

30:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, that's. Actually, that's what's been changing with me recently. My whole mentality is if it works, it works, but I am slightly learning that maybe that's a wrong way of doing things.

30:28 - Jorge Lewis 
It seems like a balance. For me, when I tried switching to NeoVim, or a better example is I tried switching to Linux, to NixOS, but it's more sexy, it's more flashy. It's like, oh, I use Linux, I use NixOS. I use Vim, by the way, but it just doesn't work for me. What works for me is Windows, because of what I do. It's all very dependent on what you do.

30:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That's fair.

31:00 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, I can work so much more efficiently with...

31:06 - Jorge Lewis 
That happens to me all the time as well. I keep opening those random Windows apps.

31:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I also... This is why I'm really gonna change this to... I'm gonna change this to Linux probably tomorrow.

31:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This is a bit...

31:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Annoying to... Yeah, maybe like for most people, for me, I should start on trying new things more often.

31:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's the tough thing. It's like what works, works is great. But then learning to like growing is just trying these new things that make you feel uncomfortable. Like it was super uncomfortable for me to learn NeoVim, but I learned it. I tried it and it just doesn't work. Like now I know at least. So if people say, oh, you should use NeoVim. I can say, oh, I did. Because a lot of things, when people say, oh, use NeoVim, or sorry, use Vim at least, it's just because they heard Providion say it once and twice and ten times, and now they're just robots saying, oh, use Vim. Use Linux.

32:21 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Wait, what's the name of the env file again? This is it, right? The public super base URL.

32:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, are you... Let me send you the new one because... Okay. U.S. Edited it a little bit.

32:41 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I remember. Go ahead. There's just this aspect.

32:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, make sure you pull from Alpha because I've been making some changes. Alright, so I'm saying Google Meets. There's just one more variable.

32:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. I'm in Alpha.

33:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Um...

33:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, public base URL localhost 8080, okay.

33:12 - Jorge Lewis

33:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I think this can work now.

33:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let's see.

33:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, you might need...

33:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm.

33:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Go to app. Oh, now it works.

33:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's see.

33:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's see indeed. OK.

33:58 - Jorge Lewis 
And one thing I've actually noticed that I'm not going to make a conclusion yet or an opinion on yet, I think a hypothesis I have is that people use Vim and Linux to be more efficient. But what I've noticed is that it's contrary because when I'm watching people code on Windows and code on Linux, the people that code on Windows are less flashy, they're using their mouse, maybe they type a little bit slower, but they're more efficient. So it's a hypothesis that I have that people that use Linux blindly because it's better or it's more efficient end up kind of shooting themselves in the foot. It's a hypothesis I have.

34:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it's because the value is so like, like the learning curve is a lot, lot harder than it looks. That's why you have to spend literally like two to three years. In order to actually be 1.5 times better than the average dev.

35:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Most people, the best companies in the world don't use Linux, they use Windows.

35:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Using Linux doesn't make you a better developer, doesn't make you a better engineer. It's supposed to make you more efficient but what do engineers need to be more efficient? They don't need to type 1.5 times faster, typing isn't the problem. CDing into the right repository isn't the problem. Using a text-only IDE isn't the problem.

35:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Actually, that's something I think that's where we would disagree. However, something we could agree on is that if you just follow trends blindly without considering your personal circumstances, you're really going to shoot yourself in the foot. And also, what's the key? I mean, like, yeah, for some people, VS Code works for them. For some, doing Linux, Vim, and all that stuff works for them, because they've custom made it for their specific circumstances. So it makes perfect sense that they're going to be better developers.

36:22 - Jorge Lewis 
But it's interesting. Go on.

36:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Basically, I see a lot of people just use Vim, use Linux for the reason that their influencers did it without much research and they're having plenty of problems because they did not expect that they're going to be making some sacrifices along the way.

36:52 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a good reason. I agree with that. To get good at Linux, you need to dedicate specific time to be good at Linux and Vim and stuff like that. It's not something that you learn over time, it's something that you need to learn, you need to actually do it. And which most people don't do because they have other things to do. For me, I can't spend time, me personally, it's on a person-to-person basis. I have business calls to get to, I can't be saying, sorry, let me SSH into my Google Meet server or something like that.

37:28 - Jorge Lewis 
For me, it doesn't work. For me, I'm a unique person, but for other unique people, it also doesn't work for them. They have to work. If you're in school, I would definitely recommend learning Linux because why not? That's growth. You don't have to end up using it in your career, but learning it is great. Learning things is always great.

37:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What did I do here again? So basically, we're just going to add another column here, right?

38:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, pretty much add a column and then connect it to the database.

38:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, I remember, let me just review the super base types again. Oops.

38:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So where is to do?

38:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
One is to one.

38:36 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Is this updated? I don't think so.

38:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Also, sometimes it's not a matter of this or that. Sometimes it's a matter of this and that. Like, I use a Vim, I use a NeoVim environment in my VS Code.

39:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, really?

39:04 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a mentality that my friend told me while I was in Thailand. He's like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I've met. It's a matter of, oh, don't use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why",19ed1f909ae57e0ac4e8d54d19c03ece,['0939bd111ba4d0c5bc146d16ed11da6f'],1200
5,8a256d8863b619811fe4a5ed726f23a3,", I use a NeoVim environment in my VS Code.

39:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, really?

39:04 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a mentality that my friend told me while I was in Thailand. He's like one of the best engineers along with Jonas and Nazif that I've met. It's a matter of, oh, don't use, well, why would you have to use one or two? Why do you have to use Linux or Windows? Why not use both? Why not use VS Code and Vim? Use both worlds.

39:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's actually a good compromise.

39:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Because in today's world, where the influencers are saying a lot of true things, but people follow them blindly, it's a good kind of reminder. Oh, but trust me, I felt so cool using NeoVim in the airport. In the airplane, I was like, yeah, the people behind me can see me just using Vim. I bet they use Windows. I bet they use VS Code.

40:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's this? Exit your status entry.

40:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me see the web and px super basic. Yeah, anyways, the problem that I'm trying to fix is basically when determining whether the types here in the superbase.ts are accurate.

40:32 - Jorge Lewis 
I would update them regardless.

40:38 - Jorge Lewis 
They should be, but just, yeah, never hurts. Actually, I can do it for you just to double check in case you're having too many problems.

41:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll Shift-C, Alt-Tab, V, superbase.com, continue with GitHub.

41:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Well done, now close this window. And then...

41:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
We copy, exit, and then...

41:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So we go bash, update superbase tags.

41:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm. Plus x.

42:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There we go. Packages.

42:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Like one thing also that I've noticed, I'm not here to attack Linux users, I like Linux, I do. But one thing that I've noticed is that for people using Vim and Linux, you're often fixing your operating system and your tools rather than developing. I think that's one of the biggest arguments.

42:30 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's basically a personal attack, but it's accurate to...

42:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Like, fuck you, but like, yeah, that is us.

42:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, the types are updated, so don't worry.

42:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let me try to pull.

42:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, actually, wait, let me push. I have changes here, though.

43:00 - Jorge Lewis 
There's quite a- Bewis is still learning. He's using a lot of tri-catches, so... Prepare your eyes. If you don't, yeah.

43:10 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, don't worry, I also use tri-catch. If it works, it works.

43:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That has been my mentality. Wait, let me just...

43:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I hate this saying because it's just so cliche, but everything's a balance.

43:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's happening with my... Ah, anyways.

44:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Look at how inefficient you are, you don't have a shortcut to nvim, just vi. Come on.

44:09 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Now my vim is lagging like crazy.

44:14 - Jorge Lewis 
It was a funny topic discussion we had, Jonas, with this Swedish developer that I told you about just now. Jonas didn't set up a shortcut to his neovim command, whereas the Swedish guy puts vi instead of envim. It was just funny because it's like two characters doesn't make you more efficient, but it's just so funny. I don't know. It's like the inside the head of a developer. We're going to spend 10 hours making that shortcut to save no time, but we're satisfied.

44:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, that is us.

44:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, okay. I'm just going to pull if there are any changes. Wow. Okay. This is from Alpha 2.

45:08 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me see what has changed.

45:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm getting a bit dyslexic. Let's see. To do. What's the name of

45:22 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's done, done.

45:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Done. Oh, okay, okay.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait. Actually, sorry, I think the table that you're, like the table that's showing on the front end there, that's actually the leaps table, not the evaluated submissions table. And I haven't added that done to, The leads table. So I'm going to do that right now. So you're going to have to actually...

45:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That explains it. That explains the issues I'm having. Okay.

45:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh no.

46:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In my other laptop, I was trying",8a256d8863b619811fe4a5ed726f23a3,['0939bd111ba4d0c5bc146d16ed11da6f'],1200
6,666cdc98b7574ee6e7ad89209eab1ed0," front end there, that's actually the leaps table, not the evaluated submissions table. And I haven't added that done to, The leads table. So I'm going to do that right now. So you're going to have to actually...

45:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
That explains it. That explains the issues I'm having. Okay.

45:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh no.

46:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In my other laptop, I was trying to forcibly justify the leads. I was forcibly trying to justify the done table. Okay. I'll wait for it.

46:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I've added it Let me do you have the super base generate command a hand or should I do and push?

46:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you do it?

46:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I got it. Thanks. All right All right, I think I sent it or I pushed it Okay.

46:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Space BD.

46:50 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm actually going to paste the command in the project so that we have it at hand.

46:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Leads. We have done. Okay. There we go. Lovely.

47:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think it is in project. No, no, not projects.

47:11 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Resizable panel, data table, lead data, deeds.

47:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So where we want to move the button to, so okay, so actually let's think about this. So I actually thought about this as well. What's the, let's take a look at the front end real quick. And instead of trying, there's an easy way and there's a hard way, I realized. So the left side there is a data table. It's using ChefCN. It's pretty complex compared to the right side, which is straight up just very simple stuff. So I realized if we move the button or the toggle to the right side, it'll make things a lot easier. We don't have to worry about the data table stuff.

47:50 - Jorge Lewis 
But if you want to learn more about the data table and how it works, I'm more than happy to.

47:58 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yes, cool. I already suffered.

48:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I need to learn a bit more about it as well. But the only thing is I haven't had the time to learn it properly.

48:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, me too. Let me try to remember the last thing I did. Okay, here we go. Basically, I'm going to be copy pasting this.

48:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Since this is a boolean one, create render.

48:32 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Relative dates. And I'm going to be Copying this one.

48:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Copy relative date. So let's call this relative to do.

48:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, actually, it's actually already there. It's started, I think. Dang it. Okay.

49:03 - Jorge Lewis 
On a general note, I wonder if it's a good practice to suffix the files that are cells, like with a dash cell, I wonder. I don't know.

49:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I mean, it's for readability purposes. It's always a good thing.

49:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let's call this then. Let's call the done button. Let's see what happens.

49:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Relative.

49:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, see, for... Do you have GitHub Copilot in general, or...?

49:41 - Unidentified Speaker 
Huh?

49:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

49:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you have GitHub Copilot?

49:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No.

49:51 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I am only using a language server here.

50:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
RelativeDateCell... RelativeDateCell... What's the name of this again? DoneButton... ItemValue...

50:18 - Will Vincent Parrone 
What's the, uh... Okay, ID...

50:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Item.ID...

50:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'm not sure if actually this is correct.

50:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I think this is lead.

50:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, what is this?

50:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So I actually tried working on this at some point, but I don't know what happens.

51:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, let's see. What is data body cell? Data body cell.

51:25 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Table color, I know you're rendering an item, so the thing I would have to do is find out what contains the lead.

51:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay.

51:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

51:46 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Nevermind, that's a dead end. Insert columns, table, create columns, status, assessor, status. Property done does not exist.

51:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Data.

51:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So what's item.value?

52:01 - Jorge Lewis 
What is it? What is...

52:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait. Have you... No, you just... I think it's because you haven't... It hasn't updated your types yet, your ID.

51:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Data.

51:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So what's item.value?

52:01 - Jorge Lewis 
What is it? What is...

52:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait. Have you... No, you just... I think it's because you haven't... It hasn't updated your types yet, your ID.

52:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, right, right, right.

52:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Maybe?

52:20 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to...

52:23 - Jorge Lewis 
You know what's funny? That's the most Vim thing I've seen right there. You have to close the entire IDE to get it refreshed. Vim is just like, oh, it broke. Close it and reopen it.

52:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And this is the IT equivalent of, have you tried turning it on and off? Oh, wait, it is working, huh?

52:47 - Jorge Lewis 
But you changed it to value. Try done. I wonder.

52:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Wait.

52:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I have no clue what value.

52:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
There's no error message. OK.

53:01 - Jorge Lewis 
How do you read the type? Can you open the type of value or item?

53:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Not able to do it. Weird.

53:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Try value.

53:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Value extends body cell. Oh, right.

53:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I can see it here. Let me send it to you. Let me send a screenshot.

53:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So item.

53:44 - Jorge Lewis 
This is probably just useful to know about the data table structure.

53:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I sense that's the item data structure, and then here's the value data structure.

53:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, where did you send it? Discord?

54:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Read.AI tool, sorry. Yeah, Discord.

54:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay. Waiting for... Ah, okay. Read.AI tool, I suppose.

54:13 - Unidentified Speaker 
Dang.

54:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Jump to present. Click to jump to present, yeah.

54:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So Jonas just sent a screenshot.

54:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I saw it either way, it's okay.

54:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Value, data body, cell comment, data discovered.

54:33 - Jorge Lewis 
It's the same data type as a lead. So it is a lead but just it's synonymous with the lead but different.

54:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, so I was correct. I mean, partially correct.

54:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So you should be able to do item.done. But I think the language server or the type checker, what is it called?

54:57 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It doesn't like it. Language server.

55:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Item. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yep, yep, I can hear you.

55:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, is he with us?

55:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait.

55:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we're not programming session real quick. We're tired of being bothered. I'll get back to you when we're done in like... 30 minutes-ish?

55:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Is he awake?

55:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, he'll reply to you.

55:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, yeah, could you deal with that? Maybe try.

55:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Screw it, I'll see if it works. I'll refresh.

55:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I see, internal error. Okay, what the hell did I do? What the hell did I do?

56:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Try again, I guess, I don't know, cuz it's a little bit, what even happened?

56:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I don't know, is my server getting half plug-in code VSS did?

56:31 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Maybe a stop overflow or something, let me try. Item.done. What the fuck is this?

56:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll be right back, I'm gonna use the restroom.

56:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep.

58:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
so let's see let's see let's see prospect username status discover dot header done what did I do wrong So why didn't item.done work?

59:14 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Both of them did not work. I tried item.done. I'll try to check.

59:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe casting item.done as a boolean?

59:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

59:33 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, wait. No.

59:35 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let me try to smash this first.

59:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, get diff. What did I do wrong? What did I change? Okay, the spacings...

Okay, restart the server.

1:00:24 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hopefully.

1:00:28 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Of course, why did I not check the console logs first?

1:00:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So it's not.

1:00:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, I believe it's not the table's fault.

1:00:55 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Because the error happened even though...

1:00:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, can I see your error again?

1:01:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait.

1:01:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go.

1:01:16 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I honestly think someone's hacking my phone, right? My AA server right now.

1:01:22 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here you go, transfer with what error?

1:01:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Look at- look at- go down, go down.

1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So, look at, um... Okay, okay. Look, read the error. Transfer failed with one error. Unexpected character. And it's, uh...

1:01:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Let'S see.

1:01:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Superbase TS 1.0. But it's weird because there's nothing wrong there.

1:02:00 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Or maybe there is. I don't know.

1:02:03 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I'm looking at it on my thing. There's not.

1:02:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm with Will right now in a pair programming session. If you don't mind waiting like 15 minutes.

1:02:38 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, fine.

1:02:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, thanks.

1:02:43 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, what's What's my super base looking like then?

1:02:51 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, it's in types. It's in types and then super base. So, yeah, there's nothing wrong with it.

1:02:59 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Hmm. Okay. I'll try to restart it again then.

1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a problem with byte.yes.build.

1:03:12 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Dang.

1:03:17 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, what's htop saying? Is this a Stack Overflow? No, this is not a Stack Overflow problem.

1:03:27 - Will Vincent Parrone 
How are my other sites?

1:03:37 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yep, this is an isolated event.

1:03:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This is beautiful. I love this.

1:03:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:04:05 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Web slash super base.

1:04:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I think I might know what happened.

1:04:39 - Jorge Lewis 
I think... I might have...

1:04:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Say... Huh...

1:04:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just...

1:04:50 - Jorge Lewis 
No...

1:04:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me actually just delete it and bring it back.

1:05:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Because what it looks like is something related to the binary, or at least the file of the types doesn't look too happy.

1:05:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
In which case, maybe a fresh install would work, fresh pnpm install.

1:05:20 - Jorge Lewis 
A fresh PMPM, at least I'm doing the gen types call first, which did not work. So I guess, yeah, fresh PMPM. But what's, what broke it?

1:05:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
It's probably related to the done value. Something screwed the server up with that. Now let's try PMPM model.

1:05:50 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Then let's try it again.

1:06:26 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, I think it's working now. Oh no, it's not.

1:06:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This has gotten a bit more interesting.

1:09:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually?

1:09:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Go on.

1:09:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Huh. It was running a second ago, right? Like...

1:10:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah.

1:10:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. I have an inkling into what it might be. Nope, wasn't it? Yeah, nope.

1:10:17 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it doesn't work on mine either. Wait, what? So it's something to do with this new typefile that CibaBase has given us.

1:10:31 - Jorge Lewis 
That's kind of broken something.

1:10:34 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, at least that's a clue. That's a clue.

1:10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Although it's weirder is that it was working just like a second ago we didn't make any changes on it or we made like a change that I have removed and it's so wait what if we're all back into another

1:11:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
what if you're all back to the previous commit and then just do a git div.

1:11:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Try that.

1:12:07 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, but like, I want a good comparison.

1:12:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
No, the only thing different from the previous commit is the done.

1:12:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

1:12:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
The only thing different from the previous commit is the inclusion of done.

1:12:51 - Jorge Lewis 
But like, I shouldn't do anything.

1:13:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Try deleting it, I guess? Maybe we're like, maybe just, maybe we're just tripping and it's like, just doesn't want to work. It's like, you know, guys.

1:13:15 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me try it. Okay.

1:13:39 - Jorge Lewis 
No, I deleted done and it doesn't work.

1:13:43 - Jorge Lewis 
It's not that, huh?

1:13:45 - Jorge Lewis 
It's not that, it's like, it's just so weird.

1:13:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, maybe I'll do a blind research of which commit is working.

1:14:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But what it looks like, so the error also says, error when evaluating SSR module, the server file for the home page but I ain't got a clue bro all right well into your trusty hands.

1:14:39 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Oh, by the way, do we have the scope already for the Read.AI tool? A what? A scope.

1:14:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Scope?

1:14:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, like inclusion of the to-do, like the backlogs.

1:14:53 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, no. I mean, it's just in my head.

1:14:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:14:57 - Jorge Lewis 
I use this on a daily basis for reaching out to people for sales.

1:15:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, there's quite a few things that I would like, but they're all kind of nice to have. It's not really too important. Okay, okay.

1:15:13 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll try to fix this, if ever, during my date. But it looks like Q1 wants to...

1:15:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think it's more important we go back to work on that. And hopefully, next time we attack this issue on rest, it's gone.

1:15:29 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah. Wait, wait. Before you go, Q1 said that they're going to be signing up for the newsletter before the Y experience, so most likely, the users have an account. They're probably going to transfer the account from the newsletter to us. I'm not sure about this.

1:15:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sorry, say that again?

1:15:52 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll say this. This is what Q1 had said. Remember, in terms of sequence, they could have signed up for the newsletter before the Y experience. And they can call to the mobile app. Try the Y experience and want to sign up. So basically, people from the newsletter would be signing in. Should we do some kind of creating an account if a person came from the newsletter, like the workflow of it?

1:16:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, described, so we're still, I feel like we're still aligned. I feel like he just misinterpreted what we do. So in FigJam, make a user flow of this user process and use these images here. So create a user flow saying, okay, and it's already there online on FigJam. If you open the depth spec, there's actually a section for the user flow, just called discovery. And in that discovery, what you should do is kind of duplicate it. Can you open FigJam?

1:17:01 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Wait, let me see.

1:17:19 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Here we go.

1:17:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So I duplicate the discovery section over here, full user auth flow. In here, search and expand upon it to create the full version with the technical thing. So saying, signs up, replacing that with more in-depth things like how they sign up.

1:17:47 - Will Vincent Parrone 
And then reply to them, yeah.

1:17:49 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sounds like a plan to me then.

1:17:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I think, let them know, say, um, that sounds, that sounds right. Let me make a FigDem to make, to double check.

1:18:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:18:02 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I'll message them on Discord then. Wait, let me message Kuan now to see if I get what you're saying.

1:18:23 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Just to make sure that we're also perfectly aligned, I'll be creating a user on how the sign up experience would look like,

1:18:42 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Sounds like a plan.

1:18:54 - Will Vincent Parrone 
including again.

1:19:00 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep.

1:19:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
This looks good to me. Anything else?

1:19:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me check the message out.

1:19:13 - Jorge Lewis 
So your message, it doesn't feel like, so I mean, he says perfect, but for me, it would be even more clear for sure thing. Like that, It just sounds like all you're saying, it sounds like he said something and then all you said was yes. But what does yes mean? Does it mean yes, that's what we have in mind or yes, I'm going to change my mind? Yes, thanks for the clarification. So when we say sure thing, what do you mean by that?

1:19:44 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I just basically, I'm just basically saying that I understand. I'll keep note of what you've said. That's what I meant by sure thing.

1:20:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But we don't want to be just keeping note. We want to make sure that we can give more than that. So for example, he says, this is what we've discussed. How does that interact with what you guys are planning? It's pointless to say, I understand, just as a first thing.

1:20:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Because there's things that we need to clear up.

1:20:32 - Jorge Lewis 
We can't avoid the conflict of having cleared things up. That's what it feels like, Because there's a conflict which is, we talked about the UX being via the mentor chat with action buttons. Do you understand what he means?

1:20:45 - Will Vincent Parrone 
I think right now, he is talking about the mockups.

1:20:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait.

1:20:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So the answer is no. It doesn't sound like you know what he means. Neither do I. Like, I don't know exactly what he means. So it's, we can't just say yes. We're better off to saying, okay, to make sure that we're aligned. Like don't, because saying it's, um, it's like a false sense of security for him. And it's bad because if he thinks, if it creates an assumption that we understand, and then later down the road, it could bite us in the ass. This one specific example may not be the case, but for things like this, I've definitely seen it happen. I wouldn't be stressing it as much if I didn't see this happen before.

1:21:38 - Jorge Lewis 
If you feel what I'm saying.

1:21:40 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Okay, okay. I hear what you're saying.

1:21:48 - Will Vincent Parrone 
So, what are the improvements that you think I should do, like, It's not on how I voice my messages. I think it's being a bit more inquisitive. Questioning, I suppose.

1:22:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So, of course, it depends on your style then.

1:22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I would like for me, if this were me, I would, I'm going to type it in your, in our person on the end, but don't, don't kind of, I don't want you to kind of take this as a fact, like just for me, how I would do it, right?

1:23:03 - Will Vincent Parrone 
Yeah, basically I'll just try to get the essence of it and figure out the, how I'm going to write it in my own words.

1:23:11 - Jorge Lewis

0:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey there, hi, how are you?

0:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Good, good, good. What about you?

0:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, all good.

0:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Have you looked at the Figma file that I have created for brain project?

0:18 - Jorge Lewis 
I did, I did, I did. I made some, so I went down a rabbit hole yesterday of just learning some stuff. Can you give me an idea of what's the flow for this ADAPT simulation, what kind of thing we have to work with?

0:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. So, so that's what we'll get into. So we'll kind of today in this, in this hour, I think probably we'll do an hour and a half. We'll kind of figure out what do we, what are the requirements? What do we require the system to accomplish? Um, and then we'll go into kind of making it.

1:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. So are we creating in Figma or in like the code stuff?

1:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So we'll start with Figma and then we'll go into the code. Okay. It's only a span, maybe 10 minutes in the, in the Figma.

1:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

1:17 - Jorge Lewis 
We can take a quick look at your graph from yesterday. These are all of my thoughts from yesterday. I was just doing a lot of learning.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's gonna be a big issue, which I put a message yesterday, but people didn't understand is that we're doing so much data. So every day, if you look at, I did some math here, every day it's 85,600 words. So that's not too much in terms of like, that's around 430 kilobytes, that's fine. But when you, put that into a vector database, it's about one gigabyte, that many words. And when you put in a knowledge graph, then it scales much, it's much harder to scale. So there's gonna be a big, there's gonna be that issue, it's gonna be too big. Like of course we can use really powerful servers and stuff, but it just can't scale. This is one gigabyte a day over, like for a knowledge graph, since it's more, it's harder, or it's a bigger, data structure, it's going to be much bigger. So like over 10 days, when you connect multiple nodes, like it's just, uh, I think it'll get out of hand. So we need to figure out that.

2:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Data is the main concern, like how we keep updated and you know, uh, how can we manage that as well? Because the data is changing each and every day. So we have to, yeah.

2:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, so I put a, I put a note here, an idea to have a longterm and a short term system where We have our long-term system that gets updated maybe once a day or once every so often. And then we have a short-term system which is very basic, like just simple rag maybe. The long-term can be a knowledge graph and the new one can be a vector database.

3:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, yeah, so I did take a look at yours. Although some of the, I really like this pros and cons list, by the way. I didn't see this until after this morning. I was looking at the graph and then I saw that.

3:34 - Jorge Lewis 
But for the graph, I didn't totally understand all of the items.

3:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. So let me get you. Will I explain like what's my idea behind?

3:46 - Jorge Lewis 
We can we can try to do that another time since I would like to do the the adapt evaluation system So after the adapt thing if I still have time then we can do that.

3:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay?

3:54 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Yeah, so let's let's get into so I'll go to Adapt project and I'll make a new design file a new fig gem board Or actually I'll go to the go to the adapt spec page the main one and then make a new page and All right, so I'll make a new page. All right, can you see the new page?

4:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I can.

4:43 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, simulation, I can see.

4:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So what does this need to accomplish? Let's see. So we need it to generate synthetic conversations so that admins can How up to date are you on your DAD projects?

5:58 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, so it's kind of 10 weeks framework. It will ask the goal of the user, like whether he wants to lose the weight or what's the motivation he wants within these 10 weeks. And during that, it will get the similar exercises. It will get the data, like the daily check-ins. And based on that, a performance review will be given to the user.

6:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

6:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So that's the main part of the app. Sorry, that's the start of the app.

6:38 - Jorge Lewis 
The main part of the app, though, is after that, where we understand his goal and why he's trying to achieve it, and then we're going to help him do that. Because understanding his goal and helping him understand his goal is good, but now the main point of the app is to help him achieve it. All the features you can see on the page one. We have the reminders and nudges, the daily check-ins, the day-to-day mentoring, and the milestones. So these are the four main systems that are going to be used throughout the core app. So reminders and nudges, okay. Actually, this is a, follow me over.

7:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, here, here. So this is the mentor.

7:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Mentor has three things to do.

7:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold up.

7:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I'll explain it like this. The core app has a mentor. The main agent that the user will be interacting with is the mentor. Sometimes when there's a dip in performance and the mentor gets notified by perhaps an analyst agent saying, hey, the user has been lacking on this. And then the mentor will say, okay, user, do you want to start a coaching session? And that's the coach's job. The coach's job is to go really in detail about why is the user lacking and not making progress towards their goals. What is stopping them? Do they have to update their goal? Do they have to agree on a new system, like some new practices they should do. Anyways, the mentor, his job is just facilitating everyday conversation. One of the main things that you guys were working on before was a daily check-in, right? So this is when you know about the day-to-day mentoring. All this is really is just the Everything other than the daily check-in, I think. It's kind of giving the mentor the ability to help the user and coach the user with simple things. So this will be mostly using data sources related to health, fitness, sleep, all those things so that he can provide advice. So I think this is mostly a very simple chatbot, the mentor. And then he has tools which can make him do a daily check-in.

9:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Although this LMS feature, by the way, so initially Kuhn wanted to have an LMS, a learning management system. He wanted to, it was like kind of pretty separate to this whole app so that the, there's an LMS, the user watches a video every day and the mentor can ask the user, Hey, have you watched the video? Uh, but I don't know where Kuhn is on that right now. I think he's changed his mind a little bit since now this is becoming like a, the term he uses is a, um, is a health vault, I think, or health bank, something like that.

9:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you familiar with the term? He just made it up, but he's been using that word a bit in the chat.

10:01 - Hasnain sayyed 
Which word?

10:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Health bank, I think.

10:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, I haven't heard that.

10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

10:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
But I know this LMS content like it will be recommending video based on the user past history.

10:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Not recommending but just so there's there's one video every day for the user so the user picks a course I think there's gonna be multiple courses and they pick a course every day there's a new video that they have to watch. But I don't know if that's the case anymore. I don't know if Kuon has changed it or how he's been regarding that. We'll have to get updated on that.

10:46 - Jorge Lewis 
The rest of the system, reminders, milestones, these two are just very simple. What the mentor can do is remind the user.

11:01 - Jorge Lewis 
through notifications, saying, for example, hey, your bedtime is in three hours, you shouldn't drink coffee, for example.

11:12 - Jorge Lewis 
And the milestones are pretty much a way to motivate the user. So it's the mentor, when the user checks in, the user says, hey, the mentor can ask during the daily check-in, Have you done your walk today? And the user says, yes, I walked 10 kilometers. And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over",b0786d2e6f6cef97c7622c459b2137a9,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200

And the milestone should be kind of automatic, saying there's just a condition for each milestone. So for example, one milestone can be user walked 1,000 kilometers, for example, over a number of days. So we present to the user saying, hey, you've reached a new milestone. You've walked 1,000 kilometers. That's like walking from France to Italy.

11:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, one key aspect of making it very visual, the milestone. So not just, oh, you walked a thousand kilometers, like that doesn't mean anything. But instead of telling them they walked from France to Italy, that's like, oh, wow.

12:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
So.

12:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah, I hope that gives a good idea on the system, so.

12:17 - Jorge Lewis 
So what the system needs to accomplish is generate synthetic conversations so that admins can use them to improve the system through the prompts and adding reviews. The reviews is just a few-shot prompting. Are you familiar with them?

12:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

12:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you seen them before?

12:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

12:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's just a few-shot prompting.

12:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So what we need to do, one complication is that we probably don't, well, hmm. Okay, no. So what this is going to entail is we need to create a, what do we call it? A synthetic user.

13:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So someone needs the ability.

13:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Admin needs the capability to create new synthetic users.

13:25 - Jorge Lewis 
I got an idea what you are trying to say.

13:26 - Hasnain sayyed 
So synthetic user is basically a topic based thing, for example, based on different scenarios, the synthetic agent, you know, we can embed the few short and the prompts dynamically to that topic only. And the admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic agents. Is that what you are trying to point?

14:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so I don't think so.

14:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
I mean, you know, the URL for the project Like I just want to know what capabilities the synthetic user will have. Just simple.

14:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So the synthetic user is all the synthetic users job or the synthetic user is really just the fake user, right? Does that make sense?

14:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh yeah. Makes sense.

14:39 - Jorge Lewis 
But so his old, his end goal for the synthetic user is to pretend to be a user and generates a, a synthetic conversation. So synthetic data. Okay. But there's some things, so for example, I want to, let me share my screen actually.

15:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you see?

15:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I can see.

15:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you know the URL to the app?

15:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes.

15:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
So let's send you.

15:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, yes, please.

15:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Send in the chat.

15:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So, so here, wow, that's a lot of users. Um, so here is, is this is like kind of a, just a temporary kind of page for selecting a user where after we use user authentication, will be gone. But what I was thinking is, since these are all users, or actually, no this should probably be in the admin panel. So you see how I have to select profile when I want to modify the prompts.

16:22 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I'm thinking we do is somewhere on the sidebar, we can have a page called simulation. And in that simulation, we have a button. We can configure the synthetic user. So a synthetic user can have the properties of this. So we can tell it its main objective to test, and then What else? We can just give it some background, like personality. Or give it a user profile. Or goal, maybe.

17:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so this is the goal, the main objective. So this can also be, This can be generic.

17:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So just no goal.

17:41 - Jorge Lewis 
A synthetic user needs the prompt, it needs to understand, or we need to tell it who it is. So it's a user, or you are chatting with a life coach bot, you know, and tell it the thing. So we need to give it, tell it who it is and what.

18:13 - Jorge Lewis 
You are the person So, uh, hardships might be.

18:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, so what we also need to do, which is quite important, is simulating multiple days because the chapel actually uses time.

18:47 - Jorge Lewis 
We need to make sure that... Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.

18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
We need a way to...

19:07 - Hasnain",858eedcd000ef4713bdaec0ce8240203,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200

18:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, so what we also need to do, which is quite important, is simulating multiple days because the chapel actually uses time.

18:47 - Jorge Lewis 
We need to make sure that... Because if they just keep chatting, there won't be, for example, a new check-in, right? Because check-ins are made on a day.

18:58 - Jorge Lewis 
We need a way to...

19:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
a way to simulate time to control time based on time interval we can have the chatting with the synthetic like per day or one hour two hour maybe maybe even like per 10 minutes right oh yeah 10 minutes Um...

19:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
But over here, every synthetic user will have a different kind of personality, right? Like the few short.

20:08 - Jorge Lewis 
So I don't understand that part. I don't, I don't think so. Can you, can you kind of keep going?

20:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. So, so like if admin has the capability to create multiple synthetic users, so each user which is created will have a similar kind of personality or like the talking or the chatting way, like the few shots that we are giving to each synthetic user, like the history or data or each synthetic user will have a different kind of knowledge.

20:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, they, they should be mostly the same. So like, um, let me come up a little wireframe here. How do I, So we have, so we can give it name.

21:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
We can give it personality.

21:14 - Jorge Lewis 
We can give it goal. It's objective. So this, just a little note.

21:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Objective is a behavior of adapt that the synthetic user is trying to test or exploit. What else?

22:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess the profile information, so just the stuff that's in the super base in the profile table. So every user has, so we need to assign it like things like it's goal.

22:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just check. Ah, I'm going to have to sign in. But you get what I mean. Within the profile information, there's their goal, their Y, weight, height.

22:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Basic onboarding.

22:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like all the information we gather from the onboarding, exactly. So what else?

23:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I guess it's a list that we can copy from onboarding. So I think with that, there's probably going to be things that pop up that we can't see right now, but I think we might as well get started in this development. There's some things we can start on.

23:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

23:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So one thing, since we're working on the AI stuff only, for creating synthetics users, we can, since we don't want to work on any of the front end, we can just use directly in super base. We can manually create a table and manual create rows. All right. So I'll hand it off to you. Yeah. So we'll, There's different ways pair programming sessions work. You can do like pilot driver or what is it? Driver. I don't know, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you lead the way and I'm going to kind of chime in here and there.

24:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. So, uh, what things should I start with? Like

24:22 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can we just create the flow like the first we will be working on this, then this, then this, because there are multiple things in this module.

24:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's create a very basic system. So what do we need in order to simulate a conversation? What is the requirement?

24:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
The first thing is data, of course, because, uh, it is a fake user, first of all. So, uh, the table that you have created, we need that then the prompt, uh, the basic few short, like, uh, the knowledge, uh, on the basis of which the fake user will chat with the agent. So that's the main thing. And, uh, uh, the function functionality, like, uh, to automate this thing, uh, because, uh, the API only hits when, uh, event on click event will trigger. So we have to create a functionality for that. Uh, so that, uh, on each day, 10 minutes.

25:24 - Jorge Lewis 
The, the, the one where we, because the user we're not, we don't have a real user anymore. We're not sending a message. So we have our AI system and we have the user, but we probably use it more. So we're going to have to replace it with the synthetic user.

25:43 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, correct. So that's what I'm telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.

25:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, keep going. Which one? We're going to have to probably work and make, yeah.

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Your voice is breaking. We're going to, we're going to have to work.

26:09 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's cause I think",1437aec87cb0992578b65b1147734e1d,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200
16,5de2e6d436c369fdb5a7089e8a144b89," So that's what I'm telling. We have to create a function. So then we can start with that.

25:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

25:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, keep going. Which one? We're going to have to probably work and make, yeah.

26:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Your voice is breaking. We're going to, we're going to have to work.

26:09 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's cause I think, I think there's a bit of a delay, so we keep cutting each other, but we're going to have to work on super base probably to create some manual things.

26:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

26:22 - Jorge Lewis 
All right. So let's open the project. Start your screen share. Do you use this code or VS code?

26:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, cool. Can you share a live share link?

26:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, should I open that app project or? Yeah, yeah. Okay.

26:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just a second. I just pulled the latest one.

27:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
On which branch should I pull?

27:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Just a second.

27:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Probably alpha. I don't know.

27:21 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just a second.

28:19 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes.

28:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
I'm now in alpha right now.

28:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Do you mind sharing your screen, by the way?

28:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah, sure.

28:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Show the whole screen so I can see the web server as well as the super-based things you're doing.

29:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
So first in the super base thing.

29:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should we create the function to dynamically create this synthetic user or first we should manually interrupt the thing or what else?

29:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So to start off, since that's kind of not the creating a synthetic user is part of what we can do, but I think we should start off with making a synthetic user and then go from there. But, but we have to think, yeah.

30:07 - Jorge Lewis 
So let's create one in the super base first.

30:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
So we have to create a new column for that, right? Because we don't have to merge the real users with the synthetic one.

30:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Or what say?

30:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
That's what I was thinking as well.

30:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
or just create a column here a new table or a new column right the column will identify like a real user or a synthetic user what say exactly what I was saying but my concern is that this table is

30:49 - Jorge Lewis 
linked to the chat one the id is linked to if you can see the um no it's linked to the users table that superbase uses for authentication So we can create a new profiles and you try to.

31:12 - Jorge Lewis 
If you tried to create a new row, it won't work like it because you need the ID needs to be linked to a insert the green button near the top.

31:31 - Jorge Lewis 
the green insert button above ID. I can draw on your screen, I think, right? No, let me see. I'm trying to see how I can color. Oh, you have it there.

31:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, here we go.

32:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm, I guess only you can.

32:07 - Jorge Lewis 
But do you see the insert button? It's green, near the top.

32:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Insert button? Yeah.

32:18 - Jorge Lewis 
A little bit left.

32:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

32:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Try to insert row. And you'll see that the ID has a foreign key relation to the users table, which means that unless we create a new user in the users table using super-based authentication, we can't create a new row in this table. So that's going to prevent us from creating synthetic users like we might want to with that.

32:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So like you proposed, I think we're going to have to make a new table. And even if we can later add just a column in the profile table, it takes five minutes, right? So it's better to kind of just start. So let's make a new table. Synthetic user or synthetic profile maybe to keep it the same.

33:21 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I off this RLS, the rule level security because I think it's disabled. Yeah, turn it off, turn it off.

33:33 - Jorge Lewis 
We don't want to, it'll be, it'll be annoying. It just, the best practice is before you go to production, you want to turn all those on, but

33:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm. Correct.

33:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
So the, attributes will be, ID is already there, created at.

33:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.

34:05 - Hasnain",5de2e6d436c369fdb5a7089e8a144b89,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200

So this is going to be the same as, um, actually we kind of did a little bit. We need the name, personality, or anything.

34:05 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you copy paste over here? It will be fast. Like the name of columns, because it needs to be similar.

34:18 - Jorge Lewis 
The, um, I'm still trying to sign into the super basic account. Um, does super base have like sign in with, uh, Google?

34:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, it has.

34:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's exactly, but I can't see it.

34:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, no, I mean like, it's its own platform.

34:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, so I don't think so.

35:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Or else I can copy paste over here.

35:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Oh, there we go. I'm in. Nice.

35:41 - Hasnain sayyed 
I'm just writing the column attribute. So I just copy paste.

35:51 - Jorge Lewis 
What I want to note on though, what I want to note on is that this synthetic user for example first name and last name hmm they don't need to be separate I think what do you think like or actually

36:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
huh actually no they do yeah I think it needs to be identical to the profile table yeah yeah um Because the functions, uh, if they're going to be using the first name, it's not using, uh, it's needs to be similar because there will be other, uh, the data is null. Okay.

36:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, exactly. So what I've also noticed though, is that the code right now is using, um, is using the profiles table, right? So if we want to make it use the Profiles table or the synthetic user table without having to rewrite all the code Should we use like an if state like should we in the request to call the AI? That we probably need to add a parameter or something like synthetic so that we can add an add a an if operation so like if this is synthetic use the The synthetic table does that make sense?

37:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah, I What I am thinking is, while the first flow, the Q1 created the synthetic user, then we have to create an external function which gets the ability for that agent, the synthetic user, to automatically chat with the agent. So we have to create that function. And the graph will be same, of course. The flow and the graph, the functions will be same. We just have to create a functionality that will automate the synthetic user to pass the message or the prompt or whatever, the query. Automatically, once it has received the agent response, then the user will automatically send That's the main rule over here. Because this is just a data. Sorry, I just clicked on Zoom. Yeah. So this is just, uh, you know, uh, the character or the character building thing. We can say, Oh, one thing we can do, we can, uh, I can just discard here. I can just come here. Uh, should I download this? Should I download this in CSV and directly, you know, or create a new table like the synthetic and import that thing? It will be much more easier.

38:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And then, um, and then just modify from there.

38:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah. It's easy then because manually entering will take much more time.

38:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. And just let's see CSV.

38:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. I just need to drop you.

38:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. It has come here.

39:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Save.

39:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, the primary key will be the ID, right? And yes, save.

39:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Can I see the, the, the prop, the columns like that? You scroll down a little bit.

39:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. We can create, uh, it's adding the column.

39:38 - Jorge Lewis 
The ID should be you, you ID.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's a little bit too late, but

39:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
It has added. OK. We can edit here.

40:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think it won't change now.

40:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, that's what I thought.

40:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
Come on, come on, come on.

40:13 - Hasnain sayyed

40:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

40:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, In case you didn't know, if you click the button, the checkbox button on the same row as the labels, it does all. Yeah, yeah.

40:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
The dark UI, it's hard to find the options.

40:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah, you're on a laptop. Yeah, you're on a laptop.

41:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I have the same problem. When it's nighttime for me and I put my monitor on like a lower brightness, all the dark UI starts to kind of fade in.

41:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Now we can go into the code and start working.

41:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's see what we're missing from this that we might need. We need to tell the agent.

41:35 - Jorge Lewis 
We need to tell the agent, the synthetic profile, who it is or what its objective is. Because like me as a user, I know what I'm doing. So I think we can add a column for prompts. So if you go to the, if you scroll left a little bit.

41:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, yeah, left, left. Yeah, no, the other way, the other way.

42:04 - Jorge Lewis 
More, more. There's a prompts column that I'm looking for.

42:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, it's there.

42:10 - Jorge Lewis 
So here, so this column in a real profile is connected to the admin page. But since this synthetic user is not accessing the admin page, I think we can change it. I think we can change the structure of it.

42:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I wonder if Yeah, I think that should be fine. Let's do that. So in the structure of the...

42:42 - Jorge Lewis 
I'll also share my screen, by the way.

42:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, please, please.

42:48 - Jorge Lewis 
And that way we can just go back and forth.

42:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, yeah. What I'm thinking is...

42:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should we add an option to the admin panel, like, or get a, like, if the flow that we have decided will add a similar kind of user, because we haven't created any option to, you know, change the user character or the few short prompt, whatever. So we can have some options to admin that, like four or five examples, we have to, create that data. And whenever the user clicks on, whenever the admin clicks, like, yeah, I need this character, I need this synthetic user character, maybe like a goal will be different for that synthetic user. Have you got the point?

43:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so you see my screen share.

43:59 - Jorge Lewis 
We have input fields for the prompt We have input fields for the prompt so they They can go in here and modify the prompts in the same way. I think we can modify the prompts of the the characteristics of the the Synthetic guy. So for example, what I can do is I'll I'll kind of, actually let me take a screenshot of this. So what I want is a button here that says synthetic users. Something like this maybe. And when it opens it, let me just kind of make this empty.

44:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so pretend like I've just, there. So here, what I think we can do is have, so I think what we'll have is two tabs. We'll have manage users.

45:24 - Jorge Lewis 
And then we'll have a new user.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So the managed users, what it's going to do is help with being able to remove, or actually just, okay, I have an idea actually. So when you go to, synthetic users, the UI will look like a table with all of the properties. And then we can have a button at the top. Can I move this? A button at the top.

46:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Add new synthetic user. And when you click this, it opens a pop-up.

46:25 - Jorge Lewis 
new pop-up or a model like yeah a model model yeah what do we see and then we have we can give it a new name hmm so pretty much all of it So we get a new name, a new personality, the objective.

47:02 - Jorge Lewis 
This one can be null. So I guess all of them can be null and we can have a default.

47:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it.

47:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So for example, the objective, when it's default, could literally be nothing. We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here",ee650c3349e9c45cb3b7d90948ccf3c8,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200
19,93d369d8234a83de63f768cc17cf8c34,"nain sayyed 
Got it.

47:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So for example, the objective, when it's default, could literally be nothing. We just tell the bot who it is and what it's doing, and we let it, like, kind of just, you know, we tell it, pretend you're a person that's trying to achieve this goal, and you're chatting, you're trying to improve your life with a chatbot, with a life coach here. So this is their profile information that they set, okay. So this, I guess this can be default as well. We can just set, maybe we pre-fill all of these with the default information and then so that Kuen can make a lot of new users fast. And if he wants to change it, then he can.

48:07 - Jorge Lewis 
And maybe, this is just an idea, no clue, temperature.

48:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm like that.

48:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
But yes, we have to create a new column. Yes, for every user for the temperature if you want.

48:42 - Jorge Lewis 
That will be dynamic for each create.

48:49 - Jorge Lewis 
So is it is it all good or? Yeah, yeah.

48:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, cool. Let's go, let's go into, uh, working on that.

49:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it. So which part, uh, should we start the first, uh, the UI, AI work?

49:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so the UI, we'll leave it to a front end. Have you worked with spells?

49:22 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, no, actually I am proficient in react next. Yeah.

49:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, we'll run that for now. We can worry about the backend. All of this here can be done just by creating new, we can set all this data with just doing it in Superbase. So these here, so actually this profile information is sets, this is already from, that's already in the table. This is new, and this is new.

49:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

49:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Right. I'm sure. Correct.

50:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
So these are all new ones, but, uh, if you create the temperature, uh, uh, additional point of here, so it will affect the real user or else we have to, uh, set like, uh, if, uh, the condition, like if I did a synthetic user, then it will be, uh, getting from the database or else, uh, the default temperature of all the real user will be like that.

50:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I think so, yeah. So, in the call, in the function that does... I think it's just called run, actually. In that function, we can take in a parameter saying synthetic or not, and then anywhere in the code we can access that variable.

50:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so...

50:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I'll leave it up to you.

50:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
the basic thing here if I am just a quick recap the functionality of the backend will be pointing the listing all the you know the user the synthetic user in this dashboard it will be a function a normal select all thing and then While clicking on the new user, it will be picking the default value. I think there doesn't need to be any database. Or we can just have a normal JSON created. We can just create a JSON over here in the, and it will be storing, uh, in our local file only if we want, or maybe in the database. And this data will be, uh, you know, fetching, when the user, when the, and if that, uh, values change, it already been stored in the state like, uh, uh, the input state and if your admin takes on create, the updated value will be creating a new row in the super base.

52:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

52:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so the flow of... Okay, so actually let's discuss quickly the flow after I click the create button when I create a new synthetic user. What should happen is that... Let me think actually.

52:26 - Jorge Lewis 
So instead of 10 because I think that's too long, because imagine this, if Kuen wants to simulate one month of the user interacting with a bot, is too 10 long, that'll be 300 minutes. So obviously if we could, we'd make it instantly. We'd make it, you click create synthetic user and it has one month or 10 months of data, of conversation data done, but the LLMs are too slow, so how do we figure out how do we figure that out based

53:06 - Hasnain sayyed 
on data length or based on time interval these are two options I feel but like the number of questions interval Like number of questions asked by the synthetic user, we can also point that as well. Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.

53:31 - Jorge Lewis 
So for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?

53:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, right.

53:48 - Jorge Lewis 
We can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I",93d369d8234a83de63f768cc17cf8c34,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200
20,270fffd7af538ddc9b36416a31b4387d," as well. Like it won't exceed 10 questions, maybe.

53:31 - Jorge Lewis 
So for time interval, I like time interval more, but what's the lowest we can set it at? Because one minute, I don't think they can have enough messages. Maybe?

53:42 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, right.

53:48 - Jorge Lewis 
We can play around with the number. We can set it later. Also, one concern I have that I think will be kind of annoying is, so the synthetic user, how will he or when will he send a message? Because how that will work is, this guy sends a message to this guy, this guy responds immediately, the bot responds immediately. And then the synthetic user, because he's in LLM, will receive the response and respond immediately as well. And it'll keep going. There's no way to say, okay, um, yeah, no, not even waiting for it. Like for example, a normal user, they wake up, they'll open the app, they'll talk, chat with the user, the chatbot and say, Hey, um, hi. They'll have a conversation. The phone, the usual, put the phone down. But in our case, the synthetic user, how do we tell him to put the phone down?

54:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

54:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
One, one, one idea.

54:59 - Jorge Lewis 
One idea is that we separate, um, we give the, the synthetic user, their concept of a, um, of, of a conversation and the synthetic user will know, or we'll have an objective for each conversation. And when it reaches that objective, it closes the conversation and then it, um, it calls a function saying let's time elapse and it lets an hour or two pass fake, fake one hour or two.

55:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, okay. I got it. Um, but I'm thinking like how we create that function, like, uh, while conversation between two points, we have to create a loop kind of thing that this is the basic, uh, brute force approach or else we have to based on we have to create a function like based on the like response from the synthetic user it will it will think like if the synthetic user wants to ask another question like wants to give another answer or not or like it will stop at that point this is the two solutions I can think like the

56:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Is the loop, so I have an idea, but it might be the same as a loop. It's like a brute force, like you said. A conversation is five minutes. So that after five minutes, they stop talking and we let time to pass. Is that what you're suggesting?

56:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, correct, correct.

56:36 - Jorge Lewis 
I think we can do that, yeah.

56:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But like right now, we don't have to worry about that. We can just make it have, We can just let it go back and forth. We don't have to worry. And then later we can worry about controlling the time. How does that sound?

56:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Correct. We can change the time, whatever we want. It's just one variable we have to change.

57:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, OK, cool.

57:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, there are normal edge cases in the background, like the synthetic user has to chat one day at a time, like only one day, five minutes or two minutes, whatever we set. It won't have to reiterate. Yeah, that's the normal edge case.

57:21 - Jorge Lewis 
We can add all these edge cases, I think, one by one if we need to, right?

57:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. We have, we have to add a column here. We have to add, uh, like, uh, uh, maybe the last time, uh, he chatted and, uh, based on the last time, uh, it will add 24 hours, whether, uh, it is, uh, like, uh, greater, like it will compare the current time and the last time. And whether there is a gap of 24 hours or not, if there is not a 24 hours gap, then it won't execute that function or if there is a gap.

58:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
One point I have, the one most important question is, it is not a WebSocket, right? It is a HTTP request. Like, how can, how could we let the synthetic user run by itself? Like, okay, the condition satisfies, like, yeah. There is a gap between 24 hours maybe. Then how the synthetic agent will let know like, yeah, there is a 24 hours gap. Like the API hit.

58:39 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a good point. I think we'll have to use some sort of either edge servers or edge functions or, um, yeah, I think something related to edge functions.

58:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

59:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But we, yeah, so we'll worry about time later since that can be added on top of, um, and by the way, just a quick concept of how we can control all the time is in data in super base, we can store the time, um, like normal, like, uh, as normal, but in the, in the system, the code, we divide",270fffd7af538ddc9b36416a31b4387d,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200
21,eda53fd892d3b71fc6d696991da14666," functions.

58:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay.

59:00 - Jorge Lewis 
But we, yeah, so we'll worry about time later since that can be added on top of, um, and by the way, just a quick concept of how we can control all the time is in data in super base, we can store the time, um, like normal, like, uh, as normal, but in the, in the system, the code, we divide it by a multiplier. So that's one, one minute for us.

59:25 - Jorge Lewis 
we multiply it by a multiplier, not divide it. So 20 seconds for us, we multiply it by 100, that's 2,000 for them.

59:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, all right, let's get into it. So you can open VS Code, share a live share link. So it's 1.30, we've already done an hour. Let's do 30 more minutes if you don't mind. Just so we can get some coding in.

59:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, sure.

1:00:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, I have sent in the chat.

1:00:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
Can you access it?

1:00:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Trying now.

1:01:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I create a column here that the last time maybe, because that's the starting point to write the function, the last time compared by the current time.

1:01:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, could you say that again? I was working on the VS code thing.

1:01:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so I was telling like, we have to like, as I said, before, we have to add a time variable in the synthetic table, like the last run.

1:01:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, last executed. Oh, yeah. So We can compare the last executed with the current time. And if that is not more than 24 hours, then that synthetic user won't execute. And if it is more than two hours or maybe equal to, then we can execute.

1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but what I would suggest is we ignore the time controlling first because that will expand the scope a lot and there's so many different edge cases to manage that it'll kind of not allow us to focus on getting something first. So we have this task, we have to make a simulation system. We need this system, we want to, we want to get something done, something that we can see the smallest thing that we can see is going to be one conversation back and forth. We don't need to worry about time. It's just a user having the synthetic user having a conversation with the ball. You can have a stop button so that they don't forever go on.

1:03:03 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:03:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then later you can already be excited to see that you can have conversations. And, um, yeah.

1:03:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
Got it.

1:03:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
So first thing, what should we start like with the super base creating functions or what else? What do you suggest?

1:03:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So I'll leave it up to you. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it up to you. You, you can think, okay, we've got a couple of things to do. I'm just picking one. Usually it works pretty well. Just starting. It's hard to find the right answer because they're all OK.

1:03:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Because the main thing that is coming to my mind is that function to create.

1:04:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
I'm thinking how to execute that.

1:04:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so one thing we can do is and getting this for this. You we have to create a rag over here like the sorry the graph sorry the graph will be similar to this everything will be similar to this folder but that will make the easy and the starting point will be

1:06:14 - Hasnain sayyed 
graph Okay.

1:06:17 - Hasnain sayyed 
Everything I think will be similar, uh, to this folder itself. Uh, just, uh, this folder is calling the real user. It will, in this folder, we will be calling the synthetic user. And additionally, uh, the top layer will be the edge case that we have talked like the time variable.

1:06:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Right.

1:06:37 - Jorge Lewis 
We, we, I don't think so. Are you, are you suggesting we just copy and paste the AI folder?

1:06:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, yes. Or I don't like, are you saying that the not copy pasting, like, uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar",eda53fd892d3b71fc6d696991da14666,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200
22,d33543a2b8137db4a253fd1aa152a427,", uh, in the synthetic user, it will be having a chat with, uh, AI agent, right. Uh, and the AI agent code won't invoke by itself. We have to, uh, create a flow between, uh, these two, uh, the synthetic and the AI agent. So, uh, in the current folder itself in the AI agent, uh, folder, there is a chat between real user and the AI agent. So the code for the AI agent will similar.

1:07:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:07:32 - Jorge Lewis 
In the AI folder, there's one function that's being called somewhere, run. So inside run.

1:07:43 - Jorge Lewis 
There's one function that's been called run. This is to interact with the chatbot. We're here, we're passing it profile ID, we're passing it user message and user examples prompt. Profile ID is the only thing that's going to be different.

1:08:05 - Jorge Lewis 
So in, within synthetic user, what we need to do is somehow call this run function, right? Correct.

1:08:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Correct.

1:08:13 - Jorge Lewis 
We, in essence, we need to call the run function.

1:08:16 - Hasnain sayyed 
So, and the top layer will just be the like, the edge case function that I have talked like one day, one conversation, like one day, one session, the top layer will be that the edge case condition. And we just have to create a loop over here because in this file, it's just a one case scenario, like a one way scenario. It's not a loop where it's just a HTTP request, like pointing, running this function and getting the return for one conversation. But we have to create a loop kind of thing over here.

1:08:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
Based on time.

1:08:58 - Jorge Lewis 
As we discussed, 30 seconds or 1 minute.

1:09:09 - Jorge Lewis 
As I said, we have to reduce the scope right now. We want to focus on one thing right now. When you're developing software, if you're worrying about all the 30 different things that have to be made, You're never going to make one thing. Right now, we want to get a conversation happening between the bot and the user. Then we can worry about adding in time into the code. So we need to isolate small things to make.

1:09:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I copy paste this thing over here?

1:09:42 - Jorge Lewis 
This function? No, no.

1:09:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
I just have to change this thing. The user message will be not the parameter itself. It will be the previous. We will be getting it from the database or the few short.

1:10:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
What do you mean, few short?

1:10:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
The database, like the prompt that a Q1 is adding from the dashboard.

1:10:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
The user message will be, in the real use case, will be passed by the real user, right? But in the synthetic user, it doesn't have any, like, the user message from the real user. We have to get it from database, which will be in the scenario of future.

1:10:36 - Jorge Lewis 
For the synthetic user, we should be using a language model. There should be an agent.

1:10:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
OK.

1:10:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
So based on the- Yeah.

1:10:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Because we're trying to pretend this guy's a user. There's no reason not to use a language model. We're trying to create new data, not reuse old data.

1:11:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Got it.

1:11:13 - Jorge Lewis 
I was just saying- So I'm going to try to kind of start you off and see if it makes sense. So we have this run function that's being called by the dev bot. Let's go into the simple dev user. Let's import that function.

1:11:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me enable my copilot.

1:11:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, my co-pilot subscription ended.

1:12:28 - Jorge Lewis 
And then here, we know we want to call run. What are the properties?

1:12:41 - Jorge Lewis 
These are profile ID, so it's a string ID. What else?

1:12:53 - Jorge Lewis 
User message.

1:12:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So we need to message to do AI generated message.

1:13:07 - Jorge Lewis 
And then use example prompts just do hmm. What does that mean?

1:13:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh?

1:13:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's just a boolean template.

1:13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah false okay, so So we have this here const ID is So we need to get this ID from a We need to get this ID from SuperBase.

1:13:39 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, so just right here, maybe.

1:13:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So for now, let's use a hard-coded ID. So I'm going to go into SuperBase and",d33543a2b8137db4a253fd1aa152a427,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200

1:13:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah false okay, so So we have this here const ID is So we need to get this ID from a We need to get this ID from SuperBase.

1:13:39 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, so just right here, maybe.

1:13:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So for now, let's use a hard-coded ID. So I'm going to go into SuperBase and copy one from the correct tables.

1:14:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Just paste over here.

1:14:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
And it will be synthetic user.

1:14:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Synthetic profile, sorry.

1:14:33 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I'm going to copy this one.

1:14:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, no, this is just, yeah.

1:15:00 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know how you guys don't use super base. I mean, I'll compile it.

1:15:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Profile for, okay, so. Okay, so let's make a new file that generates a message. Message, yes. And then here we can just do prompt run.

1:15:50 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I've made just a simple run function and, or let me actually just.

1:16:00 - Jorge Lewis 
And then, okay.

1:16:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, I'm messing up with your if code.

1:16:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Why?

1:16:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, are you error tracking or?

1:16:42 - Hasnain sayyed 
Should I add this data types like synthetic user in the database.types? So this error will be gone.

1:16:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me, I'm not seeing your screen. Over here. Yes. I don't have some of the highlighting because I'm on your live share.

1:17:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Generate the new types.

1:17:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes.

1:17:15 - Jorge Lewis 
That's a good idea.

1:17:28 - Jorge Lewis 
If there's only one super base call in the script or in the code, you don't want to name them. You can just leave them. So this is pretty, should be pretty obvious, I think.

1:17:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye!

1:18:18 - Jorge Lewis 
It's now gone.

1:19:11 - Hasnain sayyed 
We have to create an agent which passes this message.

1:19:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, yeah, it's generate message is there.

1:19:30 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm not getting all of the error highlighting that you are by the way.

1:20:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
What are we creating next?

1:21:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Next is.

1:21:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Could you keep sharing your screen? Because it was quite helpful.

1:21:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so we're going to, what's the statement? So we have a message.

1:22:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So, imagine the message history is no messages, so we're going to have the synthetic user generate a message first, and then the AdaptBot will reply to it. We need to wrap all this in a for loop.

1:22:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Which one? This?

1:22:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So the synthetic user and the response to that need to be looped if we want to kind of have a conversation. So let's say we want to have a conversation of 10 messages.

1:22:46 - Hasnain sayyed 
We can just do a for loop for So based on the user response, maybe like Sorry, based on the user question, we can point like, yeah, it's 10. Or maybe a normal pointer while const let a is equal to 10.

1:23:21 - Jorge Lewis 
2 Use a for loop, no?

1:23:29 - Hasnain sayyed 
Maybe, yes.

1:23:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I can't remember the syntax, though, so I'm going to search it up.

1:23:39 - Jorge Lewis 
For loop syntax, OK.

1:23:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's equal to 0, then 10.

1:23:56 - Hasnain sayyed 
A plus plus.

1:23:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:23:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
This is the basic syntax and it will be running 10 times.

1:24:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
The messages will be passing through this and RES we have to store this thing because the run function is performing actions on this as well.

1:24:35 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, we have events.

1:24:44 - Hasnain sayyed 
The one thing over here is, if you look my screen, yeah, so in the post chat, the events, it is storing the chat in events. So we have to club this ID to the events itself. Because the profile ID is also pointing to events.

1:25:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
What do you mean?

1:25:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
What do you mean?

1:25:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
Like the history, the chat history is being stored in this event table. Yep. So this profile ID has a foreign key in this events.

1:25:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
Does it?

1:25:28 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

1:25:38 - Hasnain sayyed 
Where is that?

1:25:41 - Hasnain sayyed 
Ok, so it's externally storing. I failed. I thought.

1:25:52 - Jorge Lewis 
OK. So it is linked, though. It is linked. Go back to Superbase. There's a green icon next to it. That means it's linked. That means there's a foreign key.

1:26:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So no, on profile ID, that green icon, that means it's linked. No, no, no. Back where you were. Do you see the icon? Yeah, yeah. It's a foreign key with profile. So let's open up that detail of the column so that we can modify it. Because if it's foreign link to profile table, that means we can't add events from our synthetic user, which we want to. So let's see if we can add a foreign link.

1:26:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, there we go.

Nice.

1:27:26 - Jorge Lewis 
File is foreign key constraint.

1:27:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me see...

1:27:49 - Jorge Lewis 
Because if that doesn't work, but it should, if that doesn't work...

1:27:55 - Jorge Lewis 
I think the problem is that there's already items in that...

1:28:09 - Jorge Lewis 
There's already items in the table, which means that it can't switch it. So what we have to do is either delete all the items. Is that OK? Can we do that?

1:28:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes, or else we can't edit this thing. Can't edit the value.

1:28:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, so the only thing is if Kuhn is testing it, but I don't think he is. So let's just delete everything.

1:28:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
And if he says, why did you delete everything that we say in the synthetic profile, uh, we can delete and we can check, uh, if it's added because I feel, uh, the ID is similar, uh, but that doesn't the case.

1:29:10 - Hasnain sayyed 
let me delete this and try in the synthetic.

No, the problem was because every row in the, or every row in the events table was linked, was a foreign key link to the profile ID. The structure of the cell was a foreign key link to profile ID. It was not foreign key. I wasn't a foreign key link to profile ID or, um, Uh, forward key to the profile ID or the synthetic profile ID. So now it is because I deleted all the events.

1:29:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

1:29:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So now we shouldn't have an issue with it.

1:30:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay, so we can copy this supervisor agent code over here, because whoa, in this file, what say there's there's Sorry, I was just looking at the code.

1:31:02 - Jorge Lewis 
There's a lot of, there's a prompt. So, okay. I see. Huh? So you know how, you know that we're exposing the prompts on the front end, right?

1:31:13 - Hasnain sayyed 
Hmm.

1:31:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, so I saw that under supervisor, there is a lot of, there is, um, his system. What is this? Yeah. So, so if you follow me, Hmm. So here we give it its prompts here, but then we're also giving it more. This should be, we should try to, this is kind of as a backlog. I know this is probably temporary, but there should be a backlog for somebody to migrate it to the front end because we want everything, all the prompts to be exposed to the front end. So yeah, we need to.

I know this is probably temporary, but there should be a backlog for somebody to migrate it to the front end because we want everything, all the prompts to be exposed to the front end. So yeah, we need to.

1:31:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
On the backend, right?

1:31:58 - Jorge Lewis 
No, no, it's the front end. We don't want text here. We don't want this text here. What we want to do is be using the data tape, the super base and accessing the prompts from there, which admins can modify from the front end.

1:32:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

1:32:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So we don't want to hard code the prompts here.

1:32:25 - Jorge Lewis 
But instead, we want to use a promise for the profile. So yeah, that's something to note out. So what is this here?

1:32:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, you can click on me somewhere.

1:32:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
Uh, could you also share your screen? Uh, I can.

1:33:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:33:03 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Okay. So, so we have this, this loop.

1:33:27 - Jorge Lewis 
I just copied this thing So we don't need this here Okay, so...

1:34:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Why is that still saying? Oh, expected zero. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Sorry. Okay, this is the...

1:34:18 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, we can edit this.

1:34:21 - Jorge Lewis 
This is the new guy. I thought this was the super generate message function.

1:34:29 - Hasnain sayyed 
So this, uh, this file is different. This is a generate message function. We can just, uh, let the LLM to generate, uh, the question on the behalf of synthetic agent. So, uh, the prompt, the prompt will be different.

1:34:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
Is that make sense? Yeah, we just remove this all.

1:35:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Correct.

1:35:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So this is not a structure of profile. I believe this is a synthetic user.

1:35:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

1:35:39 - Jorge Lewis 
What was the definition of this profile though?

1:35:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Over here. So we can do type, uh, then back here.

1:36:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. It's not profiled. It's it's in. Yeah, there is no S. Correct. And this we have to export over here.

1:36:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:36:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So, is this correct over here? System and then, or is this a tuple?

1:36:31 - Jorge Lewis 
And then I have to do prompts.

1:36:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Or how was it before? Let me just copy this.

1:36:39 - Jorge Lewis 
So, it's a list. Oh, it's just the two, okay.

1:36:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So prompts teams, okay, so this is going to change from Like it's just prompt this is not gonna be using So how How should we go about structuring the profile structure? So if you see on my screen We have the prompt is Is it these three?

1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Hmm.

1:37:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Or well, we're actually. Okay. So let me think.

1:37:28 - Jorge Lewis 
So this objective is, it can be just prompt. Personality can be part of the prompt and LM. Okay. Okay. So these two are just part of the prompt. So inside of the structure of here of synthetic profile, Should I re-upload the file?

1:37:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Because I have deleted.

1:37:53 - Hasnain sayyed 
Re-upload the file? Which file?

1:37:55 - Hasnain sayyed 
The CSV from the profile. So we will be having the users in the synthetic one. Like, do you want- I think, I think.

1:38:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:38:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Go ahead. Yes.

1:38:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, actually, you know what we could do to make it more dynamic and probably better, just a lot better code is within anywhere in the original code that's accessing the profile. So let me, let me go to man to kind of illustrate what I mean. So this function here is returning a profile, right?

1:38:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
Right. Just a second. Yes.

1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.

1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
It will be false for the default value",69ebdc63af25394c5554e2d5ecb3bdb9,['26d7cf14a001cde110fdb272956dee61'],1200

1:38:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So this profile here is referring to the, like an actual user. What we can do is do something like, so we take in another Boolean synthetic.

1:38:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:38:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
It will be false for the default value. You can put the default value as well.

1:38:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. Good point. And then we do table. Synthetic.

1:39:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Or just do profile table.

1:39:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
Is it profile?

1:39:19 - Jorge Lewis 
We want to make sure it's, they're all the same. That's a big, that's important.

1:39:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So profiles with an S. So we wanted this one to be profiles with an S.

1:39:33 - Jorge Lewis 
There's of course best practices in terms of should we use S or not, but at least make them all the same. So if they all use S, use S.

1:39:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay.

1:39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Which means I believe in, yeah, I already added S, okay, nice. Or did you? Okay, so it comes, what else? And I think that's, it's just that table that we're changing, right?

1:39:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:39:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Or just do synthetic, we don't need it, we can just clean this up a bit.

1:40:15 - Hasnain sayyed 
I've added the data over you.

1:40:19 - Jorge Lewis 
So pretty much like that. And then we use, Oh, is that you?

1:40:30 - Jorge Lewis 
No.

1:40:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Huh?

1:40:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, So, what type, what does this take in?

1:40:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think the row, maybe?

1:41:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, I think I know.

1:41:11 - Jorge Lewis 
If you go into database.types, it takes in...

1:41:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Take some of these things.

1:41:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Tables.

1:41:29 - Jorge Lewis 
How do I? Where's the

1:42:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
How should we add?

1:42:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
Let me try.

1:42:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Bye.

1:43:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, I mean, if we use...

1:43:07 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, have you found the solution?

1:43:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So, not yet, but just kind of to think it through, this does take in a string, or it ends up being a string, but it's just typed differently. So maybe, or maybe actually. We can use this code.

1:43:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:43:41 - Jorge Lewis 
So if I put the string, if I do this, it works.

1:43:48 - Jorge Lewis 
But I want to reuse this variable profile table since we… I think use it down? Oh no, it's just once.

1:44:06 - Jorge Lewis 
We're only asking, we're only making the simple base request once, so I guess we can use this, but I wonder maybe we should figure it out instead of

1:44:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Let me try one thing.

1:45:02 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

1:45:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
That's it.

1:46:00 - Hasnain sayyed 
At 10 o'clock, she would get up and leave. What? Again? She would leave at 2.30 in the morning. You would come at 8.30?

1:46:12 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, no. She would come at 6.30 in the morning. She would come at 8.30 the morning. Sometimes, she would come late at night. She would come late at night and leave early in the morning. She would leave early in the morning. I would come at the 8.30 morning. She would come at 8.30 in the morning. I would eat and leave.

1:46:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
You think he made any progress?

1:47:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
I don't know.

1:47:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think that's better actually.

1:47:57 - Jorge Lewis 
But I can't tell because my screen doesn't show me the correct things.

1:48:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Showing you any errors? Yeah.

1:48:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think we both are in different areas.

1:48:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
Tables, it's not as stable, I think.

1:48:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Maybe.

1:48:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I mean, I'm fairly certain that the one here should work.

1:49:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you, it just, our screens are different. Yeah. Okay, let me, looks like we're going to disconnect it, I guess.

1:49:52 - Hasnain sayyed 
I mean, why is tables erroring there?

1:50:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Hey, have you seen my daughter-in-law? Yes, she has gone to work.

1:50:25 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, really? Yes, she has gone to work. Why are you so late today? Are you busy? Yes, I am busy. Yes, I am busy.

1:50:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yes I have to go at 6.30.

1:50:51 - Jorge Lewis 
I have to go I have to go at 6.30 I don't know why it's taking so long to load. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen, my camera so that, to see if it can go faster.

1:51:33 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

1:51:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, but yeah, it's just super slow. Like I clicked it's joining collaboration session for quite a while. Okay. But, um, okay. So I'll, I'll just ask you to do it. So instead of, so take copy and paste everything after the question mark.

1:51:57 - Hasnain sayyed 
This one.

1:51:58 - Jorge Lewis 
So the second one should be a cool one.

1:52:04 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Yeah.

1:52:12 - Jorge Lewis 
But anyway, so copy copy those two so the table synthetic profile and tables profile the whole the whole thing Now it doesn't like it Oh no, there we go, cool. Is it airing for you?

1:52:51 - Hasnain sayyed 
Unknown word, it's failing.

1:52:56 - Jorge Lewis 
I think it's just slow to update.

1:53:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you try... It looks like it's just confused. It's the same type of string, but it thinks it's something else. Like we just labeled it as something else. So all we need to do is just use the types that it needs. So we're synthetic here on the right-hand side of the equals is just is saying making it a string. But then we're just typing it as a tables synthetic profile. But for me, it's not giving any errors. But for you, it is. It's just saying it doesn't know what it is.

1:53:59 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's also getting error in the profile as well.

1:54:09 - Hasnain sayyed 
I said maybe.

1:54:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you push and then save all and push and I'll try to open it locally? Because it just feels like the IDE is not being very happy.

1:54:54 - Hasnain sayyed 
So should I push while creating a new branch?

1:54:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah.

1:55:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, create a new branch.

1:55:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
What should be the branch name?

1:55:29 - Jorge Lewis 
What did you suggest?

1:55:31 - Hasnain sayyed 
Features and synthetic profile.

1:55:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
Maybe.

1:55:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, or yes.

1:55:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, whatever. That works.

1:56:07 - Jorge Lewis

1:56:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:56:33 - Unidentified Speaker

The superbase types.

1:57:11 - Hasnain sayyed 
The interface?

1:57:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So we made a new table. Have you generated the new types for it?

1:57:23 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah, I've created the types over here.

1:57:33 - Hasnain sayyed

Yeah, I pushed on GitHub.

1:58:13 - Unidentified Speaker

2:00:20 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh.

2:00:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Yeah, so my thing doesn't error. Does your thing still error with the type? Yes. Try restarting your IDE.

2:01:31 - Jorge Lewis 
No, it's a very old name, so I shouldn't...

2:01:36 - Hasnain sayyed 
of extension which gets an error if my spelling mistake is there, so.

2:01:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Oh, so is that what's erring?

2:01:49 - Hasnain sayyed 
No, no, it's not the extension one.

2:01:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, there's two. TypeString is not assignable to type.

2:02:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, maybe...

2:02:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, do. So I'm trying to figure out why I'm not getting those errors.

2:02:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, but try, try the string. So go to the strings and do as tables and then.

2:02:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Where in the data type.

2:02:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so when you're setting the screen, no, no. So right where you are, right where you are back, you want to cast the string to the type. So. Synthetic underscore profiles as, and then tables synthetic profiles. No, no, no, up, up, on the string, on the string.

2:02:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So the variable, the string, synthetic profiles, the string.

2:02:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

2:02:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Down, yeah.

2:02:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so we want to cast it as the table.

2:03:03 - Jorge Lewis 
Cannot, there's no type string to type.

2:03:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait a minute. Why is...

2:03:30 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's also getting type string is not assignable to the row.

2:03:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right.

2:03:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, are we spent enough time on this? So I had to do, um, and make, and just use the hard coded one.

2:06:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bye.

2:07:37 - Hasnain sayyed 
Welcome back.

2:07:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So is it all done now?

2:07:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:07:47 - Hasnain sayyed 
Is that problem solved?

2:07:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Well, which problem? All right, cool.

2:07:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah. The type.

2:07:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

2:07:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, no, no, it's not solved. So the problem was that the problem is that we need to access either the synthetic profile or the user profile right there. We're only accessing the profile. We need, so the solution is to just move. So take a look. Let me share my screen.

2:08:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Like the whole world, what we're solving, I feel like you kind of tunnel vision too much on what we're on the typing issue. The, what we're trying to do here is, is set this profile to either be from the synthetic profile or the profile list. That's what we were doing up here. So we were trying to set up. We're trying to do this and make it a variable, but instead we're just going to copy this and then paste it here. This profile here will either be from the synthetic profiles or the profiles.

2:09:01 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. Well, I thought it can be.

2:09:18 - Jorge Lewis 
One thing we need to be careful of that maybe is that if there's any properties of these two that if profiles has something that synthetic profiles doesn't, then there might be an error at some point. I don't think so.

2:09:34 - Hasnain sayyed 
Because it has copy paste.

2:09:39 - Hasnain sayyed 
It's the same. I copy pasted the same.

2:09:44 - Hasnain sayyed

2:09:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Cool. All right. So I'll just push this in.

2:10:02 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, go ahead and pull. And yeah, I'm a hop off. It's been a great session. I think very productive.

2:10:08 - Hasnain sayyed 
I think we learned a lot.

2:10:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So for now, I guess just keep working on this and then, um, and then, yeah, keep me updated. So it's clear what the objectives are, right. And how we should move forward with this.

2:10:24 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. So for now, uh, we will be using the loop, right. Uh, for, uh, iterating for the 10 times.

2:10:32 - Hasnain sayyed 
Or should I create a function? OK.

2:10:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Just do that for now. And then once we can see something on the screen, then we'll move forward. We need to do it step by step, because it's a very big issue that most new developers have, is that they try to make the whole application And then it takes them three months and within that three months they never finish something that they can test. Not test as in make unit tests, not test as in no errors. Test as in see the experience so it's very important that we that when we're making these projects and you're developing is you focus on very small things that you can test as an end and you so in this case what we can test as an end user the smallest thing is we can see a AI the synthetic user having a conversation with a chatbot that's all we need like we all we need to see is they can send messages to each other basic that's it hmm And then after we can see that, then we work on expanding it little by little. But it's very important that we see the progress through the testing that like with the end user.

2:11:50 - Hasnain sayyed 
Okay. Okay. I will work on this and make it as functional as a basic level and then we can move step by step.

2:11:58 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool.

2:12:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, I think you'll have to work with, um, I think you'll have to work with one of the front-end developers to get the front-end for this done. So whether Will or Nazif, kind of bring them both in a call and ask and demonstrate or tell them, hey, we have this new task. How can we go about working on this? Check who's busy or who's not.

2:12:27 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah. Okay. I will ask them right now.

2:12:33 - Jorge Lewis 
doing this programming session. Looking forward to the ones to come. I think it's a great way to keep growing.

2:12:45 - Hasnain sayyed 
Yeah.

2:12:48 - Hasnain sayyed 
Correct then. I will update you once I will get our achieving done. Okay.

2:12:55 - Jorge Lewis

Wed, Aug 28, 2024

0:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let me share my screen so that when someone is watching this, they understand what I'm talking about. All right.

0:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let's start from the top. So this is the division mission workshop for content.

0:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's make sure we're on the same page. So today we're just going to align on those two things. Here's a quick example of what the vision and mission are. The mission is explaining why are we trying to build this? What problem is it solving? And then what is the solution? So building an online platform to solve this problem. So yeah, so let's get into the mission. So with a mission, what we'll do first is have me say off the top of my head, the problem we're trying to solve.

1:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So, PO, project owner, will explain how the idea behind the project was conceived, what problem arised that gave him the idea of IntelliO.

1:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so the project was conceived because the past two weeks or three weeks I have spent a lot of effort and time into writing, trying to write content, but haven't gotten anywhere.

1:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Number one, I like writing, I like that aspect, but it just takes too much time to write things on paper or on Notion or whatever, to put things down.

1:51 - Jorge Lewis 
It takes a lot of mental effort and time to get those onto paper and then into a script or whatever.

1:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So like I've tried writing content and just hasn't worked out I have time for it, but I just I'm I guess I'm It's too much effort I guess you could say I have better things to do than writing content

2:11 - Biwas bhandari 
or at least yeah But if content yeah sometimes you feel like, okay, I want to write about this, but you cannot start writing in the copy about all the scripts.

2:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a form of writer's block, but also, yeah. Kind of procrastination, but it's like I have better things to do. I'm not I'm gonna save this for later. So procrastination Okay, so with that said let's take just two minutes to notes our interpretation of what I just said and then What the mission is I think you've already done it, but if you want to try again Yeah, I think my one links with your Alright, I've got mine.

3:23 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, yeah. I finished mine too.

3:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, so Marina, why is yours the same color?

3:30 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me change it.

3:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, thanks.

3:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so let's read yours. So the project owner will usually read his out first, I believe. Reduce time and efforts required to write content. So that's what I put. And for yours, the mission of the product is to help make content and brainstorm about it. The problem is, is it takes a lot of time to brainstorm about the content I'm making and the current AI tools congeneration is not it. Okay, that's perfect. Your one's great.

4:03 - Biwas bhandari 
No, yours one is like my summarized form.

4:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so one thing we noticed in the last one when we did this with Jonas was his was too many things. So...

4:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so we'll take your one. Let me copy it. And then what we do is we bring it here, and we get a new note, and we put the mission.

4:41 - Jorge Lewis 
And under, the mission. Okay, so we can shorten here. So the mission of the product is to help make content um creation and ideation so ideation is the brainstorm part um faster and or is to make it easier so faster and less mental effort okay because that's that's the problem okay So this part's a good point. The current AI tools for content generation is not good, but I don't think it doesn't belong in the mission. So I'll just bring that over and paste it somewhere here.

5:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so the mission of the product is, so we don't have to say this, so help. So, or not help, just make content creation, content creation and ideation, Why is it saying ideation is not a word? I think it is. Yeah, it is. It's the formation of ideas or concepts, but all right then, buddy. Make content creation and ideation easier, faster by requiring... Okay, just by making it faster and require less mental effort. Okay, cool.

6:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Now on to the vision. So P.O.

6:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Afterwards, P.O. And then P.O.

6:43 - Jorge Lewis 
So P.O. Will give a high level explanation of his idea and vision of the project. Afterwards, I'll invite everyone to write down their motivation behind working on the project.

6:56 - Biwas bhandari 
Can I invite everyone? What do you mean?

7:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just going to tell everyone. All right, everyone, let's do this now.

7:08 - Jorge Lewis 
After everyone is done, we'll collaborate, collaboratively compare all",1b14ef8cb8f0c21aee065c204aff83e8,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200

6:56 - Biwas bhandari 
Can I invite everyone? What do you mean?

7:04 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just going to tell everyone. All right, everyone, let's do this now.

7:08 - Jorge Lewis 
After everyone is done, we'll collaborate, collaboratively compare all the ideas. Yeah. Okay. So. The vision, so this is really, this is great when you have a lot of like more than a few people. When it's two people, it's, it's very fast and there's only two things. So it's not too much to worry about, which is why I asked Jonas if he could join, because he could give more input. So.

7:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So the idea, so what I imagine this is, and the vision is kind of the end goal of this entire project. It's not a It can be like the very end goal. So for example, for, for adapt, it could be the vision is a chatbot can help coach the user to build habits.

8:04 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

8:06 - Jorge Lewis 
To build good habits. I think that's it. That's the vision. A chatbot building good habits for users.

8:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. How we do that, there's a lot of different ways, but that's the end goal. The chapel will help users build habits. So for this one, what I think, what I like this project to become, well, is I can sit, so I'm going to kind of just draw a story. So I want to wake up, have my coffee. And this is when I usually like to write or do my creative things. Cause I'm just, I've got my coffee. It's morning. I want to be in the chair and just.

8:41 - Jorge Lewis 
like have content there that I just refine. So content is generated and I can refine it. And that content is something I agree with. It's in the style that I like, It doesn't sound like AI at all. And to convert it into an actual post or script, it's not a lot of work. Meaning I only have to change some small things. It doesn't have to be perfect, of course. Well, I mean, of course Google is perfect. I ask it to make something about a topic and it'll tell me, it'll run me through a process to create the content. For example, I want to make a video about the best way to build a SaaS as a non-technical person.

9:33 - Jorge Lewis 
I want it to know what my opinions are on that whole topic. And if it doesn't, I want it to ask me, okay, what do you think about this? What about this? What about this? To build a knowledge base around this whole topic so that it can understand how I would write this. Because a lot of content is so opinion-based. Building fact-based content is very easy. You can research things and find facts.

9:59 - Jorge Lewis 
What people are after for content is experienced people that have done it before that can use their experience to provide advice. And I would say I have some experience that I want to be sharing. Instead of just kind of regurgitating everything like, oh, you should raise funding and then you should do this. Like kind of the very basic things. I don't want it to be that. I don't want this project to be a regurgitation of a Google search. I don't want it to kind of search Google and then print whatever it finds.

10:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

10:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

10:38 - Biwas bhandari 
I can keep going, but there's, um, But that can be done in normal AI chatbots like chatGPT. You can just ask, okay, I want to do this and it will reply instantly. So what's the selling point of this product?

11:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Um, it's like, it's like, why would I come to these, uh, the content app instead of going to chatGPT?

11:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so this, this right.

11:14 - Jorge Lewis 
I want this project to write your content, not chat, UBT's content or not the internet's content. I want it to be based off of the, the, the user. So the project's going to need to know a lot about the user, whether it can ask questions or it can take some input, wink, wink transcript. Yeah.

11:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so I have a lot of ideas and like features, ways we can do this, but I think the vision aspect of this is supposed to be very high level. So I think hopefully I've done an okay job at keeping it high level. Let's go into our corners and rights.

11:57 - Biwas bhandari 
So the vision?

11:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the vision.

11:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

32,7f244d6708a31d7f4ed5dd1a7172b914," Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the vision.

11:59 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

12:10 - Biwas bhandari 
vision PR plus PC don't understand All right, I'm done. I want to understand and create, okay. All right.

13:24 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I'll go ahead and read mine first. A platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the style but also the opinions and experiences, leading to no necessary modifications post-generation.

13:41 - Jorge Lewis 
To understand and create content through a user's perspective and generate content based on his or her vision.

13:49 - Biwas bhandari 
And both of the lines are same. Mine was. After that end, it's the same. I just realized it. Oh yeah.

14:03 - Jorge Lewis 
User's perspective and vision.

14:07 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

14:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So this part we've got aligned. We want it to be based on the user's perspective and vision.

14:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

14:17 - Jorge Lewis 
And I phrase that as style, opinions, and experiences.

14:29 - Biwas bhandari 
So let's say instead of, uh, instead of, uh, instead of no necessary modifications, I think some, we need to modify it to some content.

14:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But at the end, the vision of this is that I can just ask it to make something regarding a topic and it can go ahead and make something.

14:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Oh.

14:52 - Jorge Lewis 
or even not even I don't want to like the vision isn't I want to ask it to make content about something I wanted to just make content like on like as if it were me like completely autonomous okay yeah so maybe I can I can so a platform that writes content so we're leaving out to the part where Because the vision shouldn't be the implementation of, oh, I ask it for content and then it makes content. It's just, this is what it, I want it to write content and then we can figure out the rest.

15:27 - Biwas bhandari 
It's like instead of hiring a content writer, you come to our platform and tell us about your perspective and what content you want to make.

15:38 - Jorge Lewis 
And that's the hard part, getting your, the user's perspective to this chatbot, like very well, like done.

15:45 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

15:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

15:56 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Wait, there's also, so a platform that writes content as if it were me, not only the styles style, but also the opinions and experiences leading to Okay. How do you think that is that good? Or what do you think?

16:18 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, it's good. No. But we need to be able to tell it to modify it later. For example, like we if we if you are a content, if you are a content writer, you will say, Okay, I don't like this part, please modify it or something.

16:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So the end goal is I can just, it just posts content, it writes and posts content for me, I guess, is the end goal, the vision. So a platform that writes or...

16:52 - Jorge Lewis 
That I'm going to say creates content and creates what can mean what writes publish and all of the above. The creates.

17:03 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Does it align with the mission in the mission? We says make content creation and ideas and fast. Oh yeah. There's creation to creation.

17:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So creation, I guess, is both writing the content.

17:21 - Jorge Lewis 
and everything between publishing it. And we're using the word content here, but we know that since we've kind of already briefed ourselves on what this is, at first it'll start with just text content since it's easiest. And that's where we get into it in the roadmap afterwards. So let's just stay on track. So it writes the content as if it were me without necessary modifications, without, okay. And these things will change, by the way, over time, if I'm not mistaken. Like as we go, we can read this every week and say, oh, we've actually changed the mission, I think. Like, I'm just guessing. It usually stays the same, but I think the vision might change here and there. It changes more often, but they both change. So now we get into, let's delete this, this, and then copy this. That's the vision. And here's the mission.

18:17 - Jorge Lewis 
So the product vision board is, okay. So what is, so this is, we can both just fill in at the same time. This is kind of like a group task where we can just each take a part.

18:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

18:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me check. So what is, okay, so let's just vision. What is your purpose in creating the product?

18:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

18:47 - Biwas bhandari 
Targeted group, it's...

19:01 - Biwas bhandari

18:47 - Biwas bhandari 
Targeted group, it's...

19:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry?

19:07 - Biwas bhandari 
Can I fill the other empty tabs?

19:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. At the end we can just refute to make sure we're all aligned.

19:14 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

19:15 - Biwas bhandari 
Targeted groups.

19:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Now what problem does the paradox solve?

20:49 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, are content writers expensive to hire or something?

20:56 - Biwas bhandari 
Depends.

21:00 - Biwas bhandari 
It depends, I think.

21:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Well, they're more expensive than this, so.

21:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh, yeah.

21:13 - Biwas bhandari 
I think that will go into the business school or something like that.

21:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Not so much.

21:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Content creation is time consuming.

21:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Hey, darling.

22:07 - Biwas bhandari 
What?

22:17 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

22:20 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. I think this is it. Do you need to go to business schools?

22:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, yeah, once I, for the target group, one idea I have is that since, so in general with SAS and I hope whoever's watching this doesn't get bored by this, but, um, SAS there's two aspects of, of SAS. That's really hard making it and making a good product and then selling it. Selling it requires distribution, which is probably the hardest part, getting it to people that need it. For us, our means of distribution for this would be Okay, so the reason why we're advantaged at making a good product on that side is because this is going to serve me. I know I'm the customer of this, so I'll understand my own problems. And then to distribute it, I'll be able to use my network of people that are also, like one example is I could use my network for people that are also trying to start content writing for whatever they're doing. Because I know quite a lot of people instead of people, a lot of entrepreneurs and business owners that are getting into content writing, but they're struggling with kind of doing it and their own business. But because everyone right now understands the value of content writing and how important it is to build the brand and all that.

23:45 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

23:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, and then, yeah, for this also to help the selling part is since I understand the problems, I can present this better to potential users since I, I can use my own pains.

23:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

24:02 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe, I think I can rephrase it to business or entrepreneurs, I think, because that's the term they use on all their social media and stuff. So entrepreneurs trying to, or that do content creation.

24:26 - Jorge Lewis 
They either do it or they're trying to, no, because if they, One thing to think about is if we, well, I was going to write entrepreneurs that are trying to get into content creation, but that's not really a market because those people that have it, that are trying to get into it, I don't think they're going to understand the value this brings. Like, I don't know if that's, maybe, maybe I'm wrong, but I think starting with people that are already making content and saying, Hey, we can save you this many hours is a much better sell than, Hey, we could save you this many hours instead of we will save you if you buy this.

25:01 - Biwas bhandari 
Yes, someone who is getting into the content creation will come back later after he knows that, oh, it's so much of hassle to brainstorm about it.

25:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So, and then, okay, who are the target customers and users? Business owners with no prior knowledge in content creation, but wants to write content for his or her business. That's interesting, yeah?

25:25 - Biwas bhandari 
So, yeah.

25:27 - Jorge Lewis 
That's very interesting because... There's so many people that this could target. It's a matter of picking. The reason I'm picking entrepreneurs is because it's my network. But my network also includes my dad. And he has a lot of friends that are also running a business.

25:47 - Jorge Lewis 
They could have a lot of improvements if they start content creation. If we're targeting businesses that don't do content creation already, we have two jobs. We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?

26:10 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just",745bfd7a954ca85cae41f49356ddb953,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200
34,5e1c302445bd27302c342e6dd69cdb91," If we're targeting businesses that don't do content creation already, we have two jobs. We have to convince them to start, um, to convince them to buy our, our, to use our software. So I think starting with people that are already doing it as an easier sell, what do you think?

26:10 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, we can tell, uh, so the business owners, the benefits of content creation and all that, and they can just come to our platform to create content maybe.

26:23 - Jorge Lewis 
That's how we would sell them on it.

26:28 - Jorge Lewis 
For example, if I sold this software to me, I'm already making videos and I'm already doing it. If you tell me, hey, you probably spend 30 hours a week writing content, why not just have conversations with your friends? And use that to create content, save 30 hours and just have normal conversations instead. And I'll be like, damn, that's actually, yeah, okay. Instead, if I sell it to Jonas, where Jonas wants to start a content creation, wants to start writing content, for him, when I come to him, I'm saying, hey, when you start your business, You can, um, or you should start your content creation now because it's so important. I had to convince him of that. Why do I have to convince, why should I convince him when I'm already doing it? Like, I don't want to convince him to start and also buy this instead. I could just, they can already start by themselves and just buy it. So I would, I think I would be a better target customer than Jonas because I've already started. Yeah.

27:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

27:29 - Jorge Lewis 
But later, like this, this has a lot of potential to target like business owners as well. Like we could have a whole sales process of also including that aspect of convincing them to start content creation saying, Hey, content creation has never been easier with this. You should start content creation with our software. That could be a later, that could be our offer later, but right now I think it's better. Make your content creation easier with this.

27:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Yeah.

27:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, Okay, so we're the target customers and users. I'm going to just keep that as one question.

28:11 - Jorge Lewis 
This thing is going to change so much that it's mostly important so that everyone's always aligned through conversation, I think, rather than having it on paper.

28:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Businesses use business plans. We, specifically at Startino, use a lean business plan.

28:30 - Jorge Lewis 
The problem, what you're supposed to do is not use that as a, like that's not supposed to point you to success. That's supposed to point you to the next chapter. The next chapter is determined by whenever things change, like all the time they'll change. You have to update your business plan accordingly or your business model. Um, Because in the same way with this, it has to be updated constantly. But it's just a hassle. I haven't gone into that Google document and updated our business model. But we understand, Jonas and I, the same vision, because we always talk about it. So I think that's more important than actually a document that says it.

29:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Having it on a document is very important when you're trying to share it with other people, though.

29:16 - Jorge Lewis 
It's also useful for distilling whatever information you have into very concise forms.

29:46 - Jorge Lewis 
What benefit does it provide? What benefit does this product provide? Bro, it's the same... Bro, it's... I'm not gonna... The problem is this. Of course, it's solving the problem. What do you mean... I don't know. Yeah, I'm just lazy. It's only me and you making this and at some point, this is all gonna change, so... How is the product going to benefit the company? What are the business goals? Okay.

30:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Business goal is make money, bro. Quote my Brazilian friends. I think the first goal is to, the business goal is to allow me, allow Jorge to produce content.

30:37 - Biwas bhandari 
It will be launched as a SaaS and also it will help you yourself write content and all that.

30:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So first it needs to allow me to write content. Like, cause if I can't use this, why would I, I can't sell it, you know? So that's the goal, the first goal. Um, and at some point it's going to be launched as a SaaS.

31:00 - Jorge Lewis 
as a market leader in content, AI content creation software industry.

31:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So, we need some, I'd like some fixed, some smart goals. So, something measurable.

31:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So, to allow Jorge to produce content, You know what's interesting? It's, I don't think it's so weird because my problem with me is not that it's, so the problem is that I'm not writing content because I'm procrastinating. It's not that it's taking me too long. It's that I'm procrastinating it.

31:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So. Maybe this should be making it enjoyable enough or making it frictionless to a point where it's easy enough for me to make content. I don't",5e1c302445bd27302c342e6dd69cdb91,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200

31:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So. Maybe this should be making it enjoyable enough or making it frictionless to a point where it's easy enough for me to make content. I don't know. Do you get where I'm going? Because I don't write the Startino content right now. And this won't be making it This won't be making that faster because how do you make something faster that you don't do? So I think this is going instead of what this, what benefit does this provide is it. Convinces me to write content that content is that writing the content is worth it because the effort to make it as less.

32:35 - Biwas bhandari 
So, yeah, I think instead of saying make, uh, to help content creation easier and faster should be content creation, uh, enjoyable, maybe.

32:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Content creation what?

32:49 - Biwas bhandari 
Enjoyable, more enjoyable.

32:53 - Jorge Lewis 
I think that can be the angle because, okay, this is a perfect example. Right now, the call you and I are in, I can upload this transcript to this software and I can say, make a post about the vision and mission statement. And highlight the key points that we mentioned in this. And you can highlight things like, oh, not spending too much time on specific things or whatever. And that'll make content writing more enjoyable for me because I can, instead of writing content, do things like this, where it's just I'm having a conversation with you and it's more enjoyable. So maybe the goal could be to make it more enjoyable, maybe. I don't know.

33:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Because I've tried I tried writing blocks one two times in the blog post and medium I think I've written one two and I've slipped it but if if that would be more enjoyable like playing games and all that but

33:59 - Jorge Lewis 
That will be what if effective maybe yeah, yeah Yeah, that's interesting maybe Yeah, because like, imagine this, imagine instead of writing a script, what you do to make the content is you have a conversation about whatever that topic is with the friend. You tell the friend, Hey, can we have a conversation? I want to record it. I'm going to use it to make a script later. How does that sound? And they're like, cool.

34:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Why not?

34:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

34:39 - Jorge Lewis 
It's interesting. So, um, in, in, um, Give me one second, I'm gonna find a...

34:51 - Jorge Lewis 
A message I sent. Here. Wait.

34:57 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I don't know where... Actually, it's probably on the Obsidian. Let me find it.

35:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Don't worry, I didn't hear anything.

35:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I found it.

35:52 - Jorge Lewis 
So, I'm just going to post it as a note here. So, I think a great method to give these videos both as high quality and validated as possible is to have a recording group session.

36:13 - Jorge Lewis 
The recording should include face cams and screen cams. We'll pretend it's both a live podcast and research session. Merging the two into one in order to save time. The first half can be more of research than discussion, and the second half we can discuss about putting things on paper. So the goal of that is at the end, this makes the production of work, of creating the script, gathering footage, and researching, validating opinions, a lot more fun, and more importantly, faster. We take the recordings of the participants and use it to structure and create the actual video. Probably won't use any of the footage in the final video, but we definitely could. So, this text, by the way, was in my plan for how to do the Startino videos. When I first conceived of, okay, we should probably be doing content. So, I think we're coming back to full circle where this is a big point where it should be fun.

37:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And I think that's the issue because content writing is boring.

37:10 - Biwas bhandari 
Like I don't want to write like it's even, even if you know, yeah, it's important for me to write content.

37:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And also, yeah, it's so, okay. So maybe we can read. If we look at the mission again.

37:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:38 - Jorge Lewis 
So the problem isn't actually that it takes too much time. I think it's that it's not enjoyable enough.

37:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

37:49 - Jorge Lewis 
It's a little bit of both because I wonder if I would eventually, if I would, okay, an okay example is, okay, no, no, no. So what I've been with Jonas, whenever we, We have amazing conversations. Earlier we were just discussing about SvelteKit and when we should be using form actions versus API routes and et cetera. It was a good technical conversation. If we could just take that conversation and convert it into some form of content, whether it's",f61d96b9f14743bfd3f6deebdd54aeef,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200
36,7343c1b88dff669bbbdbe95e94bf4599," a little bit of both because I wonder if I would eventually, if I would, okay, an okay example is, okay, no, no, no. So what I've been with Jonas, whenever we, We have amazing conversations. Earlier we were just discussing about SvelteKit and when we should be using form actions versus API routes and et cetera. It was a good technical conversation. If we could just take that conversation and convert it into some form of content, whether it's a snippet of that video and we can publish that or it writes a script for us or a post, anything like that would be great. So, maybe the mission isn't that it takes too much time to write content. I think it's... Can you see where I'm going with this? It's more of trying to use what I already have, which is conversations with my team, which is conversations I already have.

39:06 - Biwas bhandari 
Trying to summarize it and write a blog or content, something like that.

39:15 - Jorge Lewis 
But what's the problem then? The problem is there's no way to repurpose our conversations, I guess. I don't know.

39:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So you see, this is where these workshops are very helpful because you, you're really trying to understand what you're trying to do here.

39:31 - Biwas bhandari 
I think it's not the, uh, what's the problem, but what we are trying to improve maybe because right now we are having a good conversation and that's good. But, uh, what, you know, what, what could make it more effective is if you just summarize it and make a blog post so everybody can read and all that. Maybe so.

39:58 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so the problem is that when people have conversations, that knowledge and that there's value in that conversation that gets lost as soon as that, that only gets shared to those two people after that conversation finishes. But instead we want to extract as much value as possible by recording it and then converting it into something, into content. Whether you publish it to the public or just your team.

40:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So the problem is that we don't extract enough values from conversations.

40:40 - Jorge Lewis 
But when I'm thinking, it doesn't sound very like, okay, the mission, instead of saying the problem, the mission is to make my conversations more valuable by being able to write content from them.

40:58 - Jorge Lewis 
That's the mission because that's pretty realistic. The only other time is that it's like maybe sometimes it's not my conversations, it's maybe a voice message I recorded on myself. Like I'm on a walk and I just want to discuss the topic and convert it into content afterwards.

41:39 - Biwas bhandari 
So, I think that one is different than what we were talking before.

41:57 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, just before we were talking about that, okay, I want to write a content, but I need to instead of spending my time on company, I'm spending time on brainstorming the brainstorming for the content. It takes too long time for that. And so in order to make it easier, I just need a tool that will help me. I'm thinking of making content on SAS, for example. And based on that, our product will generate a content or something like that, maybe.

42:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I can see. Yeah.

42:43 - Jorge Lewis 
I want to take you through a story of how I can imagine using this. So I have, I've recorded about a hundred read AI meetings between my team and clients and other people I've met within my network. So what I can imagine myself doing is uploading those transcripts or videos or whatever format to this software. And then I say, Hey, Can you write, can you help me write something about SAS on, on how to build a SAS as a non-technical founder. It'll go through all those, try to pull as much as it can from it.

43:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh yeah. So instead of pulling it from the internet and creating separate content, it will take all the transcripts you provided. And based on that, it will create a whole new content. Yeah.

43:34 - Jorge Lewis 
But there's also another aspect of this project of this, of what I want is like, I want, um, okay, okay, I'm getting, so, okay, okay, let me, I'm gonna go on top of the mission, the blue card, so, why is that so small? So, writing, or, having conversations is more fun than writing.

44:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Dumb? Yeah.

44:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Using other's posts as inspiration is easier than thinking from scratch.

44:42 - Jorge Lewis 
using voice using unstructured voice notes is more fun to make than writing scripts I'm gonna say more enjoyable but then also um Using all my previous conversations and data is more efficient to produce new content than restate what I've already discussed.

45:33 - Jorge Lewis 
So I've got these two sides of every point. So that first one is more efficient. This one's more enjoyable. This one's ease is easier. And this last one is more enjoyable.

45:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So those are kind of the use cases I can imagine. This top one is the most business oriented where, or is the most indirect. I'm not thinking about making content when I have conversations. It's just, I'm already having conversations. Let's reuse that into, so extracting more value",7343c1b88dff669bbbdbe95e94bf4599,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200
37,5a970563a73deeb556be44feb1f2b00f," of every point. So that first one is more efficient. This one's more enjoyable. This one's ease is easier. And this last one is more enjoyable.

45:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So those are kind of the use cases I can imagine. This top one is the most business oriented where, or is the most indirect. I'm not thinking about making content when I have conversations. It's just, I'm already having conversations. Let's reuse that into, so extracting more value from conversations. That are already being done so this one's extracting more value from the conversations that are already being done make using unstructured voice notes is more enjoyable this one so what do you mean by unstructured voice notes so for example like What I want to do is open my phone and start a voice note and say, hey, I'm just going to ramble on about my opinions, my experience relating to SaaS and something. So for example, the three biggest mistakes I've seen in my past is that you non-technical founders will have a big vision, but then not be able to isolate one feature. Another one might be they're not niched enough. Etc. And I just rent on for a bit without having to worry about the structure of it being very organized.

47:28 - Biwas bhandari 
I can see this second point is more, I mean, like a practical, for example, in the midnight, I will be having so much ideas in my mind that I can just babble about it on the voice.

47:43 - Jorge Lewis 
It's easier to extract. To put down on paper ideas and thoughts.

47:53 - Jorge Lewis 
So this, so in the end, all of these are going to be content.

48:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So at the end, when you, your notes and ideas are, I mean, they're very nice to have, of course, but the end goal in this case is for content. So like, and then using others posts as inspiration is, What is that doing? That's kind of...

48:24 - Biwas bhandari 
I think we don't need that thought point. Using all those posts as interest. Um, no, no, no.

48:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I actually like about this one, so I think it was in, it was in the other. Oh, what did I click?

48:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, it was in the other fake jam. If you check out my screen share on the Google meet or if you just, um, So okay, other contents in the same niche. So what I mean by this is, if we were to take a look at an example of an implementation, I thought of, so I have a, you know, Tinder.

49:05 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

49:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I want.

49:10 - Jorge Lewis 
What I want to be able to do is it gives me content that from the internet and it says, Hey, it gives me the content and I can say, I like this. I don't like this. Or to give it to give more context, I can say, I agree with this part, but I don't agree with this part. So it's still me. I'm adding my opinion to it, but it's giving, it's giving me a foundation, something to go off of Like I can just build on top of that because if I agree with it, then there's no reason to create it from scratch. And I feel like if you do this a thousand times, that's one way you can capture your opinion on things in a very efficient manner.

49:51 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I got that.

49:54 - Jorge Lewis 
So maybe...

50:01 - Jorge Lewis 
So using others' posts is...

50:06 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I just described is not, is, is a great way to is, I guess it's easier than thinking from scratch or yeah. Cause content itself is, is so it should be unique to you, but if people share opinions, it's not like we're copying someone's post. It's like, all we're doing is going to copy two sentences from his whole post and copy another two sentences from another post. Not because we're just trying to copy it, but because we actually agree with it.

50:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

50:39 - Jorge Lewis 
It's like, um, it's like we're using GitHub code. You might reuse someone's little micro, like someone's project. That's a tiny part of your whole content because you like it and you think it's a good, a good package or something. You could have made your own unique one, but why not? Why just use that one?

51:01 - Biwas bhandari 
For example, if I'm making content on programming, I can see others first, take inspiration, and based on that, I can write my own.

51:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. And the important part is that you're actually not being a, you're not, what's the word when you're...

51:28 - Jorge Lewis 
There's a word for being too agreeable and programmers are often...

51:38 - Biwas bhandari 
I can't find it.

51:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So oftentimes when, for example, the primogen, you know the primogen?

51:49 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

51:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So he says a lot of things on his stuff, on his podcast. He reviews a lot of articles, by the way, which is like, if I",5a970563a73deeb556be44feb1f2b00f,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200
38,9f970a3e216e418ba7dfc69c0f0e1f21," too agreeable and programmers are often...

51:38 - Biwas bhandari 
I can't find it.

51:42 - Jorge Lewis 
So oftentimes when, for example, the primogen, you know the primogen?

51:49 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

51:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So he says a lot of things on his stuff, on his podcast. He reviews a lot of articles, by the way, which is like, if I watch that article, if I was a content writer, I could write a new article watching that for the Prime Agent, for example. So maybe this app, what it does is it facilitates, it records your screen And those reviews of articles and you just review it like that. Maybe that's how it gathers. I don't know. Or we can do the Tinder style where you're like, uh, yes, which part, uh, this part, I don't know.

52:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Or we can just paste the link of the article and say, okay, this is the article and here are my opinions and you can send it via voice input.

52:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, like there's a lot of UXs, user experience ways to do this that would make it more accessible. But the main idea is to use that as a foundation to create or to articulate your own opinions. To give you like a... It's easier to say what I believe when someone says their opinion on it. Like you can say you believe in... Are you... Okay, that was a bad example.

53:12 - Jorge Lewis 
If I hear you say that using types is better than not using types, it's a lot easier to respond to that than just thinking, okay, what's an idea? Oh, types. Yeah. Right. I think we got the point. So using other people's posts is easier to gather our own opinion.

53:40 - Jorge Lewis 
And then what else? Having conversations are more enjoyable. I will have more conversations.

54:02 - Jorge Lewis 
Writing content, i.e.

54:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Having a conversation is more fun, so I will write more content.

54:24 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, cool. Anyways, there's not much, um, there's no format to this. Like all of these are pretty random, like what's on the left and right side, but I think it's more important to just kind of get those thoughts on paper first. And then we can use that to write something more well formatted afterwards. Okay. This misalignment is bothering me. Why is that?

54:46 - Jorge Lewis 
There we go.

54:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, cool.

54:51 - Jorge Lewis 
And then, this Google Meet was supposed to be just a vision and workshop mission. A vision and mission workshop, but we ended up just going through a rabbit hole of what this project actually is. Which is the entire point of this workshop, so I guess it illustrates that. Maybe Jonas is free now at this point. Okay, so using all that.

55:18 - Biwas bhandari 
So what's the mission now?

55:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, what is the new mission?

55:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's take some time and go and go iterate. So let's, I'm going to go into my own corner and just think about it for a second and write it down.

55:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Hmm.

56:33 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, I got something out, I think. I'll be in the restroom real quick.

57:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Oops.

57:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

58:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you finished your thing?

58:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I finished mine.

59:09 - Jorge Lewis 
Changing your thoughts, conversations into experiences, into content by extracting relevant into them.

59:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Ah.

59:41 - Biwas bhandari 
But if we look at mine, the target audience will not only be content creators and entrepreneurs, but everybody, because everybody had thoughts and experiences which they want to share to others.

1:00:12 - Biwas bhandari 
It is the friction involved in content creation by making it more human.

1:00:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Mine one is more misaligned with the original.

1:00:40 - Jorge Lewis 
It's more what? More misaligned with the from the original mission so make content creation out of ideation faster and require less mental effort technically what we've described does that that's the But I think we can narrow it down more precisely into what we're doing. All of these above that we list is experiences. I think we can group them into just the term experiences.

1:01:30 - Jorge Lewis 
To allow experiences to be used for content writing.

1:01:38 - Jorge Lewis 
To allow experiences to be used for content writing.

1:01:46 - Jorge Lewis 
To create content. Allow previous experiences to be used. So our mission is to allow previous experiences to be used to create content.

1:02:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So we went from making the content creation easier to enjoyable and it's Allowing previous experiences to be used to make content is making it faster and require less mental effort. It's like, I don't know, it's the same. I think we can just keep these both. We'll have all of this here. We don't have to come to a conclusion right now. I think we're pretty aligned on kind of the direction",9f970a3e216e418ba7dfc69c0f0e1f21,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200

1:02:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So we went from making the content creation easier to enjoyable and it's Allowing previous experiences to be used to make content is making it faster and require less mental effort. It's like, I don't know, it's the same. I think we can just keep these both. We'll have all of this here. We don't have to come to a conclusion right now. I think we're pretty aligned on kind of the direction, but the line that we go in, it can be defined later, maybe with Jonas' help.

1:03:05 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Content can be made not only through previous experiences to only maybe we can create content about anything, not only previous experiences.

1:03:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Like also like if we use, Hmm, I think, I think the mission, I think this mission makes sense, but I think what we change is the vision. Maybe.

1:03:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:03:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's, um, Let me see. This is accurate. This is what the platform should be doing. It should create content if it were me. Not only the style, this is the vision, the means, how we get there. These are what I want to do to get there. I want to use conversations. I want to use my unstructured voice notes. I want to use other people's posts as inspirations. I want to use my, yeah.

1:04:02 - Biwas bhandari 
But initially we can, uh, make the app that can just, uh, create a content based on your, um, the one that was initially, uh, what do you call it? Proposed or something like that.

1:04:22 - Biwas bhandari 
So you want to write a content, but you are just, uh, and you have the idea too, but you are just not able to start writing it in a copy and all that. So for that, uh, our AI chat bot can help you. Uh, visualize, uh, not visualize. How do you call it? Give a certain context or ideas or just write the content.

1:04:54 - Jorge Lewis 
I think so for me, at least I don't think the ideas are too hard right now. Ideas become hard or no, no, no. In every, so in every day, every day I have a lot of conversations and I'm quite sure that I don't need to create new ideas to write about. I can use those conversations to make ideas. Like I say, Hey, are there any types of like, are there any cool posts I can make from today's news?

1:05:23 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

1:05:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. That can be great.

1:05:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So that instead of when you're writing a voice memo, instead of thinking, oh, this is going to be making a video. You're just talking like in general, like you can go from talking about the problems SAS founders make to, um, to ugly code. And then you can go to architectural problems. And in the end, it won't matter because all you're going to do is insert this into, um, the AI chatbot and he'll use it when relevant. So like, um, so. Yeah, okay, cool. We can touch on this. Hopefully Jonas can watch all this and see us going in circles and maybe help us figure out where we want to go. Because usually how this works is there's one facilitator, the project owner, and then the stakeholders, so like, and the developers, I guess. So it'd be helpful if, because I'm also, I'm facilitating, developing, and the owner. So I don't know if that's helpful or not. I don't think that's helpful.

1:06:30 - Jorge Lewis 
And Jonas has watched quite a lot of, he's educated quite a lot on this. I've just done this workshop once with Jonas and here I am trying to do one. All right. Well, I guess let's just leave it at there. We can go into the road. I don't know. Let's go into the roadmap maybe.

1:07:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me, uh oh. Are we in the wrong file again?

1:07:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Not the right one. Let me rename it. I think I'm just gonna copy all of this and paste it into the other file and just use a different page because going through, going between different files is really inefficient.

1:07:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. All right.

1:07:40 - Jorge Lewis 
So I pasted it there.

1:07:41 - Biwas bhandari 
Word bet.

1:08:11 - Jorge Lewis 
So we have the conception, and then the vision and mission, and then the planning.

1:08:18 - Jorge Lewis 
So the planning will define the backlog pretty much, the features we're going to build.

1:08:31 - Jorge Lewis 
And which features we want to build first, and when, and all that. So, very tiring, huh?

1:08:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So, let's see. Also, wait.

1:08:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Will requested access to something.

And which features we want to build first, and when, and all that. So, very tiring, huh?

1:08:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So, let's see. Also, wait.

1:08:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Will requested access to something.

1:09:28 - Jorge Lewis 
So we want to get into the roadmap and kind of the features. So I'm going to borrow this from here. And if you go to the planning page, are you following along, by the way?

1:09:37 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm just watching it in this screen.

1:09:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I think the only feature we're building is the chatbot.

1:10:09 - Jorge Lewis 
On the front end, we just need a chatbot. And that chatbot's going to need to have all the capabilities.

1:10:19 - Jorge Lewis 
I'm just kind of going off of nothing here. So we have the chatbot.

1:10:27 - Jorge Lewis 
And this guy needs...

1:10:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's start with just trick like or actually just two And then Needs a good strategy to write good content So the strategy to write good content is gonna be the hardest part because hmm And it's going to require a lot of figuring out the best way to make.

1:11:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Because I think the hard part about this. Yeah. I mean, the only the the unique value proposition of this is that we can convert anything into content.

1:11:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Like any text in any conversation or transcript or meeting, anything like that, we can convert into content.

1:11:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Mm hmm.

1:11:35 - Jorge Lewis 
And to do that, we need a system that's really good at that. And how can we tell this bot to make good content if we don't know how to make good content ourselves? So we have a lot of homework to do, and we have to figure out how to make good content.

1:11:53 - Jorge Lewis 
There's actually one guy I know. Oh, this is pretty funny. What's his name?

1:12:01 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, luckily me. This guy.

1:12:05 - Biwas bhandari 
No.

1:12:07 - Jorge Lewis 
I think he does, um, like he teaches people how to do content creation. Okay.

1:12:15 - Jorge Lewis 
It doesn't seem like it.

1:12:23 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, but what we have to do is a lot of research and figuring out how to make, we need to figure out the graph we want to use, the structure, the cognitive architecture we want to use, and then That's one thing that's for the technical implementation and then also how to make good content. So how can we teach this chatbot to make good content?

1:12:52 - Biwas bhandari 
So one part is we need to, okay, we ourselves need to know how to make a good content at first, or we need to just research a bit on that. And for the technical part of the chatbot.

1:13:09 - Jorge Lewis 
So the chatbot has access to the files, but it's not using the files. It's using a knowledge, like I think the knowledge graph is the way to go for this.

1:13:31 - Jorge Lewis 
You know knowledge graphs, right?

1:13:32 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

1:13:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

1:13:37 - Jorge Lewis 
So just figuring out how do we make this chatbot do this well. And we can plan this all we want. The best way to go about it is probably to make an MVP in like three hours and see how how like a just normal chatbot tries to make content from a transcript. So I think the first step, like for me, my intuition just tells me, okay, let's create a knowledge graph from a bunch of transcripts. So I'm going to take all my, and I want to use existing data so that it just saves time. So I'm going to take all these reports, print out the transcripts, upload it to Superbit, or no, that's already over-complicating it. Just use those text files locally. Yeah.

1:14:27 - Biwas bhandari 
And then we can just pass it. These are the con. Yeah. Pass it as a input instead of saving it in.

1:14:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Take out, um, check out graph reg. This start the, this is what we'll be using to, to make this happen. At first it uses, um, it uses an LLM to make a graph, a graph like this. Then these are the steps of indexing it. And then at the end, it queries it using an LLM as well. So for vector databases, we have a model that creates the vector database. It decides, it knows what words are to place where in the vector space. For this one, it knows where to place things relative to other things. That's all these steps. So what we can do is play around and this is why I'm doing it in Python for one one reason is because Everything is in Python like this is in Python. So, okay One warning one warning for you specifically. Yeah is Warning graph reg indexing can be expensive. I looking into this and implementing it. So my intuition is just telling me, okay",e069670214e07bcddb9dfe21b4f0e8a2,['4f37fe7434922d5d4a9c395a61536e93'],1200

So, okay One warning one warning for you specifically. Yeah is Warning graph reg indexing can be expensive. I looking into this and implementing it. So my intuition is just telling me, okay, I'm gonna start, I'm gonna make a knowledge graph from all the transcripts I have, and then I'm going to just try from there to just out of the box, see if the knowledge graph can make some content, like anything. If it does an okay job of that, I'll be like, okay, this is easier than I thought. If it doesn't, that's what I'm expecting, then I'll have to look at things like, a flow of, okay, first we're going to gather all the topics in the idea of this, all the pieces of content, or we'll create a topic and then sub topics and then everything like that. And then we gather content from there. So like, just figure out the flow.

1:16:28 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. For me personally, I don't know what values to content provide. So I need to look on that too.

1:16:35 - Jorge Lewis 
What values?

1:16:36 - Biwas bhandari 
What are the benefits of content writing?

1:16:40 - Jorge Lewis 
What do you mean benefits?

1:16:42 - Biwas bhandari 
I mean, uh, what good kind of content, um, I mean, I don't know. Okay. I mean, I don't know what good values to content writing provides personally.

1:16:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, you mean like you don't know what good content is, you mean, or no, no, no.

1:17:01 - Biwas bhandari 
What, what is the benefit of writing content?

1:17:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I mean the benefit. How is that important?

1:17:14 - Biwas bhandari 
I personally need to know, I think maybe in order to create this app, I need to do some research on content writing and all that, since I personally have no knowledge on all these things.

1:17:26 - Jorge Lewis 
But you want to write, you write blog articles, right? You like that?

1:17:31 - Biwas bhandari 
No.

1:17:36 - Biwas bhandari 
I've written one too. But I've heard every developer saying every developer should write articles and blogs.

1:17:44 - Jorge Lewis 
But do you enjoy it?

1:17:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

1:17:50 - Biwas bhandari 
I like making videos instead of writing blogs.

1:17:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, that's already the reason, because you enjoy it. For most content, it depends what you're doing it for. For Startino, there's a couple reasons. First one is because it can attract clients. It shows our expertise. It shows we have an online presence and we're real people. Another reason is because I would enjoy I know the team would enjoy making those videos, like a competition of our team making the best chess or something. I would enjoy making that and I know other team members would enjoy it.

1:18:26 - Jorge Lewis 
It also might be a way to recruit talent. The reasons I think are kind of, they depend on you.

1:18:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Like, why would you write content? I don't know. It really depends on you. For me, for my personal channel, for example, I like doing that because I get to reflect on what I respect, reflect on my life. I've learned, but also because I can help other people that are in similar situations. And also because I know in the longterm, having a personal brand is very powerful.

1:19:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

1:19:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Alright, Quen's asking me to call, but I need to go use the restroom and I gotta go to Jiu-Jitsu.

1:19:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I think we can end this session for today. Yeah, so...

1:19:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you hopping on tonight?

1:19:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I'll hop on.

1:19:34 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, um, I'll I'll try to hop on since I'm excited. I might have the motivation But yeah, I'm excited about this Hopefully, it's not too hard but like for me I'm gonna be really annoyed because it's not gonna be perfect because yeah, he sucks at making content I hate reading chativity content every time I'm on LinkedIn. I read chativity content.

1:19:59 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm just So annoying Yeah, if I go faster than you, I'll do some research on this topic.

Yeah, I started ninth grade, like, coding, and then me and Jorge were, like, doing game development and more younger people projects than what we are currently, and now we're trying to make money. With our experience, that's from when I was 18, I got a job as a software engineering in a Norwegian consultancy, worked on bank applications, and also, what was it? Some internal software used by the oil and gas industry in Norway.

9:44 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

9:47 - Jonas Lindberg 
Let's not confuse the fact that I'm younger than you guys and anything else.

9:58 - Jonas Lindberg 
Anyways, yeah, let's get back to it.

9:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yeah, let's get back to diagramming.

10:02 - Jonas Lindberg 
I'll share my screen just so we can be on one thing.

10:14 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, actually, before we go into the graphs...

10:20 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So before we go into the graphs, I want to...

10:26 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So before we go into the graphs since that's more flexible I kind of want to talk about the current state of the project and what's the plan so currently we have We were in the middle of migrating, you guys probably know this part already, we were migrating from Python to TypeScript, we were in the middle, we set everything, we set the foundations up, we connected to the database, connected it to the front end with just a simple one function, and we were in the process of making it actually work with LandGraph. Currently, right now, the biggest problem we're facing, other than just setting up the actual graph, is passing the message history to the chat. So I think I'm sharing my screen. So when we're calling a stream and we initialize it with this list of messages, the problem is that it's not somehow getting all the messages. So that's the current bug we're facing.

11:27 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Maybe you guys have experience with this. I don't know. I want to say that in my testing, I noticed that passing messages worked.

11:35 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
But if I created messages manually, So when this was just like a list of messages it works Okay, like it multiple Yeah, I think maybe just better use a normal list like like before That didn't work either. I think it's the parsing from the database to messages that doesn't work. But that's what I was testing before we got in this meeting. I think I was at the edge of maybe solving it, I don't know.

12:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, so we'll take a look at that later. But that's where we're currently at. And in terms of where we need to be, where we need to be is by Wednesday, end of day Wednesday, we need to have the the project deployed and the client can test it, Kuin. Kuin is his name, I'm gonna use his name, so that Kuin can test it. The capabilities you need to be able to do is to just have a conversation with the bot, so making it so that it can have a conversation like we discussed, like the example I sent and like the one we had today. So, yeah.

So, yeah.

13:02 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So in terms of what the plan is, who's going to do what, we can go over it maybe now? So since you two are going to be paired together, it'll be kind of up to you guys to decide if we have maybe two prototypes we want to test, you guys can go into each one and test those out, or however you guys want to do it, that's up to you guys.

13:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Jonas, do you want to tackle the message bug, or do you want to hand it? Do you want to see if they can take it on?

13:38 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I want to tackle it for at least this day. But if I don't solve it today, I will probably have to go.

13:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
OK.

13:47 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So today, Jonas will work on that little bug that I mentioned. If he's not able to do it, then we'll pass it to you guys, since you guys are probably more experienced with LandGraph.

13:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, cool.

13:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so yes, let's get it to the graph. Who would like to go first? So actually, I think Jonas should go first, since his one, our ones are, what the

14:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
I can't zoom out.

14:13 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Oh, that's the max. I guess we'll go through Jonas's graph first, since his one is just the conversation, not the actual line graph. So yeah, Jonas, you go ahead, I'll mute.

14:30 - Jonas Lindberg 
So yeah, this diagram is more to specify what it should be capable of It doesn't really go into the technicals of how things should be pushed to the DB and how things should be retrieved properly, because I think that's more of a technical issue that can be solved no matter how the conversation goes out. But this is basically the parts of the conversation where someone will be sending a message that will be visible to the user.

14:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
I have top left here. It's the user starting the check-in. When the user starts the check-in, it'll always go to the collector first. And the collector will then request something from the user. For example, how far have you walked today? Then afterwards, hopefully the user gives their request of information. If they reject, or if they say, I don't know, or something like that, it'll probably go back to the collector again for the collector to be like, OK, can you estimate? Or OK, something like that.

15:37 - Jonas Lindberg 
And also, let's say the user gives a complicated answer. Maybe the user says, I walked around my block. Then the collector's job is to say, okay, well, how far was that? And maybe kind of tease and say, the average block is maybe 1KM. Would you say that's accurate? So that's his job. Yeah. Okay.

15:59 - Jonas Lindberg 
Just extract the information from the user.

16:04 - Jonas Lindberg 
More point, yeah. When the information is extracted from the user, And the user, for the first time in this loop, goes to the coach. It always goes through the analyst, which analyzes the data, as well as pointing out if any previous data is relevant. So the analyst's job can be to detect long-term patterns and more complicated stuff than just the coach acting on the data now. And the analyst will pass that to the coach. So, of course, then the coach is on the info, and afterwards it goes back to the user. Now, during the check-in, as I've written here, after the coach has spoken, we need to determine if it should go back to the collector to go on to the next item. Basically, if the user just says, OK, sure, that's fine, then it will go back to the collector, and the collector will ask for more information. Or if the user says something like, why should I do that? I don't understand. I think I'm doing an OK pace now. I don't want to increase it. If it says something like that, Then it should go to the coach again so that the coach can comment on what the user said without it going to the collector and the collector requesting information for it, because that's not always going to fit in. Sometimes it needs to be like a back and forth. Why would I do that? Because it's good for you. Why is it good for me? Because it is. And then finally, when they agree, the discussion with the coach, it goes back to the collector again to move on to the next item. At which point, the loop restarts with the user giving the information. Or if they don't, it goes back to the collector, tries to get the information. Afterwards, the analyst analyzes it, points out things for the",9fd8410d0a298646c2b6ab4f55237e50,['51d15be65386037c8039aec14b5b0933'],1200

And then finally, when they agree, the discussion with the coach, it goes back to the collector again to move on to the next item. At which point, the loop restarts with the user giving the information. Or if they don't, it goes back to the collector, tries to get the information. Afterwards, the analyst analyzes it, points out things for the coach to coach on. And then onto the coach, the loop continues until the coaching is completely done.

17:56 - Jonas Lindberg 
Any questions?

18:05 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nah, I got it.

18:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Nah, seems pretty straight forward.

18:08 - Jonas Lindberg 
Yep, sounds good.

18:11 - Jonas Lindberg 
Thank you.

18:13 - Jonas Lindberg 
Can we take it to the next Skylar?

18:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
That sounds more logical than mine.

18:17 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, so what's what?

18:23 - Jonas Lindberg 
Are these old now?

18:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

18:25 - Jonas Lindberg 
Okay, how about we move that somewhere else. So, who's this one that I'm on?

18:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
What I was thinking was also similar to Jonas, but he drew a better graph than me with all the nodes. What I was thinking was the same, is that the user can have two edges, but whenever the user checks in, it will always go to the check-in node. And this this will call the previous data from the data and then it will pass to the analyst and it will always go from the analyst to the coach whenever it goes from the check-in node so the analyst analyzes the past data and this is The analyst will analyze the past data and the today's data from the check-in and it will pass on to the coach and then the coach can decide to give advice and once it has given advice, the user can also obviously like Yona said, user can counter and coach can give follow-ups or he can counter back and when the user feels satisfied he can end and if he asks another question it will go again back to a check-in and so yeah was I able to make it clear or coach is coached on it, and it's done.

20:28 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
How do we depict in this graph that we're going to the next item? Because we need to have it so that the check, I mean, the coach can also be responsible. But I think it would be more reasonable if the check-in node is responsible for making sure the, or asking for more data.

20:49 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, that's an additional thing which you almost mentioned. His graph is more logical. At the time of check-in, if we ask more data, so we'll have more user input on what he did.

21:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
So...

21:08 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Would it make more sense if we did...

21:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Sorry for messing up your graph here, but...

21:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hold Alt to...

21:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, there we go.

21:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So instead this is, um, so would this, would this still kind of make sense for your, for your idea?

21:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:50 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

21:50 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And then, and then it's the supervisor's job to determine is the user passing new data that the check-in node should handle, or is the user responding to a coach's message?

22:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

22:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
So if the user is countering the coach, then the supervisor knows that I have to call the coach next, but if the user is passing on new data or the user is setting new goals, then it will pass into the check-in.

22:23 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And then this line here, I don't know if you can see this one. Is this still relevant?

22:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because we added the supervisor, this is not relevant. Yeah.

22:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So then, so when the check-in node gets new data, and he updates the database, he'll tell the analyst, the analyst will tell the coach, and then the coach will, okay, cool, nice. Okay, makes sense.

22:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
And any other questions, guys?

22:49 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
One, is the check-in node basically the interaction between the user and the collector, or the collector tries to get information out of the user?

22:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
I can't hear you. Oh.

23:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is the check-in node basically the collector and the user working together to get the data out of the user? So, yeah. Yeah.

23:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

23:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. The check-in is the collector. I just wrote a check-in because I wanted for it to",d9de322a3fcdc18ff29b4406fd620205,['51d15be65386037c8039aec14b5b0933'],1200
47,ffe5faf6443e7a344a0750827f7c65c8," to get information out of the user?

22:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
I can't hear you. Oh.

23:06 - Jonas Lindberg 
Is the check-in node basically the collector and the user working together to get the data out of the user? So, yeah. Yeah.

23:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

23:17 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah. The check-in is the collector. I just wrote a check-in because I wanted for it to be clear to me that whenever the user enters new data, it will go to the check-in.

23:30 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Okay.

23:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

23:36 - Jonas Lindberg 
Sounds good.

23:38 - Unidentified Speaker 
All right.

23:39 - Jonas Lindberg 
Um, he was, yeah.

23:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay.

23:56 - Biwas bhandari 
so basically a user will input something and this chat prompt will decide either it should go to collector or not we can give it logic like if the user checks in then call this function otherwise just chat with the coach and if it chats with the coach it will update in the collector and then it will again return to the user And it's basically similar users added their supervisor instead of that prompt.

24:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, it looks, I think it's identical to, it's a little bit different, but I noticed a mistake on Xinmei's one that I forgot to do was that the coach should actually be returning to the user. Same for the collector. No point going back to the supervisor.

24:55 - Biwas bhandari 
Instead of supervisor, we can just train, give a logic to the chat prompt. It will be easier.

25:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, and then the key feature, the key difference I see is that the coach is connected to the data analyst.

25:10 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yep. Do you wanna go through that?

25:15 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, so in the, yes, when a user will just check in, it will pass it to the collector. And the collector again pass it to the coach and it will pass it, not coach. The collector will pass it to the data analyst.

25:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
So this makes more sense.

25:42 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
The arrows, you guys, your graphs are so big that I can't see the arrows.

25:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
Well, yep.

25:51 - Biwas bhandari 
The user will input something and this chat prompt will determine either is the user just checked in or just wants to chat with the coach. And if it wants to check in, it will pass it to the collector and the collector will pass it to the data analyst and the coach and coach will return it to the user.

26:11 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. It's good.

26:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yes.

26:12 - Biwas bhandari 
Well, I think that's good.

26:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
Edge from coach to collector.

26:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

26:34 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I was about to ask that.

26:45 - Biwas bhandari 
Did I make it clear or is there any questions? This one.

26:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
What does the edge between coach and collector represent? Or when does it get triggered?

26:57 - Biwas bhandari 
When the user will ask, like you said, why should I do it? How should I do it? And it will update to the collector. No, no. Coach to collector, bro.

27:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Huh?

27:08 - Chinmay Pandya 
Coach to collector.

27:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Coach to collector?

27:12 - Biwas bhandari 
Why would it go to coach to collector?

27:14 - Chinmay Pandya 
You don't have to put it in the database.

27:19 - Biwas bhandari 
I think the conversation between user and coach should also be stored. That's why.

27:27 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So, so this, so this one is to, okay.

27:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

27:35 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but we, I think we can remove the chat prompt nodes and basically just connect coach and collector directly to the user. And that will be basically why you, yeah.

27:57 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Like that. And keep the user one? Like the user to collector, that arrow?

28:08 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, that's when the user is starting to check in, it'll go to the collector. Same in my graph, like when the user is starting to check.

28:17 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, conditionals are dotted. OK. So, I mean, just for in terms of the actual line graph, there needs to be a supervisor node to determine who to go to. The user can't, so let me just add that.

",ffe5faf6443e7a344a0750827f7c65c8,['51d15be65386037c8039aec14b5b0933'],1200
48,b932b1e94a8b6740ac97cda72e5d7e2c,"Yeah, that's when the user is starting to check in, it'll go to the collector. Same in my graph, like when the user is starting to check.

28:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Well, okay, so.

28:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
The collector has to be able to speak with the user to get back and forth.

28:56 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so it's funny we've we've gone we've I think this is now the actual exact same as yeah, it's the exact same as she lies away No It's the, uh, no, no, the graph is, uh, wait, what is one coach to, okay. Instead of, so there's one.

29:35 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello?

29:36 - Chinmay Pandya 
In his graph, it's like it will move to coach and the coach will request analysis from the analyst in mind at the time of checking, it will move always to the analyst then to the coach.

29:49 - Unidentified Speaker 
I see. Yeah, yeah.

29:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, cool. Let's go through my one and then we can kind of come to a conclusion.

29:57 - Chinmay Pandya 
So you can decide routing without a supervisor.

30:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, but I, yeah, it's a bit of a design choice. It's like, do you want to delegate the task to a language model to determine from the conversation or do we want to trust the other agents to put a text in their answer?

30:18 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so if we do not want to use a supervisor agent node, then we can use the router logic, which sits between the edges. Sorry, say it again.

30:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
For questions where it's like, do we want to delegate this test to a model or to something like that, I think diagram both of them, just so we have both diagrams. And then in the future, we can try both and see which works best.

30:57 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah.

30:58 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
When it's things that we don't know for sure, we're better off trying than trying to be like, hmm. I mean, I guess sometimes you can think it through, though.

31:05 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:05 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I think just trying is the most reliable way to get it. And sometimes you think things through, and then you leave. Yeah. Yeah.

31:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Cool.

31:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so I'll go through my one. Did you guys hear all that by the way?

31:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hello.

31:28 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah. Did you guys hear the, what Jonas was saying?

31:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, we couldn't hear what he said. Not quite clearly.

31:36 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

31:37 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Um, he said that's when we have things like that, we don't know for sure. It's better to just try them out in the code and see which one actually performs better. Because sometimes through discussion, it's not enough to actually get a real world understanding of it.

31:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

31:55 - Chinmay Pandya 
If it works or not, unless we. Language models are so unpredictable.

31:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And then also when you're trying to code it in that process, you understand like new under the table, like problems and stuff. Yeah. Um, okay. So I'll go through mine and then we can kind of conclude. So. Let me try to remember, what's the, why I have two?

32:19 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

32:25 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, the bottom one is better. The bottom one's better. I'll explain the top one after, but just the bottom one's better. So first of all, we start with user, and the concept of this is where the collector will receive every message first, And if the message is related to the collector's task, so for example, if the user is passing the message, or if the user says, let's check in, or if the user says, dude, I'm done with my check in, you're so boring, let's stop the check in any of those things, the collector will call his tools and complete those actions. But if the user is not invoking is not like trying to invoke one of those tools, the collector without responding or without doing any actions, Or maybe he will do some actions. We'll pass it to the coach, and the coach will make a response. So for example, if the user",b932b1e94a8b6740ac97cda72e5d7e2c,['51d15be65386037c8039aec14b5b0933'],1200
49,e8ff5373633411e525c55cc2e0b9a804," the user says, dude, I'm done with my check in, you're so boring, let's stop the check in any of those things, the collector will call his tools and complete those actions. But if the user is not invoking is not like trying to invoke one of those tools, the collector without responding or without doing any actions, Or maybe he will do some actions. We'll pass it to the coach, and the coach will make a response. So for example, if the user says, let's check in, the collector will call his tool that says start check-in, and he'll pass it to coach. Or the collector will respond and gather the data. As soon as the data is collected, it'll go to coach. The coach will provide some feedback. If the user is responding to that feedback, it'll go to the collector first. The collector will see, will tell it, or will teach it how to understand when it's responding to the coach, and it'll hand it off to the coach directly. So it's kind of being in the middle of a supervisor, but also just telling it, hey, if this is applicable to you, do something. If it's not, just hand it off to the coach, which is always a direct line. So it'll always pass it to the coach. Although this is not the case, actually. Sometimes when the user says, let's check in, the collector should say, OK, he should prompt the user to ask or give information. There's no one else in.

34:11 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
My speaker's not loud enough.

34:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
It isn't.

34:16 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Mine is. Mine isn't.

34:18 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I can show you. You can just get the Chrome extension. My speakers like start buzzing.

34:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Is yours not?

34:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
No. So for the collector, if the collector calls new or update check-in, so as in the user gives new data, he'll pass it to the analyst and the analyst will then go to the coach. But if it's something like, if he's starting a check-in or if he's ending a check-in, it'll most likely go to the coach.

34:55 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Does that make sense or can I have some questions?

35:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so who will ask the follow-ups?

35:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry?

35:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
Who will ask the follow-ups or if let's say the user has checked in, so the collector has either two choices, either go to the coach, not call any tools, or either call his tools to get previous data. But what if you want to have a conversation between collector and user to get more data before it passes to the coach?

35:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, so then if the data has not, so usually this edge will only be triggered when updates check, when update check-in is called, usually. I think there's probably some more nuanced cases.

35:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So for example, the user says, I walked around the block, my house's block, and the collector will see that and say, okay, that's not enough information for me to update the database. So let me go back to the user and ask for more information or try to pry it out. Otherwise, if we know we have the information we need, then we're going to pass it to the coach. Not the analyst. Or then the analyst first and then the coach. But when would this line ever go? This line would go when it's not new data. So if it's, if the user is responding to a coach, so like, let's say the coach says you should walk five, five KM instead of one, by the way, I don't know why we're using miles. So everyone, like literally everyone in the, in this entire project uses KM. So you guys use KM, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Even the client uses it.

36:38 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Wouldn't that go use for coach then? Why pass it to collector just for the collector to go? I don't need to do anything to this.

36:45 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
No, because then otherwise we'd need a router every single time and it would be actually cost more than a collector itself.

36:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

36:52 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
So it's basically if we want to leave it like the responsibility to the collector. Yeah.

36:56 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So it's just saying collector may or may not do anything, but making a route to collector by default solves the problem of introducing an extra supervisor.

37:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Could you add the comment on that line instead of just update check-in, just no new relevant info, or just the coach is having a conversation, the collector does nothing.

37:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, just default, I think.

37:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
The collector does nothing. Yeah, collector does nothing.

37:",e8ff5373633411e525c55cc2e0b9a804,['51d15be65386037c8039aec14b5b0933'],1200
50,525389164d86035a6bb1eceda2baec21," an extra supervisor.

37:03 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Could you add the comment on that line instead of just update check-in, just no new relevant info, or just the coach is having a conversation, the collector does nothing.

37:12 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, just default, I think.

37:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
The collector does nothing. Yeah, collector does nothing.

37:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
So whenever the user enters a prompt or check-in, and if the data is not enough, then will the collector add that to the database first or ask more questions?

37:33 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry, just repeat that.

37:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
If the user enters something which is not enough, not enough to analyze, like you said, he walked, he just walked around and if the collector wants to know more data before he passes to the analyzer, then will he update the database, the pieces of information he gets when he gets those pieces, or will he update the information once he gets enough pieces?

38:04 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
He, he has to do it when he gets enough pieces because in the data, this is a, oh, this is the wrong project.

38:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah.

38:13 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Um, so, so in the database, there's columns specifically for the items. So things like, um, the NKM, how far has the user walked? So if the user has given anything other than that, the collector needs the number of kilometers the user has walked. Um, so if the user says I walked around.

38:34 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I walked around a football pitch three times. The collector could interpret this and say, okay, so, or if the user says something like that, then the collector, if he's very certain that the distance of a football pitch, then he can do it.

38:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

38:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
So if you add a node in between, which has the function to decide whether the information is enough or not. And then when the information is enough, then it will pass to the collector. So the collector won't have to decide additional logic to maintain whether the information is enough or not. Collector can just have two functions, whether call from the database or pass it to the coach.

39:32 - Chinmay Pandya 
Right now, collector has three logics. Call from the database, pass it to the coach, or check whether data is enough or not. So if the data is not enough, we can add another node which decides if the data is enough or not before passing it to the collector.

39:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, I see. I think both will work. Your one is kind of more robust. I'm trying to think of any downsides of introducing an extra node in the middle here.

40:09 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
I haven't heard any of the context, but I don't think we should avoid introducing nodes.

40:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
There is actually a problem, though, with speed, with time. Because once we introduce too many nodes, the duration for a response becomes actually unbearable.

40:26 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
We can improve that with faster models, of course, but we're trying to keep, like, ideally, it's just not going through a lot of nodes.

40:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
What about, like, limited loop structures, like the one I created, where it's, like, they take part in one part of the loop, then jump to another part of the loop, then jump? Like, if we straight up implemented my whole flowchart as a graph, how would that work?

40:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Because usually then it's only going for like two months at a time.

40:51 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So in my experience, what I made with the Python graph, actually, the collector was doing what I... My graph here is actually what was the case before, except the analysis is a little bit different. The collector in my previous one was doing the three logics. So understanding if we have enough info, passing it to the coach or updating the database.

41:15 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
And it was able to do it quite accurately as well. It was like, for example, if I said I walked to cam and then another message later on, I said, Oh, actually I walked an additional eight, then it was able to update it accordingly. Um, I didn't do rigorous testing. So, so maybe, but I think to start off, we can start with this. And then if we know if in our testing, we figure out, okay, this, this guy's pretty inaccurate when we try to like, test its limits in terms of like making more complicated answers, then we can introduce one. Does that work or do you think otherwise?

41:47 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I think we should try with a simpler model first.

41:53 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so from all of these, what can we take from all of them? Which one do we like best?

42:00 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Well, not Jonas's, sorry, your one said a useful diagram, but not a graph, not the line graph.

42:06 - Unidentified Speaker 
We'll need to save this.

42:11 - Unidentified Speaker 
Bro, the text is too small.

42:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I'll save it later. So which one do you like best?

42:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
Mine has four nodes, and yours has three. So right now, I would like to test with three nodes, if it works.

42:38 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
These two are just, yeah, these are the same, right?

42:42 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Except the line that goes between the coach and collector, but I don't- I don't think that's really relevant. Yeah, because both of them have a router, I don't think. BWAS.

42:51 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, they're the same.

42:54 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so BWAS, what do you think of this one, starting with this one then?

43:18 - Biwas bhandari 
I work 10 kilometers and today I work 20 kilometers.

43:22 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, yeah.

43:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Yeah, one thing we need to consider is are things like when the user does things like that when he says 2 KM and then 5 KM like we need to make sure we have a system where it updates the database accurately because for example it might try to do it might update the database first with 2 KM and then it does another call with 5 KM but really it should be doing the second calls should be for 7

43:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
so we need to make sure that's that's in place the database updated before every preceding check-in sorry like if the user checks in another five kilometers like you said if he checks in with another five kilometers so if we have the two kilometers updated and we can calculate that the entire day he already had two kilometers and then he went out and did five again yeah there's there's two options like one of them is just trust that the

44:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
llm will see the conversation history, which in the past, through my experimentation, it was able to do that. It never failed. But the other option is to every database update is the sum. So it just adds them together. I think letting the LLM decide is better, because if it's the sum, we're relying a lot more on conditional, like hard-coded things than the LLM. The LLM will just know, OK, no info, let's update it.

44:51 - Chinmay Pandya 
We just need to tell LLM to recognize all of the activities of today. So he'll sum it up himself. Yeah.

45:00 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Maybe, maybe later down the road, if we noticed the, the collector is, is it sucks at trying to figure out like multiple data points and adding them together, we can make a small little graph down here to help add an extra LLM saying summarize or like extract the, the data points for this in this category.

45:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Something like that.

45:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
It's the thing about the nice thing.

45:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Sorry.

45:25 - Chinmay Pandya 
I was thinking of a fourth node because if the collector has too many responsibilities, it might not work.

45:32 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:33 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So, so we'll have to test around. Um, that's a nice thing about this graphs. It's really easy to test. You just change the prompts and add some edges. Yeah.

45:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
We just have to add a node and we have to just transfer the tools.

45:46 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

45:46 - Chinmay Pandya 
We have to transfer from coach, from collector to the support. Yeah.

45:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool.

45:54 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So in terms of the plan then, I'll leave Chinmay and D.Wes to discuss what you guys are going to try to do. Jonas is going to continue on the messages thing. I won't be on the project right now. I'll let you guys work.

46:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, cool.

46:22 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so I think tomorrow, sometime around midday, we can check in all together and see how things are going and how we can delegate a little bit better.

46:29 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also, there's some issue with the check-in, the database check-in.

46:39 - Biwas bhandari 
What's wrong with it?

46:41 - Chinmay Pandya 
Like we have three check-ins, an update check-in, a create check-in, and get today's check-in, right?

46:54 - Chinmay Pandya 
Hello.

46:55 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah. Yeah.

46:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
So, uh, the code as it was written for create check-in, it will always, it should return the latest inserted node or the data, but it always returns the data as null.

47:18 - Unidentified Speaker 
I see. So is that.

47:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
No, wait. I'll present my screen and show you.

47:34 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah.

47:35 - Chinmay Pandya 
So here.

47:37 - Chinmay Pandya 
You see this?

47:39 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

47:40 - Chinmay Pandya 
This is always not.

47:44 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, so whenever you're trying to create a check-in, it will not return you the latest check-in which was created. And that's why the data is always null. And in the case of error, we pass in an object where data is null and error. So here, this was the original code.

48:04 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
So here we try to return something, but this will always be null. So this, it was causing error here. I think there's a problem with this function, this create function, which should be the latest inserted.

48:24 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Do you have experience with Superbase?

48:31 - Chinmay Pandya 
I do not have with Superbase. But what I tried to do here is, because it was not inserting, I just ran the code to, for it to insert, then I called the two days check and it will fetch the most recent again.

48:46 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I'll send you, let me send you the documentation for superbase SDK. It's very simple. You've worked with Postgres databases before, right? Yeah. Postgres, right?

48:54 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

48:55 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Okay, so you should have no trouble understanding it, and then it's just a matter of looking at the documentation reference.

49:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay, yeah.

49:02 - Chinmay Pandya 
Also when you when you call get today's check-in, do you want only one single item to return or Don't just send link to one of them.

49:11 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, that's the wrong one sends link to super base slash SSR Sorry, I didn't get Is it different yeah, it's slightly different I'm talking about like just the basic API calls. Yeah, you were looking at the wrong ones. Like just these ones. Yeah, I just sent a link to one of them. It's not SuperBase.js we're using, even though that's the one that's still listed there. They're phasing it out and replacing it with SuperBase SSR. But the only difference between SuperBase.js and SuperBase SSR is how you create the client, not how you use the client. So just how a client is created and how authentication is performed is different. But how you make normal API calls, that's the same thing.

50:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

50:21 - Chinmay Pandya 
But the goal of the today's check-in function is to fetch one check-in or multiple check-ins?

50:32 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
One check-in. So, so every day there's one check-in object. And the idea is that every day the user checks in. So there's a new one that created every day for every user. Yeah.

50:42 - Chinmay Pandya 
Because the current code fetches multiple check-ins.

50:48 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
No, I think it does single.

51:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
So this is the today's check-in and it returns an array of anything.

51:12 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Oh yeah, there should be single there.

51:15 - Chinmay Pandya 
Yeah, I tried adding single, but since I didn't know superface that well. Yeah, no, I'll go, I'll go.

51:29 - Unidentified Speaker 
So, I'll love you guys.

51:31 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
I'll let you guys go through whatever you guys need to go through. And then tomorrow we can regroup.

51:38 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, can I have this? Let me try this.

51:47 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Hello, hello? You have to set the output.

51:50 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2

51:55 - Biwas bhandari 
You'll be Firefox. Oh.

51:59 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Hello?

52:01 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, you have to turn the volume up a lot. It's the same thing for me.

52:04 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
That is not speaking.

52:07 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

52:07 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
Can you guys speak? Yeah, it's working. Oh, there. Okay. I was checking on the graph.

52:14 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
So one thing I wanted to ask is, are you guys going to be peer programming, or how is this going to be organized?

52:23 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
For me, what I think is best, I've never tried, I don't have experience with it, but just hypothesis is that maybe like a combination, maybe 40% peer programming and then solo. And that way, the peer programming is a mix of staying aligned, but also learning from each other.

52:42 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 2 
Yeah, so when you guys are getting on, probably message each other that you're online, and if both people are online at the same time, try to get in the call as fast as possible, sync up on everything, just get used to working in a team. And if you feel it's appropriate, start a pair programming sessions. I can say from experience that pair programming is one of the best ways to learn how to program and how to run a project ever.

53:11 - Chinmay Pandya 
Cool, cool, cool.

53:15 - Unidentified Speaker 
Alright, sounds good.

53:18 - Conference Room (Jorge Lewis) - Speaker 1 
So I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

53:22 - Unidentified Speaker

55:46 - Biwas bhandari 
I haven't used it much. I've only used it in LangChain. Agent. Banana. Router. That's it. First time using Lang Graph.

55:56 - Unidentified Speaker 
But it's good. Yeah.

56:00 - Chinmay Pandya 
We'll figure it out.

56:01 - Chinmay Pandya 
There's no new code.

56:03 - Chinmay Pandya 
It's just LangChain. But the graph and nodes are different.

56:10 - Chinmay Pandya 
ok bro, let's meet tomorrow ok, today I am working on the collector now my quota is over so I will start again tomorrow morning if there is any quota, I will do it ok, I will try to figure out the collectors do you have the documentation link?

56:38 - Biwas bhandari 
Langchan's Superverse I haven't used. I was only using MongoDB and MySQL. I'll send you a link.

56:50 - Chinmay Pandya 
I'll send you the documentation link in the Discord chat.

56:56 - Chinmay Pandya 
Okay. Let me know if you have any extra resources.

57:00 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

57:13 - Chinmay Pandya 
Where did it go?

57:23 - Biwas bhandari 
I sent it.

57:24 - Chinmay Pandya 
This was just a multi-agent. I was also looking at this.

57:29 - Biwas bhandari 
But it has a router.

57:30 - Chinmay Pandya 
It doesn't need a router. It has a supervisor in the code too.

57:43 - Biwas bhandari 
using supervisor, he was also using multi-agent collaboration using supervisor, he was using multi-agent collaboration actually in multi-agent, router is better we'll have to see I'll do it tonight, if there's any error I'll inform you, you can check it in

58:05 - Chinmay Pandya 
the morning If you figure out something or work on it, let me know. I'm sleeping, when I wake up, you go offline, I'll see.

2:05 - Biwas bhandari

2:18 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so I'm following you now.

2:25 - Jorge Lewis 
OK.

2:34 - Biwas bhandari 
ok yeah this is pretty much so let me first explain the code to you and this one is for authentication and the red is for recreating server field and password and this one is for fetching code which inputs plus and filtering it. For example, if the same Read.AI ID and title is in the repository, then it will not pass it to the evaluator of the relevant data.

3:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes. Can you try improving your mic? It's very tough to hear you. Do you not have any other headset at home?

3:22 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me change it.

3:28 - Jorge Lewis 
Maybe if you hold it to your mouse, it'll be better. I don't know.

3:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you hear me now better?

3:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, now it's much better. I can hear you clearly.

3:41 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh.

3:44 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, that's it. And for the prompts, I'm just passing the context from here.

3:54 - Jorge Lewis 
You can see.

3:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, OK.

4:00 - Biwas bhandari 
This one I just copied from the Python code.

4:09 - Biwas bhandari 
So...

4:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so what you were working on was trying to add a button, right?

4:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. So I want to call, this one is the function that calls all the, at first it calls the, it fetches the post and it evaluates it and then tests it in the database. So this is the main function.

4:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, I see. So that function, by the way, should be called, it should be more than process posts. It's also fetching them. That name could be pretty misleading. If I see that function when I'm calling it, it's not very clear that it's processing. I would imagine since the file that it's in, for example, is in evaluation, I would think that it's not very, it's not fetching the post, but it is.

5:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so there's one concept of a spell kit and that's the server files which is, so okay, So we're not going to be able to do a lot of, it's not going to be very helpful if we do SvelteKit stuff right now because the most efficient way to do this is for you to go through the tutorials, the SvelteKit tutorials, which are great. And then once you do those tutorials, then we can do some programming because There's a very basic, well sorry not basic, but there's just an introductory concept where you have server files and then you have page files.

6:33 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I know, I have read about it, I cannot import the server function in the content, so I think I basically need to create a route.

6:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, exactly. But this is actually not a server function. Server functions should be inside the server folder there in lib slash server. Yeah. So you can, you can just move your file folders.

7:02 - Biwas bhandari 
I had to do that. First of all, I need to move all my folders inside.

7:14 - Jorge Lewis 
All right.

7:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I mean, if they run on the server, you probably want them, well, yeah, they need to be in the folder.

Obviously, it depends on the project. If no one else is working on the project, it's obviously gonna be less likely, but it should be a habit that every day you're pulling, it should be on the back of your head always.

15:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Issues of... No, I think that won't work.

15:14 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no. Alright, so right now, we need to make a button that calls the function, right?

15:21 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, also, since I'm calling it, it's only showing post and this one, but it's not showing here. Why is it relevant or not? Why do we need to show that?

15:40 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't need that. I don't need why it's relevant or not.

15:47 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay. And that's good.

15:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Like for something like that, it's the same thing when you were working on the prompts, improving the prompts. You have to understand. So this is not specific for this project. I'm trying to teach you this so that when you're working on the client's projects, it's going to be a big issue. If you're working on something that doesn't align with them, it's going to be a very big issue because for them, to them, that means that they're paying you money to work on something they don't need, they don't care about. And they're going to question your competence and your character. Why did you not ask me before? Is this important? Stuff like this, right?

16:31 - Biwas bhandari 
The relevance reason is not important to you, you are just fetching the data and putting it in the frontend.

16:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, right now, like for example, right now the current version, it doesn't have it. I don't need it right now. Because, yeah, just what I need right now is not that. And that's exactly the process it should be. You ask me in a chat, hey, I was thinking it would be useful if I had the reason why it was relevant or not, or the reason why it was relevant, then I would say yes or no. And we'd be able to move from there rather than potentially spending time on that, right?

17:14 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Okay.

17:17 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. Oh yeah. So let's get this button in.

17:24 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

17:24 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. So open up the code and we'll go to... We'll figure it out. So which part were you struggling with? What have you tried so far and kind of where are you at?

17:34 - Biwas bhandari 
So yeah, for the bottom I have an alternative, right? If I just go to the search route, then it will automatically fetch it. I just told the sensitivity to make it.

17:53 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me just show you.

17:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's a search route?

18:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. In the route, there is... Sorry. These two codes are written by XAPT.

18:10 - Jorge Lewis 
If I enter, then you can see here.

18:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, because if it's fetching the duplicate post, it's not saving in the database.

18:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. Okay, so...

18:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, if I go into the solver, it will automatically fetch all the functions.

18:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so there's two ways we can do this. We can do it the really simple way and have it fetch on the load. So, what you're doing is fetching on load, right? Yeah. You've added the functions on load. The alternative is adding it to an action. Are you familiar with actions?

18:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
No.

18:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So an action is a spelt kind of thing that allows us to call a server function in the front end. So I could show an example. If you go into, I don't know. I mean, yeah, so I guess there's this, there's nothing inside it, but for example, it might look like this. We have, What is it, search or just do, what should we call the end point that we're trying to...

19:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, fetch post and evaluate. So this is what it looks like,

19:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold up.

20:05 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, where's my GIF co-pilot?

20:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, OK.

20:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay",8f001bda5d1b397037710ce3eb8434b1,['907f186de62a6dd5f7ae651d311ac2bf'],1200
57,7996f816269e5a2a3f5a5b4ca44275dd," it might look like this. We have, What is it, search or just do, what should we call the end point that we're trying to...

19:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, fetch post and evaluate. So this is what it looks like,

19:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Hold up.

20:05 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, where's my GIF co-pilot?

20:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, OK.

20:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so it takes in this, and inside here, so what we're doing is we're fetching. We don't return anything since the server function is calling on Superbase. So all we need to do is exactly what you did in the other function, which was calling this, the function, and let's just import it.

21:02 - Jorge Lewis 
It should be good. We don't need to return anything. In fact, since this is going to be a POST request... Oh no, this is a GET request. But we're not going to return anything. I guess we could. What does the fetch... Does it potentially return an F? The return is void.

21:31 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's not returning anything? Okay. So it's not returning anything.

21:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so instead of, usually I don't wrap things and try and catch. That's kind of a terrible practice to be using. There's of course the right place and right time to use it, but that's what I did before and it's great when you want something to work, but when you're trying to, now that we're integrating it into the app, If it errors, we don't want nothing to happen. We need to know it erred so that we can fix it if it's needed. So instead of logging error, we do... Because the console log error would be... It's one way to do it. So we're fetching the subreddit post and this returns...

22:19 - Jorge Lewis 
What if the Fetch subreddit, so okay, one thing I've noticed already so far is you're missing to add the potentials. Like if, for example, let's go into Fetch subreddit posts. This here. By the way, you can follow me, by the way. If you go into live share, you can click follow.

22:46 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

22:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So this function here returns a promise of a post, right? So you're returning here. The filtered post gets taken by this and filterExisting. So none of these actually have the ability to return null, meaning if there is an error, it will return undefined. We're not considering that at all. We don't give it the option to return none. This is exactly where we want to be checking if there's an error, so Okay, so if there's fetch error, then we're going to log it But then what happens okay, so you're using another try catch okay, but yeah, especially for so what I would recommend is Taking a look at some of the other code probably on adapt would be good, but taking a look at adapt and and seeing how we handle things like this. I'll go through now. I'm no expert, so if I write something that isn't the most optimal, oh well. But at least it's not a try-catch function.

23:52 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, so we're getting the data from evaluator's mission, select.

24:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

24:03 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm just fetching it from the superweb to see if the page post from Reddit ID is already there in the superweb. If it's there, it'll filter it out.

24:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So why are we selecting title here as well?

24:26 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, both are the same. I mean, I want to check if the Read.AI ID and title are there on my page. And sometimes there will be same title, and the reddit ID might be different. For example, if you post with a title, I need advice, and I will post with a title, I need advice. Both of our titles will be the same.

24:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, how did I do it?

25:00 - Jorge Lewis 
So, why are we not using the UUID?

25:15 - Biwas bhandari 
because uuid is generated by superweb but what we are trying to compare is the post we face from Read.AI for example if you post from Read.AI it will give us reddit id title something like that it will not give

25:33 - Jorge Lewis 
us uuid So the issue that I can see here, and I think it's good that you didn't actually do what I'm about to suggest, is that the title and the Reddit ID, the Reddit ID isn't actually too unique. It's a five character long, I believe, ID, right?

25:56 - Jorge Lewis 
So by no means is that supposed to be unique. That's not the unique identifier in the program. So the case, so right here, can you explain? I actually don't know. We're checking that ID doesn't match. Oh, wait, no.

26:11 - Biwas bhandari 
No, it was just map before. Oh, yeah, this thing, yeah, yeah.

26:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, and then if there's a fetch error, but this can just always be, if there's only one function, like one super base call, we can call them exactly what they are.

26:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

26:30 -",7996f816269e5a2a3f5a5b4ca44275dd,['907f186de62a6dd5f7ae651d311ac2bf'],1200
58,b1d319e2d84fe356bed282bd61947b5b," doesn't match. Oh, wait, no.

26:11 - Biwas bhandari 
No, it was just map before. Oh, yeah, this thing, yeah, yeah.

26:16 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, and then if there's a fetch error, but this can just always be, if there's only one function, like one super base call, we can call them exactly what they are.

26:27 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

26:30 - Jorge Lewis 
But yeah, so we can just.

26:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I can't rename, I guess.

26:47 - Jorge Lewis 
So, okay, so we're checking, we're fetching the existing submissions, and then if there's an error, we can get them, throw a new error. We don't want to be throwing, I don't think we want to throw errors here.

27:03 - Jorge Lewis 
I think this is a question I should ask Nazif, because error handling with, well, web dev in general, but especially stock kit, is something pretty hard to get right. So figuring out, asking Nazif how to do that properly might be a good idea. So actually, I'm going to leave it here, and you can ask Nazif later.

27:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Did you make the set function?

27:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Is this built in or?

27:34 - Biwas bhandari 
No. Yeah, the third one is built in.

27:39 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, what does it do?

27:42 - Biwas bhandari 
It will just set it like a cassette.

27:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Like a what? Store it.

27:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Your mic's pretty muffled again.

27:58 - Biwas bhandari 
Can you hear now?

27:59 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, yeah.

28:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, this set will just store it like a cache.

28:06 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry, your mic's again gone, it's too quiet.

28:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Hello?

28:11 - Biwas bhandari 
There we go, yeah, that's good.

28:13 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, the set, what this set does is it stores this in a cache.

28:22 - Jorge Lewis 
In a what?

28:24 - Biwas bhandari 
Cache, C-A-C-H-E, what do you call it? Oh, cache.

28:28 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

28:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see. The big problem with that is that this is a server function, so we can't be using a cache on the server.

28:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Do you understand how the architecture of a server client works?

28:52 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, mostly.

28:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so using that, do you understand why we can't cache on the server?

29:03 - Biwas bhandari 
Let me think.

29:20 - Biwas bhandari 
No, no idea.

29:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So the clients is the users. The server is not the users. The server belongs to all of the users. And in that way, it belongs to none of the users by themselves. So when we try to cache an individual user's or an individual client's results, that's a bad practice because we could technically... So the server is considered like a machine. It's just like a computer, right? We can store the user's results on there. But if we have 10,000 users storing the results on there, number one, is it going to have problems with scalability? Because caching is very expensive. But number two is it's a terrible practice because a server is made not to be used to store user stuff. You never want to store anything on the server. All you want to do on the server is call a function, produce an output, and return that output. That's always what a server is used for.

30:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Usually when you want to do caching, you add a layer of caching. So for example, so you have these, you have the clients and then you have, let me just, you have a client, you have a server sometimes, and then you have the database in between. Oftentimes you have a, so for example, before when we were using, when we were using Python, we were using Reads. Reads is a tool that allows you to cache things. So your server calls on Reads for its cache and then uses that instead of, you know, this is kind of the structure that you want to be using if you want to use caches. There's obviously other solutions. You can cache it on the clients on using local storage or something, or you can cache it using database, but probably the most, the simplest option is usually the clients using local storage is my guess. But yeah, so usually we don't want to, we don't want to, store, cache things on the server. You don't want to save any user data on the server especially. That's kind of a... Because if I save anything on the server, it's very likely that it's not safe. That's first of all. And just a whole bunch of reasons why not to.

31:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Got it. You can just add your command not to use it.

31:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so what is this actually doing here? Getting the IDs?

31:43 - Biwas bhandari",b1d319e2d84fe356bed282bd61947b5b,['907f186de62a6dd5f7ae651d311ac2bf'],1200
59,59e8844135d3a8506b3a141246fdca88," the server especially. That's kind of a... Because if I save anything on the server, it's very likely that it's not safe. That's first of all. And just a whole bunch of reasons why not to.

31:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Got it. You can just add your command not to use it.

31:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so what is this actually doing here? Getting the IDs?

31:43 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. Mapping the IDs.

31:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So we can just do that, right?

32:08 - Jorge Lewis 
What's the function? Is it includes?

32:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So we're checking the existing Read.AI IDs. Yeah, okay. So the problem with this, by the way, is like I said, the Read.AI ID isn't unique. So the issue with that is that maybe there's a post with the same ID. It's very rare since they're pretty, like, they're not impossible to get the same, but they're also very, like, they look very different. So it's something that we need to consider for the longterm, but for now it's fine, right?

32:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So we'll leave that for now. Obviously, we shouldn't be fetching every time is the first thing, but yeah, so we can figure it out later.

32:55 - Jorge Lewis 
So existing, I guess we're getting the IDs. We're checking if...

33:12 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

33:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, you're checking both.

33:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

33:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay. Yeah, I mean, fair enough.

33:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Although, yeah, I mean, I wonder if there's ever a time where, because like, the Read.AI ID, that was random, the title, people make them themselves. So I'm wondering if, like, if I'm a person with an idea, On the subreddits, often I see that people posting very similar titles. So I wonder if we might lose something.

33:48 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I encountered one. It was fetching two with the same ID.

33:59 - Jorge Lewis 
But like different posts or like different people?

34:03 - Biwas bhandari 
No, I didn't check that, but I just console logged the title and two of them were the same.

34:11 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so people cross post, they post on different subreddits, so that would make sense. So what we could do is do check for title and user.

34:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Or even, I think.

34:26 - Biwas bhandari 
We can filter it with username.

34:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, if you check for username, we don't need the same, we don't need one user twice. That's a good point, so. So we can do.

34:40 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, I should have done that before.

34:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, no, it's fine. That's what we learned. So that's why it's good that we're doing this like super fast because then you learn this. If you made this system perfectly, you wouldn't, like it's impossible to kind of predict that you would make this mistake. So it's just great to make things fast. Okay, so we return new posts. If there's no new posts, so this could just be empty. Okay.

35:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it'll just be empty if there's no. Oh, yeah.

35:17 - Biwas bhandari 
If all the posts are duplicated, it will not pass anything.

35:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So I mean, if it errors, if this superbase call errors, we'll be console logging, and then we'll throw this error. But I want to just not throw that error for now.

35:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So now we're getting an error saying that this might be null, data submissions. So one common thing that we do when we're, directly after we call a super base call, we do if error to check if the error is right, but also and if the data is not null. So this way. We know that there is some data that we return. Because if it's empty, well... Yeah, because it shouldn't be... It's possibly null. Why is it saying... Is this...

36:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Is your IDE commenting that out as well? Like, erroring this?

36:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

36:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, but I'm checking right here, no?

36:40 - Biwas bhandari 
I think we just need to...

36:43 - Jorge Lewis 
If error... Oh wait, no, sorry, whoops, this should be or.

36:47 - Biwas bhandari 
No, we can just... I had a question mark here.

36:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't know, we try not to use question marks. That's... Question marks... What question mark does is it just... That it's not null, but if this was saying it can be null, that's a totally different thing. What's the or operator in TypeScript?

37:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Is it just or?

37:13 - Jorge Lewis 
It's right?

For me, it's like different colors, these two. It looks really annoying.

37:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, but now it's still airing. I don't know. Look, if I do this, that should stop airing. Well, no, without your thing.

37:32 - Biwas bhandari 
I want to learn this. Why is it... Okay, let's try...

37:37 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so...

37:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Bro, I see exactly why so we're checking if it's not if it's null if it's null Then we're going to do nothing. We still go through with this. So Right here. We should be doing We should be returning an empty list. Oh That way we stop going through this function Okay Okay, so yes, that was why. See, if I said, okay, let me just do this here, I would have forgotten that we should be doing this proper error checking.

38:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, yeah.

38:33 - Jorge Lewis 
And sometimes you want to move fast, but sometimes it's better to write good code. There's a balance.

38:45 - Jorge Lewis 
I do the same. Sometimes I will add a question mark even though I should be error checking.

38:52 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so this is returning the new post, so we'll go back to where it's been called, which was, where was it being called?

39:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, here.

39:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Here?

39:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Here.

39:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me just close all the tabs, because I'm lost. Do we have the, I start always from the page.spelt, and then the server file that's calling it. Then we can go down here. So this is the main function that we're running. We're fetching this. If anything happens and it errors, it's just going to return an empty list. So I think, actually, this one, we fixed the other function, not this one. So yeah, there's a lot of try-catch. Oh, man. No, no, no. No more try-catches. I hereby ban you to try and catch.

39:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, okay. So, okay. You're, you're doing it.

39:46 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh, what is it? Bad practice. Yeah.

39:51 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so what was the, okay. So for the try and catch, what do you, what do you think you're going to catch? Like, uh, what's the thought process? What are you worried that my error that we're trying to catch?

40:02 - Biwas bhandari 
Um, sometimes we can just, uh, uh, I mean, uh, wrong username and password. So it will just generate another.

40:15 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's go step by step. So over time, at the very start, if you're a very beginner, try and catch this faster. But at my level, when you understand how to do error checking, it's very fast. I'm not good. Nazif can do this probably in a second. It's going to take me at least a minute or two.

40:35 - Jorge Lewis 
So for fetch functions, if there's no response, it'll be a null, right? I think. Or no, it'll be an empty response. It'll give this as something. So if there's, if it's not okay, is this correct by the way? I don't know the best practice, like for, if we're checking if it's okay. I know there's.

41:04 - Jorge Lewis 
Cause I think there's, there's a lot of ways to check if the response did well. Let me, I'm asking co-pilot. Let's see. Yeah, it should be fine. Okay, so we're just checking if it's not okay. Error. Parse the...

41:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Yep.

41:28 - Jorge Lewis 
New... Whoa. This is data, data, data.

41:34 - Biwas bhandari 
Is there...

41:36 - Biwas bhandari 
No, we can just change this.

41:46 - Jorge Lewis 
So I think an easier way of doing this, or a cleaner way of doing this is, now don't throw any heat, but that. Nope, not that.

42:17 - Biwas bhandari 
Yep. Did you make it yourself?

42:19 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

42:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Is it exactly the same as when you return?

42:25 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah. I first check the response and make it. Okay.

42:30 - Jorge Lewis 
So, so if it, like if it's, if it's exactly the same, then we can do, we can return this data as posts as a list of posts, I believe. Um, Oh, wait, no, this is JSON, so we can do it. So I'm trying to, so the benefit of TypeScript is typing, getting the types. So that's what I'm trying to do here because, I mean, in the end here, you are getting the type as a list of posts. But I'm trying to figure out if there's a better way to do it. Usually, this is something that we should be learning in general, kind of learning how to do types.

43:24 - Jorge Lewis 
For example, Nazif, he's the most experienced web developer on our team. If he can look at our code and say, ew, then we need to improve it. That's always what I think of Of course, if I'm working on a project that's not going to exist tomorrow, then it doesn't matter, but the idea is that you learn it so that when you make a very fast project, it should be natural.

43:50 - Jorge Lewis 
So if, should this actually be, if it's exactly the same, we can cast this here. Can we not, or?

43:59 - Jorge Lewis 
I wanna see, actually, let's, I just wanna see. So I wanna, I want to see what is actually, what that looks like, Can I, can you run that?

44:29 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, wait, I don't think we've set up the, I don't know if it'll actually run yet. Let's, let's, okay, let's, let's come back here. Okay, we'll come back here to fix all the types and make this code cleaner, but for now we'll finish connecting it up. Okay, so we're, we're calling, fetch, although we don't need a return fetch since fetch is a void, so we're not returning anything here actually. We actually don't even need to store it as a variable. Why are we storing void, right? Okay, so let's continue down this chain. So actually, I think this should work. We need to call it now. So we go into a page file and Here, let's find a button to attach. Let me run it locally as well, so I don't have to. Actually, I can see your screen. So I'm going to ask you to just swap to the web view every now and then.

45:24 - Jorge Lewis 
So we're here. Where can I add the button? Let's add the button inside Data Table. Because if you look at the web view right now, on Chrome.

45:42 - Jorge Lewis 
like if you look at the web on like the web the front end yeah like like on your browser okay well now you can't see it anymore but what how it is is okay let me oh I didn't finish cleaning up the code previously I left a try-catch somewhere Okay, let's fix the try-catches.

46:14 - Biwas bhandari 
Come back to me.

46:42 - Jorge Lewis 
You there?

46:50 - Biwas bhandari 
You there?

Hello, hello?

47:04 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, hello?

47:06 - Biwas bhandari 
You there?

47:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

47:09 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, cool.

47:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So, oh yeah, so what I was doing, I just finished removing the try catch, because I forgot to remove the catch part. So now I should an error, I don't think so.

47:54 - Biwas bhandari 
Did it call it?

48:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, nice. Okay, so if you see the filter using ID or something, we wanna add the button on the right of that.

48:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, I wanna add it on the right of that. So inside the code, what is that? Okay, here, I found the component. So this is the component that is Oh, you stopped following me.

48:26 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

48:26 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. So this here is the input component. So this is a flex. Let's make it a flex row and then add it here. So we can add a button, Shadestand button with an on click.

48:39 - Biwas bhandari 
Oh, you are using Shadestand.

48:43 - Biwas bhandari 
I'm using what?

48:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Shadestand.

48:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all Shadestand here.

48:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And then inside here, what do we call it?

49:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Don't spam.

49:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't want to get my Read.AI account banned for spam. So here we're going to call the function for fetchPost",f502b11205c8a44ec453a2a357bd116e,['907f186de62a6dd5f7ae651d311ac2bf'],1200

48:45 - Jorge Lewis 
Shadestand.

48:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all Shadestand here.

48:53 - Jorge Lewis 
And then inside here, what do we call it?

49:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Don't spam.

49:06 - Jorge Lewis 
I don't want to get my Read.AI account banned for spam. So here we're going to call the function for fetchPostAndEvaluate. So we create that up here. We'll do, yeah, okay, thank you very much. Ha ha, Copilot.

49:31 - Jorge Lewis 
But this is actually wrong, so see, that's why Copilot can't save you. It maybe saves you a lot of time, but this should actually, like, if you don't understand any of the code, then you'll be totally lost. This should be fetch, post, and evaluate. So this is the endpoint that we're trying to access through the page server file right here, so this one. And you do that by doing question mark slash to reach this end point here. Post, sure. I mean, we're not returning anything, so post works. I think it makes it more simple, actually.

50:05 - Jorge Lewis 
And then string of filter value, we don't need to pass it anything. So what if we don't pass it anything? Can I just not pass it? All right. I think that works.

50:18 - Jorge Lewis 
We can just log the data, sure. I added a console log for me. Thank you. Okay, so now it should work, I think. Let's try it.

50:26 - Biwas bhandari 
Let's give it a go.

50:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so it did call it properly. So let's check out the object.

50:49 - Biwas bhandari 
I think we need to remove that. Sorry? Giving us this error. It's OK.

51:19 - Jorge Lewis 
form actions expects form encoded data okay so what do we do is we're going to google it go ahead all right this is all you I'll guide you with my experience but I want to see how you solve this this bug so we have a bug that we've never seen before pretend pretend like i've never seen it and now you're going to tackle it I think I just need to now if it will But you have hot reload on, you don't have to refresh the page.

52:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay.

52:09 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so my tip here is you have no clue what this is saying, what the error is saying. The error tells you the problem, but you have no clue what it's telling you. So what do you do? You Google. Or you try GPT? I would use probably Google.

52:30 - Jorge Lewis 
The annoying thing with Spellkit is that there's not a lot of resources on it, and it's a really new framework, so try GPT isn't as good with Spellkit as it is something like React.

52:44 - Jorge Lewis 
You're using Tmux or?

52:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Are you able to copy and paste from the terminal?

52:52 - Biwas bhandari 
Okay, yeah.

53:07 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, I see the issue. I think.

53:10 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah.

53:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Wait, but... Yeah, I mean...

53:20 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, I'm gonna fix the issue to check if I understand it. Okay, can you run it again? I think I fixed it.

53:29 - Biwas bhandari 
Don't look at the code.

53:40 - Jorge Lewis 
Did it not work?

53:44 - Jorge Lewis 
It shouldn't even be, why is it erroring now?

53:50 - Jorge Lewis 
Have you refreshed the page?

53:56 - Biwas bhandari 
No.

54:21 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, is it saying? Yeah, what the heck?

54:36 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, it's lagging.

54:43 - Biwas bhandari 
Alright, I'm gonna go get a coffee, I'll be right back.

54:48 - Jorge Lewis 
You can continue working on this for now.

54:54 - Jorge Lewis 
By the way, I can see, I know the error now, but I'll leave you to solve it, you got this. If you want a hint, it's related to how the...

55:07 - Jorge Lewis 
It's related to, it's not SpokeKit specific, it's post versus get requests. Like what's the difference and how do they work? So that's their tip.

Have you found it?

58:14 - Biwas bhandari 
No idea.

58:15 - Jorge Lewis 
All right, so it's not actually, it's a very expected bug, like it's not unexpected. So how I would go about this problem is I would read the error. So let's go back to the error.

58:33 - Jorge Lewis

58:33 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay.

58:36 - Jorge Lewis 
So the error says, Svelte kit form actions Okay, yeah. I think I got it. But...

59:32 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's going to be very hard for you to solve this.

59:44 - Jorge Lewis 
if you don't understand to a basic how, the basics of how posts and get requests work, and kind of how those work. So what we're saying is a header is kind of to define how the, kind of defines the rest of the function, I guess you could say.

1:00:13 - Jorge Lewis 
provides additional, like it tells the server or whatever we're interacting with about the request that we're making. So in this case, the content type we're telling it is we're passing you this type of content.

1:00:30 - Jorge Lewis 
But we're in a post request, so we're telling it, so beforehand, by the way, so this is actually supposed to be JSON. We're usually passing it JSON, but the reason So we're telling it, OK, the content type we're going to pass you is JSON. But we're not passing it at anything, because I deleted the body request, the body of it. We told it, hey, we're going to pass you JSON, but we're not returning any JSON.

1:00:59 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's either we can just give it empty data, and that works. Or I believe there's a content type that's kind of empty.

1:01:10 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me see. So the option is, we don't need to pass it any data. We don't need to pass the function anything. So either we can pass it something empty, or we could figure out if there's a content type that says empty. But I don't think there is. So what we'll do is we'll pass it an empty JSON.

1:01:38 - Jorge Lewis 
Um, and now it should work. Oh yeah.

1:01:44 - Jorge Lewis 
Actually, there might be an error, but not with the actual, uh, request.

1:01:53 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

I was from the error was like 26 minutes, three 26.

1:02:08 - Biwas bhandari 
Yeah, now it's 27 already.

1:02:14 - Jorge Lewis 
So click the fetch post, yeah?

1:02:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Is that the error? That's the old error.

1:02:21 - Biwas bhandari 
Is it being clicked or not?

1:02:27 - Biwas bhandari 
Why isn't it not being clicked?

1:02:30 - Jorge Lewis 
That maybe means there's no error.

1:02:36 - Jorge Lewis 
Or nothing's happening, or what?

1:02:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh my, your laptop is just...

1:02:50 - Jorge Lewis

0:00 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you hear me?

0:01 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

0:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah.

0:03 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool. So let's tease apart what's going on. So where are we? Obviously, there's the self-inflicted pressure in terms of we had expectations and hitting that. Is that where you or is there something in how I am or we're engaging with you that's putting more pressure on you guys or?

0:21 - Jorge Lewis 
So there's definitely the self-inflicting part, which is we want to impress. That's on us. The solution to that one is just start sharing our dev chats to you. And that way, we have no pressure. It's just you're getting the full behind the scenes. But then there's also, I mean, if that solution solves the other issue, which is that you're constantly asking for updates, then that's a perfect solution. But if it still doesn't, you require more like daily explanations in terms of what's going on. And then it does feel like, it feels like you're expecting deliverables every day.

0:58 - Cuan Mulligan 
So definitely not expecting deliverables every day.

1:04 - Cuan Mulligan 
I've been doing product delivery for 25 years, so I know that's unrealistic and it's not useful.

1:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think when, for example, if I said to you, I'm going to give you 10 pounds on Friday, And then on Wednesday, I know that that's not going to happen. Me telling you straight away and saying, listen, sorry, that's not going to happen. Here's why. Here's what we're going to do about it. And here's when you're going to get it. That's what I mean by managing expectations. So as soon as you understand that something can't be done, it's setting those expectations of, hey, And let's be candid about it. This isn't going to happen. Here's why. I get software changes. But this is when you are going to get it. And this is what our confidence is. Yes, obviously, things can slip again. We get that. But at the moment, from my point of view, there's a huge amount of trust on my side that I'm assuming you guys are working. I'm not seeing stuff that I can play with. I feel from my side, I've tried to lean in and say, OK, Let's get this sort of visual contract of saying, I want to be able to do this. When can I get this thing? And that was supposed to be last Friday. And listen, I get stuff happens, and it's technology. It's never 100%.

2:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I think you're hitting on a really big point that's a part of this, where we don't acknowledge that you understand that software has delays. And we're trying to probably make up for it or compensate for it with just delays. So knowing that you truly do understand how software development is, then it does give us a lot more freedom to just say, yeah, this is what went wrong.

2:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that's more real. I'm not saying it's particularly any more pleasant, but it's more real. And I think it understands, you know, hey, we thought this plugin was going to work. It doesn't work at all. And we've lost a day. It's not great, but shit happens. And we get that.

3:18 - Jorge Lewis 
And it's better that you know that rather than us just saying, oh, sorry, it's going to be a day later.

3:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, because it's just like, Were you on the beach? Did you get hung over? Like, there's no, there's like, we don't know. Right. And obviously I'm speaking with JP and ARIF every day. And they're like going, Hey, cause when you tell me there's a demo on Friday, I'm obviously relaying that boat to the other ADAPT founders, but also to ARIF and JP, because they want to know how it's going and what my point of view is and what you guys are doing before they put their money into it. And, You know, I mean, listen, I think we both recognize that you guys are not a 400 person company. And that's one of the reasons why we like you guys, because we like your personality, we like your drive. And that's why we'd be interested in sort of partnering with you, because I think we can significantly add value to you guys and help you elevate your game. I think there's a three-year window to do something really, really interesting together before AI changes the landscape altogether and scares the shit out of everybody. But I think there's a short-term window to do something really interesting and impactful in the world with this tech. I just think we're fighting a tide of expectations. I was just on a webinar earlier on with ServiceNow, and they're unhelpfully putting out narratives that, you know, you can improve productivity by 70% with AI. Yes, if you want to use builder.ai and you say, give me a clone of Instagram or give me a clone of Facebook, yeah, it's an established pattern. As soon as you want to do something innovative, I'm sorry, you can't just go to software, hey, make this thing. It might come one day. I was watching an article last night saying",04025c260b3a737ebba61e7f9b20ea49,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],1200

As soon as you want to do something innovative, I'm sorry, you can't just go to software, hey, make this thing. It might come one day. I was watching an article last night saying that there's a multi-agent coding solution which has a test bot, a reviewer bot, coder bot, and they're giving each other's feedback. And it keeps on getting, the coder will keep on getting it wrong and keeps on getting feedback until it gets it right. And so that's quite clever.

5:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Was it called Devon?

5:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Could have been, yeah.

5:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Devon's very impressive.

5:40 - Cuan Mulligan 
But again, a lot of these things are happy path, right? So that's why I was asking you guys, what are you seeing? And yes, obviously you don't have the inefficiencies of large organizations, But I do wonder whether there is a conversation to say, like, how do we manage expectations? Like, could we use AI to manage expectations saying, hey, you know, not that it's of any value whatsoever if you know what you're talking about, but to say, hey, there was 7,000 lines of code written today. There was 15 check-ins. There was five issues. There's even something similar to that. We know something's happening. I don't put in particular, that doesn't mean the needle has shifted, but it does mean activity has happened. So that would be hygiene. I think the evolution beyond that is to say, I was reading a good article about the difference between a roadmap, a product roadmap, and a flight plan. Flight plan has to change the dynamics in the weather and stuff like this. And you have the ultimate goal, but your path there is evolutionary, and it responds to dynamic changes and stuff. So I built myself an hour if we did our first startup years ago, about 15 ago, which was building an AI project manager. We got gazumped by JIRA and Azure DevOps and stuff like that because we just couldn't because we had to use our underlying database and people wouldn't let go of Jira and DevOps because they were so integral to the solution. But people said, well, can you give us the bot? We really like that. So there's a lot of thinking that we've done. And again, another experiment to figure out is after we built this is, could we build an AI project manager to lighten your load from an account management point of view? I think there's some really interesting stuff we could do there. But that's another phase. So on this in particular, you asked some really interesting questions yesterday. And some of them makes total sense. And some of them felt that we weren't aligned, or I don't understand how the coding requires that sort of information. I think I had a preconceived idea of it working a different way. So can you sort of give me an update of where we are with stuff and how close we are to getting it in the next release so I can play with stuff?

7:57 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, how about I run you down and where the architectures are right now so you get an idea of what it's doing behind the scenes.

8:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Just give me two seconds. I want to see if Arif and JP are around. They might like to hear this.

8:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'll just give them this meeting link. If they can join, they can join. Um, okay, cool.

67,eff0d1e6b60c64b55471300e3e720d4c," in the brain, like the whiteboard, I need the drawing.

10:23 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, I get that. But okay, let's not start with the architecture because that's an implied thing that you need. Hey, JP.

10:33 - Cuan Mulligan 
Good morning.

10:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Hey, so where are we with the actual feature set going backwards from the customer, from us? When do you think I'll be able to play with it? We talked about a potential demo today. Is that feasible?

10:48 - Jorge Lewis 
So what I'm doing currently right now is trying to, so from Friday when we had the demo, what we had was the check-in bot specifically. So behind the scenes, they're split up into different modules. They all have the same persona, so they act like the same person. But behind the scenes, they're each specialized to do one thing. And in our case, I was working on the check-in bot. The check-in bot is comprised of the coach, data analyst, and the supervisor.

11:20 - Jorge Lewis 
So the supervisor, his job is to gather the data, then he sends it to the coach to provide coaching on the data that's given from the user, and then he can get further analysis from the data analyst if he wants or not. And then it goes back to the supervisor to repeat the loop. So that's the check-in thing, and that's what I was working on.

11:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
So this is a multi-agent system?

11:41 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it's evolved into that. I don't know if we're going to call it... It is a multi-agent system, but I don't know if we're going to call that because an agent is often, it can be defined as someone like with a persona. So we don't know yet. Behind the scene, it is very similar.

11:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Okay.

12:00 - Cuan Mulligan 
So a multi-agent system to the customer or the user would have an experience of working with three different people. But under the hood, what we're saying is it's one unified person experience, but there will be sub bots, sub agents, let's say, call them sub agents that are working together to achieve a particular outcome. And so you're niching up the capability into really thin slices so they can become experts in that one thing.

12:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Exactly. Yeah. And the reason so by Friday, what I had was I had one bot that had the capabilities to retrieve data from the database, get data from the database, and then provide some some coaching. But the performance wasn't that good. The one guy couldn't do it all. So we went into this route of delegating.

12:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
When you say performance, that's got multiple interpretations in terms of speed, in terms of accuracy, in terms of experience.

12:53 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, so speed is actually a very annoying thing because right now it's currently quite slow, but for the performance I was referring to was just the quality of Alpine didn't think it would be able to become I feel like if we modified the prompt, it wouldn't be able to, it's not flexible because we tell it to change one aspect. Let's say for your coaching, do this, do more of this. Then having it integrated within the entire bot, it's not a good idea because by separating them, we get to independently improve one of the modules. It would mess up the function calling quite a bit because function calling is surprisingly pretty difficult for language models. So separating that is usually the best idea. It gives us the most scalability in terms of capabilities and quality.

13:43 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So for me, there's a milestone I'm looking for, which is to have a version of the bot that we can interact with, pull in data from a profile, and then changing the foundational prompt so that that bot can change its responses to certain scenarios. Because that, I think, is going to give us more learning in terms of all the different types of edge cases of how people engage with it. So that was what I thought we'd have on Friday, and then it was talked about potentially today. So when do you think we can actually play with that?

14:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me keep going into the progress we've made so far, and then we can wrap that. So from Friday, that's what we had, the single bot trying to do everything. And then over the weekend, I worked on it. And by that point, we had the UI completed, but the reactivity was terrible. You'd have to refresh the page every new message just because of the way the backend was connected. Over the weekend, we fixed the reactivity, and I implemented the multi-agent architecture.

14:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
So just some feedback, by the way, especially to myself and Arif, because we are quite technical, giving us that level of granularity, saying, hey, listen, we've got this bit done, but the reactivity was really, really shit. That's fine. We would then understand that that's a realistic issue and a glass ceiling you've hit, and then say, hey, while functionally it hasn't improved, we've re-architected it to sort out the reactivity blocker. That's huge progress for us. Even though it's not getting us to the ultimate goal that we thought we'd get on the Friday, but we can understand that level of reality with dealing with software. It goes backwards and forwards and left and right",eff0d1e6b60c64b55471300e3e720d4c,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],1200
68,027d7b5025667133971f6666863353fd," fine. We would then understand that that's a realistic issue and a glass ceiling you've hit, and then say, hey, while functionally it hasn't improved, we've re-architected it to sort out the reactivity blocker. That's huge progress for us. Even though it's not getting us to the ultimate goal that we thought we'd get on the Friday, but we can understand that level of reality with dealing with software. It goes backwards and forwards and left and right. So having that transparency, I think, is really, really useful. JP, what about you? I know you're a clever guy, but I don't know whether that level of feedback is something that you'd want or not.

15:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
I pick up little bits, and I learn as I go.

15:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Over the weekend, we improved the reactivity and then I improved the bot system. By yesterday, I had finished what I was happy with in terms of architecture. Today, my plan was to fix the prompts to make them more aware of their environment. So pretty much tell them, hey, you're part of the system. You shouldn't have your own persona. You're part of this guy, right? All these things, and just improving the prompts here and there.

16:12 - Jorge Lewis 
By the way, to kind of give you some more context regarding prompting, there's one type of prompt, which is for the persona. And then there's another one that's for functionality. The functionality one is behind the scenes. The persona one is going to be editable by you guys. But I'm trying to figure out a way if we can make even the ones behind the scenes editable for you guys so you can iterate those ones as well.

16:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think that would be certainly from an Intelli agent one for JP. I feel that's probably where you're going to need to go because we can't specify the functionality to the end degree. So having an interface that we can modify the functionality while also the style of the personality, I think having those two levers would be super useful.

16:58 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

16:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
On the sort of the agents and having sub-agents, is there a sense that If the supervisor buzz goes left, even if you want to go right, you must listen to them. Is there a hierarchy of opinion, for want of a better word, in the bus? Otherwise, how are they going to stop? I think you called it a circle jerk. How do they not just get into a really nasty cycle of saying nice things to each other?

17:27 - Jorge Lewis 
So in the one for Adapt, there's not much hierarchy. The flow is usually very simple. So it's going to be gather the data, coach on the data. To coach on the data, he can pull more insights from a data analyst or not. But for something like for JP's one where it's sometimes have a circle jerk, just you have to allocate who has priority and who doesn't. But on top of that, the supervisor in Adapt's case is also the check-in manager, but his main role isn't to manage the conversation. His main role is to get data and then pass it on to the coach to provide coaching. So we could further add another layer on top, which is just a pure supervisor just saying, this is how the conversation should look like, If it looks like there's a power struggle, do this or this.

18:20 - Jorge Lewis 
So if we go into the graph.

18:28 - Jorge Lewis 
I shall send it. Can I send images here?

18:32 - Cuan Mulligan 
I should.

18:39 - Jorge Lewis 
How do I?

18:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, let me let me screen show you this.

18:51 - Jorge Lewis 
Can you guys see it? Yep. So at the top here, we have the supervisor, but this is also- Can AI rewrite the writing?

19:07 - Jorge Lewis 
We can. Let's see. Thank you. Thank you. See, I did try doing it in Excalibur, but sometimes I need the drawing of the whiteboard. Let's see. I know there's AI features.

19:26 - Jorge Lewis 
No. Oh, wireframe to code.

19:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Anyways, supervisor is going to start us off. So if the user says, let's check in, the supervisor starts off. The supervisor and the coach both have a tool to select the next speaker. This is to pass the baton to the next person.

19:50 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is that the next sub-agent?

19:54 - Cuan Mulligan 
The this one or we say speaker is that the person that the sub agent bot that's engaging with the customer person.

20:01 - Jorge Lewis 
This, this, this is a tool. So tools are, are just for the language models to call and for us to manage behind the scenes, like to allocate who should speak next. Right. So the blue ones are tools. They're not real people. This one's also supposedly a tool, the entry. So let's just go step by step. So the first one is he can select, all right, we've got some user data. Let's select the coach to speak next. So we'll start the coach off. This node here is just to introduce the coach to the scenario, saying, hey, we have this new data. Let's coach on it. And then we start into it. The coach can then select the next speaker, which could be the data guy or",027d7b5025667133971f6666863353fd,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],1200
69,7648221213e53e2e6750baebfdbe33d9," the entry. So let's just go step by step. So the first one is he can select, all right, we've got some user data. Let's select the coach to speak next. So we'll start the coach off. This node here is just to introduce the coach to the scenario, saying, hey, we have this new data. Let's coach on it. And then we start into it. The coach can then select the next speaker, which could be the data guy or go back to the supervisor.

20:44 - Jorge Lewis 
So this entry node is also just telling the data guy the context of the conversation so far. The solid lines, by the way, are non-conditional. So anytime the conversation is at the data guy for one message, he gives a response, and it'll go directly back to the coach. The dotted lines are conditionals, depending on some factors. And then after the coach maybe makes some coaching, he hands it back to the supervisor, and we usually repeat.

21:15 - Cuan Mulligan 
I'm just going to hide my camera because I'm going to start eating and I don't think any of you need to see it.

21:20 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I wouldn't mind.

21:23 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes. So that does that make sense? Albeit the beautiful handwriting.

21:29 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah. I mean, it does. But I suppose the real challenge is in the nuance of testing it.

21:38 - Cuan Mulligan 
Because it all looks fine on paper.

21:42 - Jorge Lewis 
When do you think we can actually start to like So let's so Jonas has been working on the front end side of things So this so this is you guys can still see my screen, right? Yeah. Yeah. So for example, I could select my chat and See, we had an issue this morning. I was working. I spent way too long trying to fix this issue. We're sending to the same messages, but, um, so yeah, we have the conversation going now, but I need to push the changes that I made today.

22:13 - Cuan Mulligan 
Could you, could you explain this? I think it's really useful context for us. So that we can understand, for example, if you're doing normal software engineering and you say you pass in two variables, like two numbers, and the addition of the number is the function of the module, 1 plus should be equal to 2. It always will be. Obviously, LLMs and this sort of work is a bit more fragile in that way. It's not as canonical or categorical. Can you explain to us why it started producing double responses and how did you fix it? I think this will just go a long way for us to start understanding the realities of software engineering in this way, that it's not quite the same as building a website.

22:55 - Jorge Lewis 
This was actually not the language model. It was something related to the code, our code.

23:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
OK. So the language model was giving you a single response, but for some reason you were displaying it twice?

23:08 - Jorge Lewis 
Uh, yeah, no, well, this, this is my, our side. So the right side is us. So this is me saying I'm 24 years old.

23:17 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay. So the UI is doubling what you said.

23:22 - Jorge Lewis 
Not even the UI. Behind the scenes as well, it was making two of the same messages. So for some reason, the bot would respond with one nice message. Perfect. But then the R side would keep putting two. And I finally fixed it. If this doesn't duplicate, I've done it. And it didn't duplicate.

23:42 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, so I think as soon as I push, I need to ask Jonas, because as soon as I push or merge my changes into the alpha branch, it'll be deployed. But I don't know if it'll work as is. So I need to check with Jonas on that one. But there's also, I don't know how good it looks at the moment, but let's take a look.

24:01 - Jorge Lewis 
There's the admin link somewhere. Let me find it.

24:08 - Jorge Lewis 
We've separated the chat interface, or we've made them into two separate projects so that, I mean, it doesn't make a difference on the user side, but for us, it makes it a lot easier to work with.

24:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
Next task.

24:26 - Jorge Lewis 
What should we do?

24:44 - Cuan Mulligan 
Eggs and bacon, Kevin? Eggs, bacon, avocado, six eggs. Six pieces of bacon and half an avocado.

24:54 - Jorge Lewis 
Sounds like...

24:57 - Cuan Mulligan 
I can't find the link.

25:02 - Cuan Mulligan 
It is interesting, though, that compared to using chocolate-covered, cream-filled eclairs or profiteroles, You can't quite eat the same number of eggs.

25:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's amazing.

25:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So yes, the admin page looks like this now. So you can review the responses. So this is the top dropdown is for you to select which user you want to go through. So let's just say mine.

25:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's say this response wasn't that good. You can click on it and you can select if it was a good or a bad response",7648221213e53e2e6750baebfdbe33d9,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],1200
70,339c80c45879b81d470b2aeba937bad3," eggs.

25:17 - Unidentified Speaker 
It's amazing.

25:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So yes, the admin page looks like this now. So you can review the responses. So this is the top dropdown is for you to select which user you want to go through. So let's just say mine.

25:35 - Jorge Lewis 
Let's say this response wasn't that good. You can click on it and you can select if it was a good or a bad response. If it was good, it takes us to this page where it's just the form. So this was the response we deemed as impressive. What was good about it? Where should the conversation... I think this part, I think we were supposed to ask you, but we didn't. Should a good, impressive response have a following field here?

26:01 - Cuan Mulligan 
Let me ask JP and Ira from this, actually. So the reason why I came up with this idea was not just the response, but where do you want the conversation to go after that response? Is there a particular direction you need to take it away from where you think you're going at the moment?

26:18 - Cuan Mulligan 
For example, let's say someone says, oh, I didn't do my walk because my kid went to hospital. And they said, oh, I'm really concerned to hear about that. That's a good response. But where do you actually go next? Do you go back to the previous point? Or would you say, actually, given this is a highly sensitive topic, do you actually now want to say, shall we pause this check-in and come back to you tomorrow?

26:46 - Cuan Mulligan 
It's that sort of stuff. That was the point of the follow-on. So you've got the immediate response, which is good, which could include a follow-on. But if it doesn't explicitly have one, the follow-on was, as a person, this is where I would go next.

27:01 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, OK. That makes sense.

27:03 - Arif Harbott 
Yeah, it's probably.

27:07 - Cuan Mulligan 
Up to the user you pose the question. Yeah, I think you're right. Are you okay to carry on today? Or do you want to just pick this up again tomorrow with the clear ahead? Yeah Because I'd imagine doing a marketing thing there's particular Sort of non-logical next steps that jp goes. Uh, if I saw that I'd want to go left or I'm like, oh fuck I would have gone, right?

27:29 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, that's the communication of your expertise completely that that's it's imperative that we direct them so that they don't decide what to do themselves, so to speak.

27:47 - Jorge Lewis 
Language models are very, what they do is predict the next set of text. They're very bad at skipping a step and going from the results to Like, if they're given the endpoint, it's very hard for them to try to reach it through messages. They usually just go straight to that point. So we'd have to, we should gather the data right here, we should gather the data, and we'd later end up finding a way to make it in a way that the language model would enjoy using.

28:19 - Cuan Mulligan 
Is it possible, for example, let's say you're running a workshop, And that workshop could be broken down into, have you ever heard of a business model canvas workshop?

28:31 - Jorge Lewis 
Canvas workshop for the business model.

28:34 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yes, a business model canvas is like a 12 box diagram of different steps. And there's a particular, there's an effective way that you travel through those steps. And so is there a way that we can create those steps that they must be finished. And then the steps must happen in that order, but the journey to go from step one to two is what's organic, but you have to get to two before you can start talking about three. Yeah.

29:05 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah. That's actually something similar to what we're doing for, for these sub modules. Cool.

29:16 - Jorge Lewis 
So this function here is to select the next speaker within the check-in cycle. So I've given it the standard check-in cycle looks like, The supervisor, he requests user tracking data, the coach gets it from the supervisor, the data analyst gets user from the tracking data, and then tries to provide useful insights. The coach uses this to create some coaching, and it's back to the supervisor. So giving it an example of the orders that we want is usually enough for it to understand how things go. And then sometimes, depending on how well we prompt and the examples we give it, it'll be able to do it pretty well, in between, I mean. Going from one to another, it does a good job.

29:56 - Cuan Mulligan 
Those sort of five points, I'm sorry, I think from an IntelliAsian point of view, being able to see those and add to them or change the order of them, I think is going to be imperative.

30:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sorry, excuse my ignorance, where are they sitting, those five points, as far as, it's in the code, obviously, at the moment, but where, as far as a user interface, is it part of a hard-coded prompt or is it something that's modifiable?

30:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's modifiable. We can bring it to the front end and bring it here. But this is",339c80c45879b81d470b2aeba937bad3,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],1200
71,d4fd4d0c862d571669267cbea8e94ab8," is going to be imperative.

30:07 - Jonathan Phillips 
Sorry, excuse my ignorance, where are they sitting, those five points, as far as, it's in the code, obviously, at the moment, but where, as far as a user interface, is it part of a hard-coded prompt or is it something that's modifiable?

30:25 - Jorge Lewis 
So it's modifiable. We can bring it to the front end and bring it here. But this is a simple one where there's no variables. But something more complicated like this one where we have variables like a profile ID. Or actually, let me go. Yeah.

30:53 - Cuan Mulligan 
I want all of these aspects of a prompt to be in an admin screen that we can tweak and modify.

30:59 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, so we need to figure out the best way to do that because it's obviously possible. Just what's the best way? I'm thinking the best way is just to use So you can see here, we give it a variable. This is a variable here, userInfo. And at the bottom, we give it as the actual value.

31:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
Sorry, I can't see your screen anymore. Is it just me? No, I've lost it as well.

31:27 - Jorge Lewis 
Oh, for just now or the whole time?

31:30 - Cuan Mulligan 
No, just now. Just now.

31:34 - Jorge Lewis 
Let me know.

31:38 - Jonathan Phillips 
Yeah, we're back.

31:42 - Jorge Lewis 
OK, so this part here, so this is a prompt for creating an agent. So we're passing it the user info, which is things like name, those things, right? It's given as a variable using the curly brackets. And then we set the value down here in the code. So we could, on the front end for that, make the curly brackets as a keyword for variable. And we need to tell you guys to not change those. That's the simplest way I can think of as of now. Later down the line, to make it more intuitive, we can make a drop, like an insert variable type of thing. But I don't think there's a need. We can use double curly braces if that's more intuitive and obvious.

32:20 - Cuan Mulligan 
I would just create a CRUD screen with those fields in it that we can edit. And then at runtime, you pull that down.

32:39 - Cuan Mulligan 
I think the risk of going into code and changing something accidental is way bigger. So anything that's changing stuff, I would want to control the experience just to be safe.

32:55 - Jorge Lewis 
Yes, the only one of the problem for the crud table you'd be so we would assign the variables, right? On the UI. But the value would have to be assigned later down the road.

33:11 - Cuan Mulligan 
Once you spin it up, that will pull down the latest value, and then we'd have to have some form of... If you changed it, it would have to refresh. Let's say you changed the personality variable. It would have to then take that new personality, so maybe there's a restart, a reboot, refresh, whatever. There has to be a way of pushing that change into the bot context so that it takes that new context into consideration going forward.

33:43 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, the concern is that so user, so let's say if we were to just drag this into a front end, we have the left side of the screen can be the prompts with the right side just being the variables. We can't assign the value in the admin page. It has to be done behind the scenes. So it has to follow a certain key. For example, the key would be user info.

34:12 - Cuan Mulligan 
I don't think we need to fix it now, anyway.

34:14 - Cuan Mulligan 
Yeah, we can go into that.

34:16 - Cuan Mulligan 
So when will this be deployed? Because it looks, you know, it's great to see this. It looks like it's actually, there's a whole load of stuff that's happened. When can we start to play?

34:26 - Jorge Lewis 
I mean, I could try pushing right now, if you guys want to see if that will work or not. Actually, never mind, we have a problem with Vercel. They've changed their pricing or their integration with GitHub. Only Jonas, oh, wait, no. Let me give it a go. Only one person from the accounts can now merge into Alpha. Let's find out.

35:07 - Jorge Lewis 
But I mean, yeah, I think Jonas is off for today. But if he's able to respond to my message, I can get it done myself.

35:18 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah, it doesn't let me.

35:22 - Cuan Mulligan 
How come he's away today? Sorry, I didn't know.

35:25 - Jorge Lewis 
Sorry. Jonas, I think he's just off for dinner with his girlfriend's family.

35:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so if you can get a copy of it and let us know when you can push so we can test it because...

35:42 - Jorge Lewis 
He's off for my day. His day starts at the normal time. I start late.

35:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I can get him back on.

35:54 - Jorge Lewis 
But if this doesn't have any issues, like with the actual connecting with",d4fd4d0c862d571669267cbea8e94ab8,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],1200
72,b99a3823a6e496f69fbc0331e47e66f8,"'s family.

35:36 - Cuan Mulligan 
Okay, so if you can get a copy of it and let us know when you can push so we can test it because...

35:42 - Jorge Lewis 
He's off for my day. His day starts at the normal time. I start late.

35:49 - Jorge Lewis 
I can get him back on.

35:54 - Jorge Lewis 
But if this doesn't have any issues, like with the actual connecting with the front end when it's merged, then it should be...

36:03 - Jorge Lewis 
10 but it takes as long as Jonas can respond.

36:12 - Jorge Lewis 
So we've looked at the good response. Let's take a look at the bad one. Similar thing.

36:18 - Jorge Lewis 
The system prompts.

36:23 - Jorge Lewis 
So now we've separated the prompts into different aspects to give you guys some more room to work with. And this will later be the whole list of prompts that we're seeing that aren't added, like the system prompt for agents and things like this. So we'll add that later down the road. As of now, you can start playing with these. Yeah.

So does that include everything you guys were wondering, or have we missed anything?

36:59 - Cuan Mulligan 
I mean, yeah, we need to figure out what we can do. And yeah, if you can send over the latest URLs that we need to play with, and then we can start playing with stuff and giving feedback, that'd be great.

37:13 - Jorge Lewis 
Okay, sounds good. And then just to solve the issue of the daily progress is we'll start moving a lot of our tech chats into your guys' chats, or maybe we'll make a separate channel for us to put the tech-specific stuff, and we'll start just chatting there. Sound good?

37:30 - Jorge Lewis 
Yeah.

37:32 - Jorge Lewis 
Cool. I'll send the links right now, and then I'll let you know when they're playable.

37:41 - Jonathan Phillips 
Just just let you know as well the payment went through today so it should be in your account now Sounds good.

37:48 - Jorge Lewis 
Thanks so much I hope you could I've hope you've been able to see how we're able to apply some of the coins a lot of cool and stuff to To the most yeah that we're using well behind the scenes. We're using line graph. It's a pretty pretty new framework for for just LLMs. It uses a graph structure, which makes it super modular and flexible. I love it so far. It was different to what we were previously using, which was another framework by Microsoft Autogen, which was a lot more abstracted and less easy to work with. So this one hopefully gives us a lot more just grit and speed. Excellent.

38:26 - Cuan Mulligan 
Cool you.

38:27 - Cuan Mulligan 
Thanks guys so much for your time. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.",b99a3823a6e496f69fbc0331e47e66f8,['ef54bdf227f7bcd2411dbc36b3db7fcf'],649
